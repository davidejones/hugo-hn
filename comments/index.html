                    &gt; stimulant-based treatment of ADHD in childhood and adolescence does cause significant changes in brain structure. In a good way.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the literature showing evidence of reduced depression and suicide rates in adolescents who undergo long-term treatment with Ritalin and closely related drugs.<p>Are you aware of anything beyond that? Please cite the sources here so we can all learn. I have yet to see any conclusive evidence that the changes in brain structure and function are always &#x27;good&#x27;, and the previous citations I provided present evidence that counters your claim.

                    In general we do, because launching from west to east at the equator lets you use the Earth&#x27;s rotation for a 465m&#x2F;s speed boost. Launching the other direction means you need an <i>extra</i> 465m&#x2F;s just to counteract the rotation you started out with. Polar orbits don&#x27;t gain or lose much from the rotation since they&#x27;re aimed over the planet&#x27;s poles.

                    Yes I was about to say the same thing. Hash collisions are an <i>extra</i> concern about what apple is doing, but even if they were as collision free as cryptographic hashes, that would not make the invasion of privacy OK. The technical discussion is something that apple can easily parry and is the wrong framing of this debate.

                    What I don&#x27;t like about this article (besides the very obvious conclusions that it starts out with and then hits you over the head with) is that it doesn&#x27;t attempt to reach any wikipedia mod or reviewer for a comment. It&#x27;s only the author&#x27;s side and the author&#x27;s narrative. Also, correlation does not imply causation. The fact that women&#x27;s pages get deleted more often doesn&#x27;t mean that there is a gender bias against women.

                    Great point. A core cause of the endless wars in the middle east is people pushed into the truly evil British model of a minority in power over a weaker but larger other party. I get that there are lots of existing problems but doing this in countries on purpose is unforgivable.<p>My own country (the us) fucks things up too of course - Afghanistan being the latest example, but we have our own long list of shame (Iraq, many countries in south and central America...).

                    &gt;It was suggesting that we very temporarily give special treatment to a very small consumer of chips that has an outsized impact on production rate, in the midst of a global chip shortage.<p>Why would we do that if the fabs themselves don&#x27;t think it is worth paying their equipment manufacturers enough to afford their own chips?<p>Giving &quot;special treatment&quot; is a price control. It is forcing a transaction that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t settle at that price.

If people don&#x27;t feel safe participating today on some topic that haters have google alerts set up for, then those future archives will be heavily biased in favor of content that&#x27;s acceptable to the haters of that time.

                    Single file with an open standard binary format based on Protobuf or CapnProto. This idea of using text files by default is ancient Unix cruft. Use binary formats unless you have a damn good reason not to, always, and release open-source tools for reading and processing files in your format.

                    &gt; Now, my 8 year old Macbook Air is still more or less as functional and useful as it was when I got it.<p>This is my frustration with Apple&#x27;s policy of dropping support for hardware in MacOS.  It made sense in the 90&#x27;s to upgrade every 2-3 years because you got 1.5-3x more performance each time.  So 6 year old hardware was almost an order of magnitude less capable.<p>Fast-forwarding to today, a &quot;legacy&quot; 10 year old (&quot;Mid-2011&quot;) MacBook Pro supports just as much memory (16GB) as Apple&#x27;s current M1 offerings.  The M1 does put up some very impressive numbers on the single-thread CPU front, but that&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve gotten used to such small progress every year--it&#x27;s only about 2x the speed of the 2011 MBP for single thread tasks.

                    One of the problems with binary classifiers is that you can&#x27;t simultaneously make low errors in both directions. That&#x27;s not &quot;an institutional failure&quot;, that&#x27;s practically a law of nature. You have to live with the fact that sometimes you&#x27;re wrong.

                    Interesting point. I think it has two sides to it:<p>1. I started using Spacemacs which got me into using Emacs(mainly for org mode in the beginning). I&#x27;m not capable of building an emacs config from scratch(nor do I care).<p>2. In Vim though I already have my vim config and have been customizing it. When I try to use these neovim distributions, they&#x27;re very far off how I configured my vim and I have no idea how to reconcile these two things.<p>I feel like once you are capable enough to configure it on your own, you won&#x27;t really be happy with these things, but neovim is also almost like the ever changing javascript ecosystem. There are new completion engines coming out every day, new file trees, etc. etc. I don&#x27;t feel like changing to the next best lsp engine every 6 months.

                    Part of the reason fabs are spread out is capitalism: if you manufacture the part in the country, you don&#x27;t pay import taxes (e.g., Intel&#x27;s Ireland fab debacle).<p>Another part is lax environmental laws. Hillsboro Oregon is embroiled in a suit with Intel where Intel dumped 100x the fluorine into the air that they claimed when D1X was first pitched. Don&#x27;t need to worry about that stuff in Asia (for now).<p>Also, lead time. The x-ray litho machines take years to build and test. There are only two companies that make Intel&#x27;s testers, and the lead time is years. So a &quot;quick fix&quot; isn&#x27;t possible.<p>Speaking opinion: in the long term, it is mostly rich people trying to get richer that caused this. If greedy CEOs and shareholders would just be humans for once and think about the future we wouldn&#x27;t have this trainwreck. That ain&#x27;t ever gonna happen.

                    And by sheer coincidence, I very recently learnt on a HN linked article on big-endian and little-endianness that these terms come from Gulliver&#x27;s Travels by Jonathan Swift [0], where Lilliput and Blefuscu wage war over which end should be cracked first when eating a hard-boiled egg:<p>&gt; <i>The novel further describes an intra-Lilliputian quarrel over the practice of breaking eggs. Traditionally, Lilliputians broke boiled eggs on the larger end; a few generations ago, an Emperor of Lilliput, the Present Emperor&#x27;s great-grandfather, had decreed that all eggs be broken on the smaller end after his son cut himself breaking the egg on the larger end. The differences between Big-Endians (those who broke their eggs at the larger end) and Little-Endians had given rise to &quot;six rebellions ... wherein one Emperor lost his life, and another his crown&quot;. The Lilliputian religion says an egg should be broken on the convenient end, which is now interpreted by the Lilliputians as the smaller end. The Big-Endians gained favour in Blefuscu.</i><p>This seems like a perfect fictional example of the Narcissism of Small Differences, published more than a century before the birth of Sigmund Freud!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lilliput_and_Blefuscu#Satirical_interpretations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lilliput_and_Blefuscu#Satirica...</a>

                    Excel does a fairly bad job when moving data between two computers that aren&#x27;t configured the same way, which kind of defeats the purpose of using a data interchange format.<p>Where I work we have offices in the US, and in Europe where installing a localized version of windows will swap &#x27;,&#x27; and &#x27;.&#x27; when used as the group and decimal separator.  Excel when loading a value 100,002 in the US will see one hundred thousand and two, in some parts of Europe it will see one hundred and 2 thousandths.<p>Character set handing can be just as bad, there is no good way to get Excel to auto open a CSV file as UTF-8 that won&#x27;t break every other CSV parser in existence. The only cross platform option is ASCII. Excel will happily load your local OS encoding, likely some variant of ISO-8859, but any other encoding requires jumping through hoops.

                    EUV LLC was already heavily funded by DARPA in the 90s and is why we are able to have export restrictions on ASML machines used by TSMC for the latest EUV nodes etc.

                    It doesn’t matter if there are collisions if the two images don’t actually look the same. Do people honestly believe a single CSAM flag from an “innocent” image is going to result in someone going to prison in America?<p>PhotoDNA has existed for over a decade years doing the same thing with no instances that I have heard of.<p>If some corrupt government wants to get you they don’t need this. They can just unilaterally say you’ve done something bad without evidence and imprisonment you. It happens all the time. It’s even happened in America. Just look up DNA exonerations - people have had DNA on the scene that literally proves their innocence and they’re still locked up.

                    Luckily for me I&#x27;m not an admin on wikipedia, so I don&#x27;t have to decide whose work is notable enough to justify a page. That&#x27;s their problem.<p>And it&#x27;s fine for them to get heat when they make bad decisions, or when people notice that those decisions are systematically biased. I don&#x27;t have to solve the problem to say it&#x27;s bad.
