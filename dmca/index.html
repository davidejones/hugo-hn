<h3 id="reporting-instances-of-copyright-infringement">Reporting Instances of Copyright Infringement:</h3>
<p>If you believe that content residing or accessible on or through the our website (“Services”) infringes a copyright, please send a written notice (by fax or regular mail) to the Designated Agent at the address below.

A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law.
A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is either the copyright owner, or authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.
A signature of the copyright owner, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed.
</code></pre>
<p>After removing material pursuant to a valid DMCA notice, Y Combinator will notify the Subscriber responsible for the allegedly infringing material that it has removed or disabled access to the material. Y Combinator reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate the account of any Subscriber who is the subject of repeated DMCA notifications.</p>

The following statement: &quot;I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.&quot;
