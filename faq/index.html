    <h2 id="hacker-news-faq">Hacker News FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="are-there-rules-about-submissions-and-comments">Are there rules about submissions and comments?</h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a></p>
<h3 id="how-are-stories-ranked">How are stories ranked?</h3>
<p>The basic algorithm divides points by a power of the time since a story was submitted. Comments in comment threads are ranked the same way.</p>
<p>Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software, software which downweights overheated discussions, and moderator intervention.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-a-users-karma-calculated">How is a user&rsquo;s karma calculated?</h3>
<p>Roughly, the number of upvotes on their stories and comments minus the number of downvotes. The numbers don&rsquo;t match up exactly, because some votes aren&rsquo;t counted to prevent abuse.</p>
<h3 id="why-dont-i-see-down-arrows">Why don&rsquo;t I see down arrows?</h3>
<p>There are no down arrows on stories. They appear on comments after users reach a certain karma threshold, but never on direct replies.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-formatting-can-you-use-in-comments">What kind of formatting can you use in comments?</h3>
<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/formatdoc">http://news.ycombinator.com/formatdoc</a></p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-submit-a-question">How do I submit a question?</h3>
<p>Use the submit link in the top bar, and leave the url field blank.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-make-a-link-in-a-question">How do I make a link in a question?</h3>
<p>You can&rsquo;t. This is to prevent people from submitting a link with their comments in a privileged position at the top of the page. If you want to submit a link with comments, just submit it, then add a regular comment.</p>
<h3 id="are-reposts-ok">Are reposts ok?</h3>
<p>If a story has had significant attention in the last year or so, we kill reposts as duplicates. If not, a small number of reposts is ok.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t delete and repost the same story, though. Accounts that do that eventually lose submission privileges.</p>
<h3 id="are-paywalls-ok">Are paywalls ok?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s ok to post stories from sites with paywalls that have workarounds.</p>
<p>In comments, it&rsquo;s ok to ask how to read an article and to help other users do so. But please don&rsquo;t post complaints about paywalls. Those are off topic.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-ask-people-to-upvote-my-submission">Can I ask people to upvote my submission?</h3>
<p>No. Users should vote for a story because it&rsquo;s intellectually interesting, not because someone is promoting it.</p>
<p>When the software detects a voting ring, it penalizes the post. Accounts that vote like this eventually get their votes ignored.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-post-a-job-ad">Can I post a job ad?</h3>
<p>Please do not post job ads as story submissions to HN.</p>
<p>A regular &ldquo;Who Is Hiring?&rdquo; thread appears on the first weekday of each month. Most job ads are welcome there. (But only an account called whoishiring is allowed to submit the thread itself. This prevents a race to post it first.)</p>
<p>The other kind of job ad is reserved for YC-funded startups. These appear on the front page, but are not stories: they have no vote arrows, points, or comments. They begin part-way down, then fall steadily, and only one should be on the front page at a time.</p>
<h3 id="why-cant-i-post-a-comment-to-a-thread">Why can&rsquo;t I post a comment to a thread?</h3>
<p>Threads are closed to new comments after two weeks, or if the submission has been killed by software, moderators, or user flags.</p>
<h2 id="in-my-profile-what-does-showdead-do">In my profile, what does showdead do?</h2>
<p>If you turn it on, you&rsquo;ll see all the stories and comments that have been killed by HN&rsquo;s software, moderators, and user flags.</p>
<h3 id="in-my-profile-what-is-delay">In my profile, what is delay?</h3>
<p>It gives you time to edit your comments before they appear to others. Set it to the number of minutes you&rsquo;d like. The maximum is 10.</p>
<h3 id="in-my-profile-what-is-noprocrast">In my profile, what is noprocrast?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to help you prevent yourself from spending too much time on HN. If you turn it on you&rsquo;ll only be allowed to visit the site for maxvisit minutes at a time, with gaps of minaway minutes in between. The defaults are 20 and 180, which would let you view the site for 20 minutes at a time, and then not allow you back in for 3 hours. You can override noprocrast if you want, in which case your visit clock starts over at zero.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-submit-a-poll">How do I submit a poll?</h3>
<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/newpoll">http://news.ycombinator.com/newpoll</a></p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-reset-my-password">How do I reset my password?</h3>
<p>If you have an email address in your profile, you can request a password reset here. If you haven&rsquo;t, you can create a new account or email <a href="mailto:hn@ycombinator.com">hn@ycombinator.com</a> for help.</p>
<h3 id="my-ip-address-seems-to-be-banned-how-can-i-unban-it">My IP address seems to be banned. How can I unban it?</h3>
<p>If you request many pages too quickly, your IP address might get banned. The self-serve unbanning procedure works most of the time.</p>
