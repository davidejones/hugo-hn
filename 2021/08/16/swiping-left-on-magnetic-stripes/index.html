            Why does it take so long? Where’s the bottleneck?<p>Where I lived over the last years (two countries in Europe), I don’t even have to use the physical card. I just use contactless payments with the phone. Prior to that, it was contactless with card. Even ATMs work with contactless (not all, yet). Prior to that, it was chip. I honestly don’t even recall the time when the magnetic stripe was needed.<p>(edit) Think of this: I made an account with one of these neo banks, ordered the card too, and it took me over a year to activate it. I still don’t use it. I just installed the virtual card into the phone’s wallet and used the account like that.

            <i>Where’s the bottleneck?</i><p>Gas stations. The gas station industry has been avoiding upgrading pumps. It&#x27;s expensive. Retail checkouts usually just need a replacement of the desktop unit, but gas pumps require actual modification. They got a 3-year delay, until October 2020. Then April 17, 2021. Then they got hit by the coronavirus epidemic.<p>The upgrade has to be done by a qualified installer; you don&#x27;t want someone who doesn&#x27;t know what each wire does mucking about with the electrical innards of a gasoline pump. There isn&#x27;t a huge supply of trained gas pump upgraders. There are many pump variations, and some can&#x27;t be upgraded at all. Gas pumps often don&#x27;t have an Internet connection, just a 2-wire twisted pair running RS-422 or something. The chip card readers, inevitably, want full Internet connectivity. Which means getting CAT-5 out to the pump. Which sometimes runs into CAT-5 length limitations. The older systems sometimes worked over dial-up.
Average cost per pump is about $6,000.<p>Gilbarco&#x2F;Veeder-Root has a product which is basically a pair of DSL modems to allow using the existing 2-wire connection to carry the Internet out to the pump.[1] Amusingly, they&#x27;ll give you this for free if you buy their product for running ads on the pump.<p>And, of course, it&#x27;s all &quot;cloud-enabled&quot;.<p>And that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s such a holdup.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RtMxhmJh8V0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RtMxhmJh8V0</a>

            Gas stations also have a disincentive to have you pay at the pump. They want you to walk in and buy from the mini-market, at least here in Australia the petrol was a loss-leader for a long time. They made all their money from the in store mini-market. All petrol stations here are essentially convenience stores with a gas station attached to get you in the door.<p>We have had pay at the pump before, but they got rid of it, and even brand new stations don&#x27;t have it so it&#x27;s not just upgrading the pumps.

            This may be the case in Australia, but it&#x27;s very much not in the US. Pay-at-pump is ubiquitous. Barring outliers like Oregon, people are not used to having to interact with another person or walk away from their cars in the process of filling up their tanks. Gas stations do tend to have colocated convenience stores, but going in one is an optional part of the experience.

            In the US, it&#x27;s much more the norm to start the fuel running, then go inside and buy whatever you need, and come back out to find that your car is full and you can simply drive off. Do Australian pumps not have the little latch to allow fuel to keep running without someone squeezing the handle the entire time?

            Too many stations in my area of the US (western Ohio) allow this. I was a cashier at my family&#x27;s independent gas station for a number of years, and it always pissed off customers when we stopped the dispenser when they walked away &#x2F; got in their car &#x2F; etc. It&#x27;s a legitimate safety and environmental hazard (some hold-open latches don&#x27;t disengage reliably on some filler necks leading to gasoline rolling out of the tank onto the ground). People get used to lax non-safety conscious stations and then act like jerks to the employees in stations who do care.

            Yeah you&#x27;re not allowed to leave the pump running unattended as far as I know, you have to hold down the pump at all gas stations I&#x27;ve been to.

            A lot of gas stations now have a screen on the pump that plays ads at you to make up for the fact that you&#x27;re not coming in. Fortunately there&#x27;s a mute button and it <i>usually</i> works.

            I wonder why there isn&#x27;t a &quot;Buy now&quot; button, they&#x27;re already charging your credit card, they&#x27;d just need to hire someone to run the item from inside the store to you at your car. Add some sensors like body temperature monitoring; Sweating person who looks like they like their sweets? &quot;5% off this ice cream if you hit &#x27;Buy!&#x27; within the next 30 seconds!&quot;.<p>Damn, I think this is an idea.

            This isn’t the case in Tasmania, since nearly nothing is open here 24hrs almost all fuel stations have a pay station located by the building, rather than at each pump.<p>Recently one independent has built a few fuel only prepaid only fuel stops, no minimart and no staff.

            This should be a good incentive for &quot;gas stations&quot; to set up and maintain SAE CCS DC Fast charging for electric vehicles.  Put a couple of small tables and a cafe, and people would stick around for the 30 minutes to get a good charge.

            That was the premise for CHAdeMO. Stop and have a cup of coffee and read the paper in a Starbucks-esque environment. Perhaps even mingle with one&#x27;s fellow man.<p>I don&#x27;t think it will really work outside of very specific demographics who a.) want to get coffee and read the paper&#x2F;rss feeds, and b.) have 30 minutes to spend on a charge-centric event (as in you went there to charge, not to get coffee and croissant).

            In Europe (Scandinavia at least), Gas stations use contactless, and most gas&#x2F;oil companies have a dedicated app (think loyalty card) that can also handle payment for you over the internet.<p>It uses GPS, so when you open the app at a gas station it already knows where you are, and simply asks you which pump you want to unlock.

            I assume they will require an account of some sort, and their DB will inevitably be breached to leak it who knows where. It knows more about me than my location. Probably. I don&#x27;t know what all the proprietary software running on my portable sensor suite does or knows.<p>And almost without fail corporate one-off apps are bloated piles of contracted out and barely maintained garbage taking up too much space when a couple of forms and a few Mb of graphics&#x2F;logos would do. Lastly very few actually work well or reliably, logging me out after needless updates seems to be a common pattern.

            They require an account yes, but don’t kid yourself, every time you use a credit card to purchase something, your habits are being tracked by the merchant, using your very identifiable card number.<p>As for garbage apps, the one I use is well maintained, 53.7 MB binary, so not much on the side of tracking considering it contains ALL of their gas stations with pump details, paid parking lots and car washes. I had to check if it actually used an account, because I don’t remember ever signing in to it.<p>So good apps do exist.

            It&#x27;s probably not a problem in a place like that with some kind of privacy regulation. Import the concept to the US and it&#x27;ll be outsourced to some company with sketchy security that&#x27;ll find all its user data leaked in a year because they&#x27;ll face no social, economic, or legal consequences for not preventing it.

            That’s a great answer. My observation (watching from a card issuer across the pond) has been that it’s also integrated checkout&#x2F;POS infrastructure at a number of large retailers - supermarkets, department stores, pharmacies as well as automated fuel dispensers and ATM†. The USA lagged for probably 15 years before there was any significant penetration of chip + PIN and contactless payments. Once the first large retailer replaced its fleet in ~2017 it’s been accelerating.<p>Since the USA makes up fully half of global card payments, MC and Visa were never going to ditch mag stripe until there was 80% penetration.<p>†Many AFDs seem to be configured to reject international cards which may explain why they’re not well represented in my sample set.

            That&#x27;s interesting, maybe we adopted contactless payments faster in part because in our gas stations you&#x27;d usually pay inside the shop. I have to think that was only one of many reasons, though.

            Well, my 7 years old Mercedes A 180 CDI 2012 model (Diesel engine) averages 53 mpg (4.4 l&#x2F;100Km) still today (see my old comment with all the details for the these numbers at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14552816" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14552816</a>).

            Initially only “credit” networks like Visa&#x2F;MC supported tap to pay with interchange fees of 1 to 2.5%. The low fee debit networks did not. Regulated debit is as cheap as 21c + 0.05%. A lot of retailers have thin profit margins of 5%. So contactless adoption would mean more high interchange “credit” transactions and fewer low interchange debit transactions. Thus the retailer resistance to contactless.

            The USA is a big holdup.  I just traveled across the country and there are still filling (petrol) stations where the only card reader is stripe.  See also other comments about the stripe being a fallback for chip as chip readers on POS terminals seem to be more fragile than magnetic stripe readers.<p>FWIW, Contactless is very hit-or-miss for me in the US; about 1&#x2F;3 the time it just doesn&#x27;t work at all (even with multiple retries), and that&#x27;s when the terminal has one.  Was picking up something at the corner store the other day, realized I didn&#x27;t have my wallet and contactless just didn&#x27;t work with the phone at all for some reason.

How many times have you had this happen?<p>Your groceries are all rung up and the POS terminal is waiting. You dig out your phone or contactless card and try to invoke the contactless payment system. Nothing&#x27;s happening. You wave it around a little. Still nothing. Grocery cashier is looking at you like you&#x27;re an idiot nerd, saying &quot;That thing doesn&#x27;t work. Just stick the card in the slot.&quot; Now I dig in my wallet looking for my chip card as the whole line behind me huffs about how much of a moron I am. Stick it in the POS terminal, and it waits... and waits... and waits... and finally, loudly proclaims BONK BONK BONK transaction approved. Everyone other than me is saying &quot;Finally, we can move on&quot;.<p>Contrast that with mag swipe: Pull out the card. Swipe it (which takes 500ms). Done.

            Coming from Canada: my last experience with the stripe, &gt;3-4 years ago, was more like: pull out the card. Swipe it (it doesn&#x27;t work), Swipe it (it doesn&#x27;t work), Swipe it <i>slowly</i> (it doesn&#x27;t work), wrap a garbage bag around it and Swipe it <i>slowly</i> (it doesn&#x27;t work), Swipe it <i>one last time</i> -- hey, it works! Then, physically sign my name on some piece of paper with a gross pen they had lying around.<p>vs my last 100 contactless payments: pull out the card, tap. Almost instant happy beep.<p>I once actually got stuck at La Guardia because of the chip&#x2F;stripe divide. I hadn&#x27;t thought to get enough US cash out in advance, and all I had was my Canadian CC and Debit cards. I&#x27;d used nothing but the chip on the CC for &gt; a year and didn&#x27;t realize the magnetic stripe was completely worn off!<p>I tried several money-changers and ATMs there, and even called my bank -- <i>no</i> options at all. I finally found $5 CAD in my backpack and changed it to USD for bus fare, then caught a local bus to a nearby <i>actual bank</i>, where they were finally able to use my ID and the card number to authorize an advance. It was a heck of a day.

            Some US chip-enabled ATMs still insist on reading the magstripe first, and then tell you to reinsert if the card tells it that it&#x27;s a chip card. If the ATM doesn&#x27;t swallow your card, you can often swipe ANY chip-enabled card and then insert your preferred card when it tells you to reinsert.

            Here in the UK everywhere accepts chip and contactless. It rarely fails, and when it does everyone assumes its the card reader rather than the card. It&#x27;s common for people to claim they&#x27;ll stop shopping in places where the card readers fail, which means there&#x27;s an incentive for retailers to keep them well maintained.

            I&#x27;ve always suspected they don&#x27;t, but the cab driver says it&#x27;s not working so you pay cash that they don&#x27;t to declare as income in order to minimize their tax liability.

            FYI my understanding is that, in London at least, cabs aren&#x27;t allowed to operated with a broken card reader; if that happens to you, tell them that you have no cash and either it will suddenly magically work or you&#x27;ll get a free ride (this has happened to me).

            When I ask to pay by card in the UK or Norway, it&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50 whether the driver claims the card machine is broken. If you say you don&#x27;t have cash, they&#x27;re like &quot;oh, well, let&#x27;s try just in case&quot;, and lo and behold, it works every time.

            Those exist, but they are somewhat rare overall.  The chip does take a lot longer than it should in most cases (I&#x27;ll give them 2 seconds - which is enough time to cross satellites in geosynchronous orbit, for land based internet connections 50ms is plenty of time).

            All of my cards have the tap to pay symbol, so all I do is tap the card and it works pretty much every time.  If it does not, then I insert it into the chip reader.<p>Since cards can have tap to pay, chip, and stripe all on the same card, I do not see the uncertainty in merchants supporting it to be an Achilles heel since you will have the card anyway.

            It’s not a problem with the tech — just a matter of time and adoption. Swipe cards used to be just as problematic back in the day.  Many places didn’t accept them either, and then if they did, it took a lengthy dial-up connection to process. Sometimes it would fail and retry multiples times, and if it still didn’t work, the cashier would grab one of these out from under the counter: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;I&#x2F;41xAsDSTsXL.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;I&#x2F;41xAsDSTsXL...</a><p>Now <i>those</i> are slow.

            It&#x27;s astounding how slow the rollout is in the US. I&#x27;m 22 and in Australia and I have never used a magnetic strip card and have used the insert chip method less than 10 times.

            Don’t be surprised. The almighty dollar rules here. If they have to pay a dollar to upgrade the infrastructure to support contactless payments, they won’t do it until they absolutely have to. And even then, if there is a payment machine that doesn’t support contactless payments and it is 5 cents cheaper than one that does, they will go with the one that is cheaper. Multiply that by all the hundreds of thousands of different stores. There is a huge national retailer near me that recently replaced all of their sales terminals. I thought that finally I’d be able to use contactless payments. Nope. The new machines don’t accept contactless payments.

            I live in US, use contactless everywhere, and never have this trouble. But I just look for the (standard?) design pattern that indicates contactless is enabled - either text on a screen saying ”… or tap”, or the row of 4 blue LEDs across the top of the reader.

            I can hardly imagine configuring my everyday carry so that a payment card is more accessible than my phone.<p>The latter is like 20 times more frequently used, and I speak as someone who does not use it to pay (at least not directly). Very odd premise, to me.

            I live in the US. This happens to me often. About 50% of my contactless payments fail. The &quot;genius&quot; automatic fraud detection always seems to think it&#x27;s fraud. Why a fraudster would buy $10 worth of fruits at a grocery store next to my listed address, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s not that the terminals are bad. The payment companies use historical data to determine the &quot;right&quot; amount of contactless payments and so we can never really progress.

            The few times contactless has not worked you just put in the same card in the chip slot (why would it be two different cards?).<p>Besides, I don&#x27;t see how your situation is an argument for mag swipe. Are you saying contactless fails more than mag swipes? Or that mag swipe is faster than contactless&#x2F;chip? Absolutely not my experience in either way.

            &gt; Contactless is very hit-or-miss for me in the US; about 1&#x2F;3 the time it just doesn&#x27;t work at all<p>That&#x27;s a shockingly high number. I&#x27;m in Canada, and I&#x27;d take a rough guess that maybe 1-2% of taps fail on first try. Most of the time it works on a second try -- and I actually think that usually happens when the POS system is slow and you tap too early.<p>And in cases where it really is just not working, the fallback is chip + PIN, which is 100% success rate. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s cases where a card gets damaged and it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it&#x27;s not like the magnetic strip will survive that.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used the actual magnetic strip in at least a decade, except when I&#x27;ve been travelling in the US.

            I&#x27;ve come across a few places that accept contactless, but specifically reject Google and Apple Pay, and until recently, none of my cards had contactless built in, so Google Pay was the only way to do contactless. But, I have a Samsung phone with MST, so I can fake a swipe. Amusingly, the terminals that won&#x27;t do contactless Google Pay happily accept the same with the magnetic reader.

            On your point about contact less being hit-or-miss, this very much goes away when you have a number of options for vendors to choose from on the market, with terminals being supplied mainly by banks who want the business. Both competition and a lack of desire to deal with merchants having issues with the payment system provided lead to increases in reliability.<p>The overseas market has been saturated with chips for 10-15 years, and contact less for 5+, probably notably more.

            I have asked in several stores  (in Denmark) where contactless doesn’t work, but the terminal has the required hardware - The merchant has to pay a fee to enable contactless.
My auto mechanic bitched loudly about it, until I told him he wanted $200 for enabling “daytime running lights” in my rear lights, which is also just “flipping a bit”

            I live in Norway, and cannot remember the last time my card wouldn&#x27;t work - period. Not just with the reasons stated.<p>When I lived in the states and worked retail, your cash wouldn&#x27;t be accepted at a lot of stores if the power was out (or if internet&#x2F;phone lines caused the registers to fail). To complicate things, I worked in a pharmacy, so accepting cash for the medicine without it going through the system might have actually been illegal.

            I last had this happen 4 years ago at a pharmacy that was having network issues. But now I no longer have any cards with embossed letters so the imprinting fallback would not longer work for me. I supposed they could fill in the slip manually which seems equivalent to a card-not-present transaction but without the instant confirmation?

            Living in Europe, I genuinely had no idea cards with magnetic stripes were still in use. I thought everything used chips nowadays.<p>I still prefer my card for contactless payments though; using my phone is not really much more convenient since my phone case holds the card anyway and it at least works consistently.

            Or you use contactless payment with your phone which then does not have a 25 EUR limit (actually I think these days it is more like 50 EUR) since the phone supplies some form of authentication, which a plain contactless card can&#x27;t.

            To play devil&#x27;s advocate – who cares? We&#x27;ve had magnetic strips for decades and they work fine. Yes, they&#x27;re insecure but anti-fraud measures taken by the bank can mitigate that. If this helps more stores accept payments without having a painful transition isn&#x27;t that worth it? I use Apple Pay most places but I don&#x27;t mind having to use a strip once in a while or if others do.

            Think about who is paying for that fraud.  Prior to EMV liability shift, Banks paid for the fraud.  After Liability Shift, merchants are paying for fraud using magstripe.<p>Merchants don&#x27;t want to be responsible for the fraud, so they are incentivized to get rid of the mag stripe.

            Depends on the transaction, but merchants can absolutely be liable for fraud before the EMV shift...<p>Also the rate of mag fraud is still pretty low,  more Online Fraud which was ALWAYS liable to the merchant and did not see to do much ti incentivize any changes there.<p>Causing 90% of your customers pain to save less than 1% on fraud is likely going to cost merchants more than just paying for the fraud,  which is also the math online merchants used.  Online merchants that have huge fraud prevention lost more customers than the fraud....<p>Hell I remember one time a online merchant wanted me to submit more info after the sale for anti-fraud...

            The reader may be cheap, but the things its integrated with aren&#x27;t. If it costs $20k to replace a gas pump and you have a half dozen pumps, the cost of replacing them might be comparable to the value of the gas station. A grocery store point of sale system is even more expensive, around $40k a pop. Maybe you&#x27;re lucky and the manufacturer of your current setup has made it in such a way that the card reader can be swapped out without replacing the entire thing, but that&#x27;s a big if.<p>It&#x27;s not like this is an investment that will lead to more customers or new revenue, this is a big expense just to stay afloat. Getting financing for such an expenditure is extremely difficult. At least in a mixed ecosystem you might be able to recoup some of the cost selling your old equipment, but no one&#x27;s going to buy it if it&#x27;s going to stop working soon.

            Even if the machine is physically separated, it still needs to be integrated. At the very least, you need a way of telling the machine what is owed and a method for the machine to communicate back that the amount has been payed, and it can&#x27;t be easily spoofed. Nowadays there is a lot more customer specific integration as well (deals, rebates, signing people up for mailing lists, etc). There are about a dozen different communication standards for POS systems, and some POS systems support more than one, but there are also boatloads of proprietary communications protocols floating around. Presumably you&#x27;re replacing the POS system with one from the same manufacturer, so the communication protocol is likely to be supported, but that doesn&#x27;t mean any custom software you have on your system will run as is.<p>And even if you can hotswap a POS system, they&#x27;re still expensive. A machine plus software is about $4000 per lane, and that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re not a captive market. Even small retailers typically have enough lanes that this is a significant expense. People in this thread are giving prices for Square readers which 1) are not at all sufficient for most businesses and 2) are sold at a loss while Square makes its money on transaction fees and subscription services (the same is true for the rest of the Square clones). It&#x27;s like comparing a home projector to a movie theater projector.

            It is weird that a lot of folks in the thread ignore the very real costs of transition. If there was a nationwide subsidy system for retailers from merchants and banks for fraud reduction en masse, then the transition would be smoother. But since there isn’t it’s partially an iterated prisoner’s dilemma.

            &gt; but anti-fraud measures taken by the bank can mitigate that.<p>Not really. Anti-fraud measures by the banks usually amount to taking the hit themselves, unless they actually catch the culprit. And that&#x27;s only in the case of actual fraud. In other instances, the banks&#x27; algorithm screws up and blocks your card for a legitimate transaction. Then there&#x27;s the hassle of replacing your card.<p>In the U.S., the bank where I have my checking account can print cards in the branch, but many more make you wait for the ever-worsening postal service to deliver you a new one.

            Anti-fraud measures for inherently insecure mag stripe are really tilted in favour of the big operators who can afford a well-skilled fraud shop or a provider who’ll happily charge millions per year in licence fees. The difference in fraud-to-total-dollars-transacted between a big player vs something like a credit union can be 20x, especially if there’s a major counterfeiting campaign. And it’s generally considered a social good not to make things easy for organised crime.

            From the card companies&#x27; perspective, the alternative to magstripe isn&#x27;t contactless, it&#x27;s contact (the smart card IC embedded in the physical card).<p>In the US, the card companies convinced merchants to adopt the EMV contact standard by implementing a liability shift that would make the merchants liable for card-present magstripe fraud after a certain date. For merchants using POS terminals, the liability shift happened in 2015, and for gas stations it happened a few months ago (after several delays). EMV contact coverage needs to be essentially 100% before they&#x27;ll consider getting rid of magstripe completely.<p>Contactless is an entirely optional sideshow, and is not required by anyone anywhere. It has lots of issues (they somehow managed to make it <i>less secure than magstripe</i>(!), which is kind of appaling) and there are no plans to ever have it supersede EMV contact as the baseline standard.

            Contactless is not less secure than magstripe. I don&#x27;t know where you got that from.<p>You can&#x27;t make a fake contactless card, because each card has a private key that you can&#x27;t extract. But it&#x27;s trivial to make a fake magnetic stripe card.<p>One type of fraud with EU credit cards works like this: Criminal collects credit card numbers and pins by adding a hidden magnetic stripe reader to an ATM and a video camera, then create a fake magnetic card, and then withdraw money with fake card + PIN somewhere abroad where magnetic stripes are still allowed.<p>For this reason, my bank disables withdrawals from abroad by default, and you need to manually enable world wide payments in the online banking app.

            You&#x27;re correct that you can&#x27;t easily clone an NFC card from RF interactions alone, but beyond that just about every other aspect of these cards is worse.<p>Most contactless cards can be asked to transmit the cardholder&#x27;s name, credit card number, and expiration date, and the card will happily do so, wirelessly. This is often enough to make fraudulent online transactions.<p>It&#x27;s trivially easy to build a device that does this using a microcontroller and a coil of wire. You don&#x27;t need to have a payment processor&#x27;s encryption key, you can just make one up and the card will reply. You can walk around in a crowded area with such a device and capture responses from hundreds of cards in under an hour.<p>Electronic devices that clone your contactless card are usually better, as they generally require some sort of interaction before they&#x27;ll respond -- actual physical contactless cards might as well be a megaphone attached to your credit card number.<p>If you can capture a genuine transaction between a POS terminal and a contactless card, and if the transaction amount is below the card&#x27;s floor limit, the transaction can often be replayed or relayed to a different terminal.<p>With a cheap amplifier, this can be done reliably from low single digit ft away. The floor limit is usually somewhere around $20-$100 below which the terminal doesn&#x27;t ask for a PIN or go online.

            &gt; You imply that it is possible to clone NFC cards with other means. Is that really possible?<p>I mean, sure, it&#x27;s always possible, but probing a secure microcontroller with needles and an electron microscope isn&#x27;t really what I meant.<p>I was referring to what the various mobile wallet applications do behind the scenes when they allow you to &quot;import&quot; a plastic card and then use it as a contactless payment source via your phone&#x27;s NFC radio. They&#x27;re not <i>actually</i> cloning the private key inside the card, they&#x27;re using various banking APIs to ask for a new key that, for all intents and purposes, will act exactly like the key on the physical card.<p>They&#x27;re supposed to ask for extra info so that they&#x27;re super ultra sure the person importing the card is the legitimate cardholder, but this is not always very thorough. What kind of info do they typically ask for? Numbers printed on the card that you can acquire wirelessly by accidentally bumping into someone. If you&#x27;re lucky, they&#x27;ll try to do two-factor via SMS or email with information that they have on file, but I&#x27;ve seen some that don&#x27;t bother.<p>&gt; Regarding replay attacks, do you have a source on that? I would assume that even offline POS terminals would use a nonce to prevent replay attacks. Is that assumption incorrect?<p>I worked on an EMV contact + contactless implementation several years ago, and at the time contactless replay attacks were easy to demonstrate. Things may have improved since then, but the protocol was not very good (supposedly due to constraints from early NFC cards that were small and anemic), and I think they would need to redo most of it and kill backwards compatibility to mitigate the risk completely.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=e023wGfVaE0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=e023wGfVaE0</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.bham.ac.uk&#x2F;~tpc&#x2F;Relay&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.bham.ac.uk&#x2F;~tpc&#x2F;Relay&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackster.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;this-tiny-10-device-can-perform-nfc-payment-replay-attacks-5486d6ecc405" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackster.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;this-tiny-10-device-can-perform...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;978-3-319-39814-3_8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;978-3-319-39814-3_...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Contactless_payment#Security" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Contactless_payment#Security</a><p>From what I can tell, there was a lot of discourse around these problems around 2015-2018. There were demonstrations and exploits galore. But the standards were already out and none of the banks or card issuers wanted to change anything. Security researchers got bored and moved on. I don&#x27;t see any evidence that replay and relay attack vectors have been fixed, or that they aren&#x27;t exploited in the wild, just that the banks seem to consider the risk acceptable.<p>&gt; And finally, you can extract card holder name and card number from most cards just by looking at them. Claiming that NFC cards are somehow worse than mag stripe cards in that regard is just FUD.<p>So you&#x27;ll let me rifle through your wallet and write down the card numbers and expiration dates? Would the average person let me do this? Of course they wouldn&#x27;t, because basically everybody knows that they need to prevent random people from seeing the various numbers printed on their payment cards.<p>Is the average person aware that I can capture these markings by &quot;accidentally&quot; bumping into their back pocket on the subway?<p>It&#x27;s not FUD, it&#x27;s a (subtly?) different issue, one that the public largely doesn&#x27;t understand yet.<p>What&#x27;s frustrating about contactless cards is that there isn&#x27;t even a good solution once you <i>do</i> understand the problem. Metal shields sewn into your wallet only hide the problem. The card will still respond if you shoot enough energy at it, and you&#x27;ll still be able to pick up the response if you have a sensitive enough receiver.

            Eh? No, it’s part of the EMV standard and uses the same triple-DES crypto. There have been contactless implementations with poor security, including some truly weird contactless-mag stripe devices, but they are not the current standard or widespread in most markets.

            The Pandemic has really changed how credit cards are handled here. Pre-Pandemic, Tap and Pay was fairly rare, but now, it is everywhere (Nearly 90% by my informal count). The odd thing I noticed is that the smaller the market, the more likely the store&#x2F;shop uses Tap and Pay.

            For us ‘Mericans, all credit card transactions at a chip reader are chip+signature. We typically only have PIN numbers configured for debit cards.  And most of those can be processed successfully without providing the PIN by pressing the credit button on the terminal.

            Although, in many cases signatures aren’t necessary. Anecdotally, I can only recall having to sign a handful of times in the last five or so years. (Edit: outside of restaurants.)<p>Also: it’s important to remember that running a debit card as credit isn’t the same thing as using debit. At most banks, your credit limit for debit cards (weird sentence, yeah) is very low: like $500 or so. If you call (and have sufficient funds), they’ll often temporarily raise it for you. (It’s how I paid for school on a debit card when the school could only run it as credit.)

            The holdouts have long been the gas station fuel pumps. Though that is finally changing at least where I am many stations now support chip and tap card payments.

            Gas stations around me (Utah) have all replaced their magstripe with a dual magstripe&#x2F;chip reader. It drives me nuts though, because you still have to insert your card ALL THE WAY IN as if you&#x27;re using the mag stripe, and then it decides which one to use.<p>Are gas stations not a big target for skimmers? Why didn&#x27;t they design it to avoid the magstripe-skimmers? have two inserts or something, I don&#x27;t care. But now we&#x27;re a FULL generation of gas station pumps away from being free&#x27;d from skimmers. I just don&#x27;t understand.<p>Also, don&#x27;t get me started on the audio&#x2F;video ads at the pump these days. They&#x27;re the worst. I&#x27;d rather have to pay inside than have &quot;while you&#x27;re pumping&quot; ads.

            A lot of pumps with the chip readers also have contactless readers, but the on-screen prompts still just say &quot;insert card&quot;.  If your chip card is also contactless, you should be able to just hold it in front of the contactless reader and save both time and wear.

            What I like about the gas station ones, at least where I am, is that they use Zero insertion force contacts instead of brush contacts, so they won’t wear out the connector or your card. You can hear the machine click up and down as it engages.

            This will unlock your phone but not authorize Apple Pay. So the Watch is much more convenient for payments in mask mandate areas. I find it more convenient to tap when unmasked too but that’s more personal preference.

            Yes, but microphobia is more annoying than most viruses, and keeping the immune system unprepared due to lack of exposure is potentially fatal, so perhaps they don&#x27;t want to encourage those...

            The difference is that in Australia literally zero retail businesses will ever accept a cheque under any circumstance and all government payments are made using electronic transfers. I haven&#x27;t been issued a cheque book from my bank in over decade and I&#x27;ve maybe cashed 3 in my 30+ years alive.<p>I actually can&#x27;t think of a single place outside of a bank where you can use a cheque and even then it&#x27;s a challenge to actually exchange it for cash. Most banks in Australia have trouble coming up with $10,000 - even busy branches in the CBD of a major city.<p>Now, granted I haven&#x27;t been to America, but I do read things on the internet. From what I understand, your financial system is held together by a system of pneumatic tubes passing cheques around, though I hear there is some experiment with telegram machines.

            If you want to do it faster, you need government regulation. Magnetic stripes have been phased out in the EU for a couple of years. And additionally online card payments all require 2FA in EU.<p>As a result, there&#x27;s barely any credit card fraud in Europe.<p>You can&#x27;t expect the industry to invest in infrastructure if dealing with fraud is cheaper in the short term. You need to force them.

            Government regulation is what&#x27;s pushing it already. Credit card companies are liable for fraud. Mag stripe has become extremely insecure now that just about anyone can build a reader. So the CC companies are moving to chip and rfid based systems.<p>The bad news is that these new systems are considered so secure that the CC companies have much more limited liability. So that&#x27;s likely to be a problem eventually.

            Still a LOT of merchants that need to upgrade equipment to do chip cards including some large franchises. There is a real problem that chip reading devices do not yet have anywhere near the longevity that magswipe use does. Machines go out of service for repair and cleaning after as little as a month of use in busy locations. Magstripe machines typically lasted 12 months plus before needing attention.

            Who cares about inserting chips into the machine? We&#x27;re already well past that, to contactless payment — tapping the chipped card against the terminal like an NFC door tag. It still <i>uses</i> the chip, and <i>can</i> still require your PIN (depending on your bank); you just don&#x27;t stick the card in the machine to do it. MTBF = approximately forever.<p>Inserting the chip is a fallback, or for high-value transactions. Both use-cases are low-volume enough that a POS terminal&#x27;s chip-slot reader should see relatively little use&#x2F;wear.

            In Finland they motivated the stores to upgrade by telling them that after date X they would be responsible for any fraudulent transactions done with a magstrip.<p>The transition went really fucking fast after that =)

            Where do you live? I haven&#x27;t seen a card terminal that can&#x27;t do chip in like 15 years. The old terminals that need to be upgraded are the ones that can&#x27;t do contactless but even those are rare. A card terminal that can only do magnetic seems really alien and ancient.

            Lot&#x27;s of payment terminals in the UK allow the customer to input the service charge themselves before they enter their PIN. Otherwise the waiter&#x2F;waitress typically asks you how much you want to pay before typing in the amount. If you&#x27;re splitting the bill then they need to do that anyway.

            Here in Canada, portable POS terminals usually have a screen before &quot;TAP&#x2F;INSERT CARD&quot; that says &quot;Add tip?&quot; and offers vendor-set default options, usually either 10%&#x2F;12%&#x2F;15% or 12%&#x2F;15%&#x2F;20%. The fourth option is always &quot;custom&quot;, which allows people to enter 0 if they wish. (There are also payment flows that have an initial &quot;Yes&#x2F;No&quot; on the &quot;Add Tip?&quot; question, in cases where a tip may or may not make sense, e.g. a bakery&#x2F;deli that offers both high-touch dine-in and extremely-low-touch &quot;we just take it from the fridge and give it to you&quot; take-out service.)<p>Since Canada and the US have basically the same tipping culture, these POS systems seem to be already tailored for adoption in the US market (or at least, being cloned by US POS mfgrs.) Not sure why they haven&#x27;t been.

In the US, the way we do tip on receipt is a lot more natural if you&#x27;re asking for a signature. Without a signature, you&#x27;re just handing someone a tip option, which is awkward with our current way of doing things.<p>Most places I go now have a receipt option step that serves as a justification for the tip screen, rather than the signature. Tapping “No Receipt” for a $5 beer purchase is only a little faster and less ridiculous than signing for it.

            For those abroad, even the notion of tipping can be absurd. Using that notion as a point of support for a payment system the levies fraud responsibilities onto the merchant and is very easy to circumvent, and the reason most other places moved to chip+pin, or contactless a long time ago is even more amusing.<p>I understand what you&#x27;re saying, and how its locally relevant, but from the outside looking in the US is a long way behind on keeping up with the tech in this space.

But when you pay, they bring the terminal to your table with the check, then you tell them that you want to add a tip and how much, and they type the total into the terminal before you tap your phone or card.

            When I was over there I constantly got confused around the tipping system and how some bars keep a tab open for you (by take your card and putting it in a little book at the back and then you pay&#x2F;tip at the end)<p>I didn&#x27;t trust that so I ended up just signing the receipt and adding the tip to the bottom and keeping my card in my wallet.

            Signature requirement has gone away in the US (and Mastercard was also the first to do that was well).<p>Just so many merchants are accomplished to asking for it (or haven&#x27;t updated their terminals to code for not asking for it) - which is why you still encounter it.

            They&#x27;re supposed to help you locate fraudulent transactions after your card is stolen. I guess that benefits the merchant because it makes you less likely to mark legitimate transactions as fraudulent.

            No, you can&#x27;t see the signatures, so they don&#x27;t help you locate fraudulent transactions. What they do is provide a defense for the merchant <i>against</i> you. If you try to say you didn&#x27;t authorize the charge, then the merchant can produce the signature as proof that you did. The signature is never evidence that you <i>weren&#x27;t</i> there. Even if it is someone else&#x27;s name, that doesn&#x27;t prove anything, so it never benefits you.

            So most of my current cards (in Europe) have 3 interaction methods:<p>In order of decreasing readability&#x2F;communication reliability:<p>1. Magnetic stripe<p>2. NFC<p>3. EMV<p>The EMV (&quot;chip&quot;) method is the least insecure, but lately all of my cards have been started oxidating. And it seems like the pogo pins in almost all readers also started wearing out too. Chip reader failures have become very common lately.<p>It&#x27;s very common that I have to both clean the card before using it and also bend it while pushing it into the reader to counteract the worn out pogo pins in the in-store reader. Super annoying.<p>NFC has been a saver, but because of the banks security risk (it&#x27;s cleartext, after all) you can&#x27;t really use it all of the time.<p>The magnetic stripe seems like it never seems to stop working. I&#x27;ve assumed I can&#x27;t use it outside of my native country, though, perhaps incorrectly.

            Almost all NFC you find these days is going to be a form of EMV and is encrypted.<p>There was a form of contactless magstripe (MSD) that was not encrypted and has been phased out of usage as of like, late 2019 via card update bulletins.

            I think the magstripe is disabled in my region, I&#x27;ve never managed to use it on any of my cards. I tried testing it out to see if it even was functional. Surely they must work as I&#x27;ve heard quite a few stories of card skimmers...

            There is definitely a card number on the magstripe on it, but i think you cannot make a transaction with it in the SEPA region.  So you need to &quot;clone&quot; that card and make a transaction with it in a non SEPA region country and that is disabled by default on debit cards (not credit cards though).

            Banks can reject magstripe use when it knows both the card and the card reader should have chip support.<p>I believe this is to help discourage downgrade attacks.

            This might sound like a stretch, but I wish I could just pay without having my phone or card or cash or anything else on me. In general I&#x27;m growing weary of authentication hell, but specifically with how it all seems to come back to requiring my phone. I really wouldn&#x27;t mind just keying in my account number and pin to make a payment, but of course that&#x27;s just username + password and I suppose unacceptably risky. The solution I expect is for Amazon to recognized my face and bill me.

            I&#x27;m pretty sure the magstripe is already somewhat disabled over here. My debit mastercard refuses to work outside of the European union unless I disable the geo locking in the banking app, and when my chip was broken the readers kept telling me to put the chip in.

            That’s just a bit on the mag strip that encodes if your card has a chip present.<p>You can flip it with a writer and use the magnet strip again if you want.<p>It’s quicker as one doesn’t have to wait for the Javacard OS on the chip to boot up and handshake. (Ie swipe and walk away vs insert, wait 4 seconds, remove).<p>Wouldn’t do this on my debit card but it’s fine on credit cards with chargeback protection.

            Isn&#x27;t that going to lead to the transaction being denied, either by the bank (which knows there&#x27;s a chip), or even the reader (does it know that all cards beginning WXYZ have chips, for example?)?

            Online transactions can be secured by solutions like 3D Secure. In the european union for european countries such solutions are already required for dome transactions. But US companies hesitate to enforce them as they make buying less convenient but much more secure. Or the CCV printed at the back of a credit card, this is impossible for bank cards in europe. But mastercard and visa prefer the convenient approach.<p>It would be a nice if one of the new fintech startups added the option in the account settings to enforce 3D Secure for all online transactions.

            &gt; Prepaid cards in the U.S. and Canada are currently exempt from this change.<p>I&#x27;m telling you all, prepaid cards are a scam. Why? One of the reasons besides massive fees and shady tactics for most are because they&#x27;re so far behind the times. Most don&#x27;t even have a chip for example. Look at a Netspend card (using it as a prime example) and compare it to any bank card today.

            Why wouldn’t everywhere be supporting contactless payments by this point?<p>And that’s not me being snippy, because perplexingly, Mariano’s, a grocery store chain in Chicago owned by Kroger’s, does <i>not</i> support NFC payments. (I assume Kroger’s stores proper don’t either.) You have to swipe, use the chip, or use the dedicated Kroger Pay app to scan a QR code to use your digital wallet. <i>(Yes, really. Took them forever to even support chips instead of magstripes.)</i><p>I have absolutely no idea why they do this. Is there a higher interchange fee for contactless? Kroger’s isn’t some mom-and-pop convenience store—they’re the largest supermarket company by revenue.

            I&#x27;ve been shopping at Kroger regularly for decades and my guess is that it might have something to do with the timing around their last major payment terminal upgrade. They upgraded before NFC payments were very popular but fairly close to when they really needed to support chip cards (my recollection was that the payment networks were saying they would no longer insure against fraud without a chip terminal), and it seems like for whatever reason they went with a terminal that didn&#x27;t support it.<p>I remember being annoyed with seeing all of the seemingly brand-new hardware being installed at multiple locations that very obviously lacked NFC payment support.

            Kroger brand stores have terminals that support contactless. Their self checkout lanes get new hardware and&#x2F;or software every couple of years.<p>I’ve worked with many payment gateways over the years and enabling contactless on a stack that already did EMV never required a code change on the POS system. The terminal just passes the same data along to the POS.<p>I’m convinced there’s some fees at play here. The standout to me is how they push Kroger Pay - that’s to save on processing fees.

            They did swap out all of the payment terminals, though. Just for ones without that functionality. However, I could believe that they selected the hardware because they were stuck with choices that were compatible with other systems. Kroger is a big company with quite a lot of resources, though.

            The QFC (which is Kroger&#x27;s AFAIK) near me finally started allowing NFC payments sometime in 2020. Part of me wonders if covid and wanting less contact motivated that because the actual terminals themselves didn&#x27;t change but rather they just enabled the NFC functionality.

            Even in the US, I can&#x27;t remember when I last had to use the magstrip. [1] I could probabbly degauss the magnetic strip and not have any issues. If you have a chip debit card that you never use... it probably isn&#x27;t a bad idea to make the card chip only.<p>What I actually want is a specific bank alert if the card is used without the chip. Currently I just make any transaction over $20 send an email.<p>[1] I guess at resturants where they actually take the card for a minute, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s chip or magstrip transaction.

            One thing I&#x27;ve been curious about is how long have ATMs been using chip readers? Do they use NFC readers now? The ATMs I&#x27;ve used all still pull they card in and dispense it, so you can&#x27;t really see what technology they&#x27;re using internally.

            I sometimes keep my credit card near my iPhone. I have wondered about the impact on credit cards of the new MagSafe magnets in iPhones. I guess if there aren&#x27;t magnetic strips anymore, I won&#x27;t have to worry about it. OTOH, there won&#x27;t be any backup if the chip doesn&#x27;t work, which it doesn&#x27;t always.

            There are some in the U.S. that do this, but it still didn&#x27;t stop my friend from leaving his card in the ATM and having to go through a process with the bank and wait for a new card to show.

            I have never, ever heard someone saying they forgot their card in the handfuls of European countries where I have been. I have heard complaints about the ATM &quot;eating&quot; the card (not restituting it; this happens sometimes for various reasons). You&#x27;d have to try very hard to do it (like take the card out, because otherwise you won&#x27;t get any cash, and then sticking it back in, or just leaving without taking either cash or card). This just is not a problem.

            I&#x27;ve been exclusively using the chip in my Credit and Debit Cards for at least a decade - every transaction works, every time for the life of the card. I&#x27;ve used them from Botswana to Egypt to Morocco to Canada through Central and South America and Australia.<p>They work perfectly.

            Contactless works pretty well in my experience and doesn’t put any physical wear on the card.  There’s a couple big retailers still holding out, but most places I go seem to have it enabled these days.

            I&#x27;d prefer we just phase out MasterCard. I went to a restaurant the other day. QR code on the receipt. Scan that and it opens up Toast. Toast then connects to Apple Pay, which then connects to my credit card. No less than 3 middlemen to pay the restaurant, is absurd.<p>QRCode -&gt; Wallet on my phone holding stablecoin on a L2 like polygon (which is collecting APY through DeFi) -&gt; Restaurant

            While your point is valid regarding a crazy number of middlemen, I&#x27;ve also paid via the QR code on the receipt at a number of restaurants recently and I love it!
No need to flag down a server when it&#x27;s time to pay; I just scan it on my phone, click on apple pay, enter the tip, and I&#x27;m done!

            Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love it too. I didn&#x27;t suggest getting rid of the QR code, just the backend flow of middlemen taking fees from the restaurant.

            Hello Strawman.<p>Does anyone actually pay the way you described? Honestly?<p>I either swipe my card or hand it to them to do it for me and call it a day.<p>I don&#x27;t have to worry about some cryptojockey screwing up a DeFi contract scheme and all my money being stolen in a non-FDIC insured account. I have fraud protections against card theft.<p>It ain&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s not the electronic equivalent of walking around with me lucky charms in my fanny pack, ripe for the mugging, either.
