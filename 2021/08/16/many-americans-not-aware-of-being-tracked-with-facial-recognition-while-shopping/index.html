            One other thing people may not realize. If you use your credit card at a merchant online or in person and you associate any information such as a telephone number or email with that card. Any time you use that card, online or off, to make a purchase with that merchant those transactions can be tied together regardless of whether you provide your email&#x2F;phone on future transactions. Large vendors such as walmart etc now associate that phone&#x2F;email and card(s) with your facial recognition information. The second you walk into the store based on your face they can pull up your entire purchase history and contact. They are now crunching that data to improve retail layouts, marketing pitches, etc and there is growing market of selling aggregates of that data across merchants.

            Then why does it take the sales person at Macy&#x27;s 15 minutes to look up my order before giving up and just giving me a refund for a poorly fitting sweater I brought back?

            I think the ultimate cause of this kind of inconsistency is that the panopticon-style correlation of customer data is happening offline in a business intelligence system that has a one-way, stale data feed from various ETLs, while making a return happens in an online system that doesn&#x27;t get anything back from the analytics system (because the analytics data is too loosely structured and low-quality to feed it back into a line of business system).<p>This kind of dichotomy exists in just about any organization that gets into BI&#x2F;data science&#x2F;whatever you want to call it, and it can be absolutely maddening. The state of ETLs and analytics systems, for example, means that we have basically gone back to &quot;overnight batch processing&quot; and a lot of reporting data only becomes available the day after the transaction, since all the ETLs need to run and then whatever analytics system, data-cube assembly or etc. But since the analytics system <i>exists,</i> it is taken as good enough and no one wants to re-implement the functionality in an online, system-of-record fashion.<p>Or another way to put it: the GP says &quot;The second you walk into the store based on your face they can pull up your entire purchase history and contact.&quot; That&#x27;s being pretty generous... most of the time they don&#x27;t know any of that until an hour or a day later, because it comes from multiple disparate systems (and outside vendors) and importing that data into a data warehouse (in batches) and then correlating it later is <i>far</i> easier to implement, and the dominant method used in this kind of analytics.

            Customer support is a cost center, so it gets less funding than sales&#x2F;marketing-oriented projects<p>(route-optimizing here likely has the intention of boosting sales, not necessarily reducing customer shopping time)

            Yes. There’s a reason some of the most often needed groceries are almost always at the back of a supermarket.

        <div class="body">
            Yes, because that&#x27;s where the refrigerated warehouse is usually located: in the back of the store, to make it easier and cheaper to restock shelves from behind. By comparison, at least in the US, green groceries are almost never in the back of the store.

            I don&#x27;t understand &quot;cost center&quot;. Everything is a cost center except the part where you physically acquire the money. Surely both marketing and customer service are invested money that hopefully increases your customer base down the line? What&#x27;s the difference?<p>I suspect the real reason that the panopticon is kept separate from the customer is to avoid creeping people out.

            Is it? That&#x27;s 15 minutes of a customer <i>not</i> spending money, and 15 minutes of a staff person dedicated to <i>giving back money</i> to a customer, rather than generating more revenue.<p>I get that its considered a feature to get them into a store, but surely you don&#x27;t want to optimise for associates not selling things?

Waiting in a boring line means eyes that wander to adjacent displays and stands.

            Why improve the service when you make purchases anyway? No unnecessary optimizations. Aggregated data is valuable and it is sold to any other industry. Helps with the slim margins of retail. They also get more pictures of you.

            I don&#x27;t know if this actually makes things better or worse - I do it in the hope I can shut down spam by removing a compromised address - but I try very hard to use a different email address for every business I purchase from.<p>You don&#x27;t always have to provide a phone number, either. Most of the time yes, but I don&#x27;t think the phone number is actually required to complete a credit card transaction.<p>There also used to be credit providers - maybe there still are? - that would let you generate a new card number for each purchase. That too may accomplish nothing from a tracking perspective, since the credit provider would be able to match up all the numbers. But, if I had that capability, I would use it.

            Bank of America stopped doing virtual credit card numbers a few years ago.<p>I think Citibank allows you to do it, but I have no personal experience or knowledge.<p>I have a card from Capital One that allows virtual credit card numbers.<p>Privacy.com is a service specifically for this issue.  It allows you to generate lots of virtual cards and even use fake names so you can&#x27;t be tracked so easily.

            Obviously you can&#x27;t but the point people don&#x27;t realize is that if you use that same card in store the merchant can link it back to online purchases you made and all your information which they can then package and sell to data brokers.

            This to me is part of a general trend wherein only those with the awareness and resources required will have privacy.<p>For example, if you do have the funds, send a private shopper.

            The industrial revolution divided the world into those who had capital (owned factories, tools, land, etc.) and those who produced labor (worked in the factories, used the tools, worked the land, etc.). Those on the side of labor couldn&#x27;t provide value without access to capital where it could be used. Conversely, those with capital need labor to extract value from it. The factories don&#x27;t run themselves.<p>In theory, this would balance out and lead towards some level of equality. In practice, the high barrier of entrance and smaller numbers on the side of capital made it much easier for them to drive down labor prices and exploit. That led to massive inequality—think robber barons and the like—which in turn eventually led to the organized labor movement.<p>We are now recapitulating this historic arc in the information revolution. Now the world is divided into those who own data and those who produce it. Large corporations own giant fields of data and the computing technology required to derive actionable information from it. Everyone else gives up their personal data and attention to feed those enormous machines. This has led to the growing inequality that is causing a breakdown in institutional trust and is driving people out of cities that are increasingly affordable only to the elites who run the data factories.<p>At some point, we will hopefully have an &quot;organized data movement&quot; where people work together to be able to make effective demands about how their data can be harvested and used. We aren&#x27;t there yet.

The world was divided long before the Industrial Revolution, and if &quot;labor&quot; was ever on top of things, it was for fleeting moments. What changed with the Industrial Revolution was the collection of economic power in the hands of a mere titan of industry — instead of some baron, or prince, or caesar, or warlord, or chieftan, or other political personage.

            Very true. We are witnessing how a new aristocracy is being built. This time it’s not based on skills in warfare but around business skills. But the result is the same: you have a small group who thinks they are better than others and deserve to receive the vast majority of the profits society creates. And they manipulate the game to their advantage.<p>This seems to happen in all societies until a revolution happens and the cycle starts anew just with different actors.

            We are going though iterations of societies&#x2F;empires&#x2F;cultures. Each round has the same issues but we get to learn from- and bring solutions from the previous one. The collective is much stronger than influential individuals but there has to be a collective will to change the game. It seems to me that we are more humanitarian than many previous cycles but I&#x27;m afraid we wont show much of an interest in [epic] game design until things get truly terrible. (Cheran pops to mind: That Mexican town of 16k that got rid of police, politicians and mobsters)<p>This time we did get game design down to an art with fine mechanics and cheap execution. Perhaps someone with a sharp pen can draw the parallels for us. Surely (if the will is there) it is easy to design something better than the stupid formula where we pretend Personal gain = Collective gain.

            &gt; The division happened when transitioning from hunter gatherers (which didn&#x27;t need possessions, just hard work)<p>I am sure hunter gatherer societies were also very territorial. If the area you are hunting or gathering does doesn’t have much animals or plants, all the hard work won’t get you nearly as much food as someone who has a lot of plants and animals on their land.<p>And if you don’t think early humans were territorial just take a look at chimpanzees or even lions. Being tribal and territorial goes back a long ways.

            This may actually close the class divide a little.<p>The thing with privacy is the more wealthy you are, the more valuable it is. For example, if I want to sell something, I will want to target the wealthiest first. Same thing for scammers, and newspapers will follow celebrities. Who care about the poor, there is no money to extract from them.<p>So let&#x27;s get back to the private shopper. A rich and famous man will want to hire a private shopper, because he knows that if he is found in a shop, he will be bothered by people who are after his money and fame. His privacy is worth a lot, to him and to others.<p>The private shopper is likely to be of a more modest status, he can go shopping without being bothered, he may be tracked by robots and end up with personalized ads, be part of some statistics, whatever, but no one will stop him for an autograph or some special favor.<p>So when the rich man pays the private shopper, with a little extra for his discretion, that&#x27;s resources that go from the wealthy to the &quot;rest of us&quot;.<p>The same can be said for loyalty cards. The one who can afford not to use loyalty card will earn the shop more profit (because no discount), meaning that it can offer bigger discounts to others.<p>It is as if a unit of privacy is proportional to your wealth. The amount of privacy a rich man will get by paying $1000, a poor man can get it for $1. In the same way that it is much cheaper to secure a penny than a gold bar, because no one will want to steal your penny.

            &gt; The one who can afford not to use loyalty card will earn the shop more profit (because no discount), meaning that it can offer bigger discounts to others.<p>I don&#x27;t use loyalty cards, but I don&#x27;t pay more because of it. There still exist stores that don&#x27;t have them, and my observation is that the regular prices on those stores are about the same as the &quot;loyalty card discount&quot; price at other stores.<p>The &quot;discount&quot; you&#x27;re getting with a loyalty card is a sham. The regular prices were just bumped up to give the illusion of a discount.<p>More to the point, though, the issue I see with your analysis is that you&#x27;re assuming that privacy has a single value. My privacy is worth just as much to me as a wealthy person&#x27;s privacy is to them. That others value them differently is unimportant. The cost of the loss of that privacy is the same regardless of income, but only the wealthy have a way to minimize that loss without going to extreme measures.

            Many of the stores I&#x27;ve been to give the cashiers a &quot;store&quot; card that they just swipe if you don&#x27;t have one (even if you&#x27;ve never signed up.) It probably violates some corporate policy but they seem to get away with it.

Thats not how this works.<p>The rich man is paying a private shopper to use the PS&#x27;s face in the facial recognition system and card tracking system. the PS gets the ads, but not the rich man. The rich man&#x27;s habits are still tracked (by proxy, assuming PS doesn&#x27;t shop personally at same store). At best, the rich man gets his habits co-mingled with PS to get slightly higher anonymity.<p>&gt; The same can be said for loyalty cards.

My credit card offers discount to those who spend 10k+ on private jets presumably because those people outspend enough to justify the cost

            It&#x27;s called price segmentation. Make the same product available at multiple price tiers, but make the lower prices more time consuming and difficult to get. Clip a coupon, file a rebate, join a club. Then you get the best of both worlds, you extract a maximum price from well to do shoppers but have an optional price that still attracts the bargain hunters.

            Often same product with a different price sits on the same shelf in a supermarket. Some (most, in fact) people will buy a costlier version, because they can afford to pay more for (perceived) better quality.

            &gt; But an even more direct example is skipping the discounts associated with club cards for privacy reasons.<p>Right, but most still pay with a credit&#x2F;debit card when checking out which gives the cc&#x2F;bank the same info.

            I bet if I asked the people I know (many who earn enough to not need the discounts) if they would rather spend 1% less on their groceries and let go of their grocery purchase data, or if they would spend 1% more and keep their purchase history private, almost everyone would choose to voluntarily give it up and spend 1% less.

            I&#x27;m guessing this is why many grocery stores don&#x27;t allow NFC payments, except for (in my area at least) Safeway, whose non-club pricing is so punitive that most people just knuckle under and get the card.<p>Though I just use 867-5309 anyway.  Works in every area code, AFAICT.

            I know it&#x27;s not exactly a last name, but... did you try the &quot;standard&quot; name for that number? I can&#x27;t imagine nobody else thought of signing up like that, so unless the store explicitly blacklisted certain numbers, I&#x27;d think it worth a shot.

            I don&#x27;t see the inherent dilemma without establishing the impact towards quality of life. The price of yachts also entrenches this same divide but I hardly care since my access to yahts isn&#x27;t a big concern. In the same manner, the only people whose QoL suffers from this sort of disparity seems to be activists and the people who buy into their fearmongering. Where&#x27;s the real damage?

            I believe even with resources it won’t be possible to evade that.
Gait recognition can even recognize a person that pretends to walk like a different person or being hurt - at least that is what I heard last time about this technology.

            In many ways it’s a prisoners dilemma problem. We can contrive many particular cases where your individual data might put you at risk, but the fundamental problem is that broadly having access to many people’s data allows the people who hold that data to do analysis on it and to have enormous levels of control over the population because they can carefully tune their actions and messaging based on that data.<p>Ultimately your individual data is far less important than the aggregate data for making these decisions- and you are impacted regardless of whether your personal data is available or not.<p>The question is whether or not we could get people to collectively act in their own self interest and push back against data collection.  Based on what we’ve seen over the last 2 years with the pandemic I have absolutely no hope for humanity ever being able to collectively act in its self interest and the road to hell will be paved with people asking “how does it hurt me, personally, right now”.

            People will judge you using anything they can get their hands on. Looking at your nutritional choices I might think you are not investment material, worth hiring, worth giving a lone to. But then I can also use it to judge your friends, relatives and your great great great grandchildren.<p>You might have friends over every weekend but those 4 crates of beer also put you on the alcoholics list. +1 alcoholics for your contact list. And you purchased helium for that kids party. A pack of smokes for the gardener per week. You look 62% like a person on the crack cocaine list and 59% like a regular weed customer. Those are over 50% are they not? Seems good enough to use.<p>Eventually you get to the &quot;people who are not racists but are unsure if their clients are - so you are not hired&quot; kind of situation. How many alcoholics who suck helium, do crack and smoke pot can you &quot;seriously&quot; have in your network?<p>These are most likely stupid examples but that makes them good. We have no idea how the data will be used when combined with other data. Someone will think of something way more stupid.

            I wonder this too, but perhaps your insurance company buys this data on you and says, oh, they drink sugary drinks and eat candy and chips. They are buying Tylenol and ibuprofen for chronic pain. Maybe they will get diabetes and we should raise their premiums accordingly.

            Insurance companies DO buy data like this. It is not perhaps. They buy data about you that they do not use to your advantage. They have no interest in lowering your premiums and every interest in raising them.<p>One other example is the 2016 election and cambridge analytica. Not going to make a political case on the politicians, but the political parties (and foreign govs with interest in the outcome) bought data on electors to try and persuade them to vote for one candidate or the other. Or to make them think issue X is bigger deal than they previously did. People don&#x27;t like to lose autonomy in politics and data is good for targeting and persuasion.<p>Of course, the big what-if is also worrisome. Maybe not to you, but to many. Some people are more concerned than others. If your of one minority religion, then you might worry if that religion gets targeted will gov buy data to identify individuals (eg china and Uyghurs or trump and his proposed list of muslums). Maybe your gay in a nation that isn&#x27;t friendly to that. Its very easy to tell if someone is queer from mass collected data. That could be a concern if the gov starts looking for people.<p>Another less scary but not great what-if: Many govs (including some us govs) are doing more &quot;pro-active policing&quot; where they try to prevent crimes, often with biased data. Right now its pretty targeted at going to minority neighborhoods, but maybe one day it&#x27;ll target underage people who buy alcohol paraphernalia to see if they drink underage. Minor crime oft-committed, but probably easy to identify from only grocery store purchase data - especially if you combine that with camera data (walk in&#x2F;out with someone who buys booze while they buy solo cups). While the under-age drinking is a silly example, it uses pretty easily available data. Think of all the minor crimes people knowingly commit that no one actually cares to enforce. Now imagine what we could do if a computer can just spit out a list of names.<p>There are so many ways the data can be (ab)used and people come up with more every day.

            &gt; If insurers couldn&#x27;t price accurately then insurance as a business couldn&#x27;t exist.<p>Or they can totally stop pricing people reasonably at all. Insurance is predicated on sharing the risk. If &quot;risky&quot; people get priced out of driving (especially based on things they can&#x27;t reasonably control!) then its probably bad for society.<p>This is even more true for medical insurance (although laws are probably stronger here). That said, i personally think the government (in us) should be handling medical costs on some level so maybe my opinion on controlling capitalism w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t medical insurance isn&#x27;t the market-driven.

Wrong as in completely crazy and unreasonably wrong, which might be difficult to imagine, but think about what&#x27;s currently happening in Afghanistan - rebels have now taken over the country and can do as they wish, and I bet they would be happy to use past purchase data to retroactively punish people who bought the &quot;wrong&quot; things in the past if such data collection systems were in use there.

            Others have mentioned specific reasons, but another aspect to consider is that once you&#x27;ve given up any kind of data, it&#x27;s out of your hands.

            Maybe it&#x27;s not a slam dunk, but it&#x27;s something that should at least pass through your mind when making these decisions, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case for a lot of people.<p>Does being able to deploy this argument in more situations suggest that it&#x27;s a bad argument?<p>As for what happens if sharing X actually helps you in the future, you always have that option. Not sharing initially doesn&#x27;t stop you from sharing later. Sharing initially does stop you from not-sharing later, if that makes sense.

            Purchasing history is some of the most personal and sensitive data there is about you. It can reveal nearly everything.<p>But, ignoring that, there&#x27;s a very good reason why you might want to keep as much data out of the machine as possible -- even data that, on its own, is of no importance. That reason is databases. The data you provide to any business will be combined with the data you&#x27;ve provided everywhere else. All of those items that on their own are of no importance become incredibly intrusive and privacy-destroying when combined with each other.

            &gt; But so what, what is the end game here?<p>Police obviously love this data, and when its being traded in open market it is sold without a warrant. Laws change, if your a minority or in an oppressive country, data is scary.<p>In real terms for most white americans who don&#x27;t break laws, the &quot;slippery slope&quot; (or shifting baseline) is already getting bad for end users. ..<p>I interviewed for a job at an insurance company. They said they offer a car plug in that tracks your car (to know if you&#x27;re risky driver) to &quot;offer discounts on good driving&quot;. They said in interview (not publicly) about 4% of people get discounts and the rest stay the same or go up. They gets tons of data on how people drive to tune their models. They also said that some neighborhoods are now considered more dangerous because they saw <i>other drivers</i> in their data being dangerous. Basically you now pay more because they know you live near other bad drivers, or bad drivers go to the grocery store near you, or whatever.<p>They also said (in 2018) they are working on an app to show you an id card (and track you in your car if you don&#x27;t want their dongle). They&#x27;re very interested in data on where you go and how you use your car, for obvious reasons.<p>I don&#x27;t know if they do this, but they could easily buy data on where you shop to determine if the path from your home to the store has dangerous intersections that might raise your premiums. That is an easy use for grocery store data that will have clear downsides to most people.

            The October before covid me and Mrs. Asciimov went on a cruse with Royal Caribbean.  We got dropped off at the port, put our luggage in the loading area, and proceeded to walk inside, all without talking to anyone.<p>Not 30 seconds after walking into the Port Building, a RCL rep walked up and greeted me and the mrs by first name. Said please walk this way, I have you all checked in, you just need to go through the returning voyagers boarding line. (metal detector&#x2F;contraband check)<p>To be honest it was both creepy to have them just know who I was, and kinda awesome to get to skip the regular check in step. I asked the lady how she knew who we were, she told us that between the cameras in the port and the photos we submitted during the cruise purchase they knew who we where, and the information pops up on their tablet when they are assigned the next customer.

            Yeah, you have to send them a picture of yourself when you sign up, like you do for a passport or a drivers license.<p>It gets attached to your account and when you get on the boat you are given an ID card to use to make onboard purchases and to disembark from the boat. Every time you leave or get on the boat they make sure the photo on your account matches who you say you are.

            Kroger has felt especially intrusive for a couple of decades; it&#x27;s almost as though they&#x27;re going out of their way to be manipulative and creepy, right from the store layout where Pepsi is $87.00 at your feet and Coke is $0.75 at eye level, down to the personalized coupons they send you in the mail.  But the big stores that don&#x27;t have loyalty cards are still slurping up data; they just get it from your credit card and their cameras.  I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, beyond just trying to frequent farmers&#x27; markets.

            I hate the idea of facial recognition tech being used like this but I really don’t mind loyalty cards&#x2F;using credit cards to track spending as long as the data is only used by the stores themselves (and not also sold wholesale to the highest bidders, which I bet it is).<p>I think it’s fair for them to gather analytics on spending habits and use it to make decisions on how to stock their store, run promotions, etc. Same for personalized coupons. Feels weird, but is pretty harmless, and I’m pretty sure they’re just trying to get you to try new things (like for me, beyond meat) so you start regularly purchasing it.

            You buy a pregnancy test and pre-natal vitamins. This information is sold and put together as part of a “profile”. Your employer buys these profiles, sees you’re pregnant and fires you because who wants to deal with maternity or paternity leave. You never told them you were pregnant, they can claim they didn’t know.

            Home Depot lost over 50 million debit and credit cards. Linking your first and last name with your payment method &#x2F; methods and submitting it to companies not known for their security may not be in your best (long-term) interest. Doubly so considering many company account forms have address as well - meaning anyone with access is very close to having everything required to open a bank account in your name.<p>You&#x27;re not wrong though; arguments against loyalty cards are seemingly random chains of chance, and the information is being sold by Visa as well anyways. So I&#x27;m not surprised by the free market, laissez-faire ideals on display. I don&#x27;t have my eyes on perfection, just on minimizing how many times I give out potentially damaging information. And if some other people start to push back as well? Well, the more the merrier.

            I wonder if there&#x27;s a Winco or local equivalent for you?   They don&#x27;t accept credit cards, only debit cards, checks, and cash.  No loyalty programs.   And you have to bag your own groceries.   I switched from using a debit card to cash just because I like the idea that I&#x27;m not being tracked at all.<p>WinCo Foods, Inc. is a privately held, majority employee-owned[5][6][7] American supermarket chain based in Boise, Idaho, with retail stores in Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas,[8] Utah, and Washington. It was founded in 1967 as a no-frills warehouse-style store with low prices.

            Use the scooters they provide for mobility-impaired people.<p>Note you shouldn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> do this because you&#x27;re taking away a scarce resource that might actually be needed by other people who can&#x27;t walk, but it would defeat gait recognition. You can always bring your own scooter, but you&#x27;d have to bring a different one every time or you could be identified by the scooter. Since that would get quite expensive, you might need to pool resources with other privacy-minded individuals to maintain a shared group of scooters.

            In Canada, &#x27;price discrimination&#x27; is a criminal offence. Cuz you know, if something is anti-consumer and impacts rich people, strong laws will be written against it.<p>But there&#x27;s many ways around it.

            It needn&#x27;t even be price discrimination; for example, they can also just specifically highlight discounts for you for products that you usually combine with expensive&#x2F;high-margin products that you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t buy.

            Would it work if the computer I have is not always turned on? I think the other MTAs would give up delivery after a few retries, so you need at least one always-on computer, so a server. And then we&#x27;re not really in the &quot;free&quot; territory anymore, it&#x27;s much more worth it to just pay professionals for hosting.

            Exactly. It doesn&#x27;t lower prices. What it really does is increases profits, which allows them to grow <i>faster</i> than local markets and they can expand and wipe out even more groceries and ends up as a big fat bonus for the executives and shareholders.

            If fewer people shoplift, the shrinkage rate lowers and grocery stores have more room to play with the price because their margin is wider. This is why inner city stores with higher shrinkage rates charge higher prices and why memberships stores like Costco which have almost no shoplifting losses at all can be so competitive.<p>If facial recognition is able to reduce theft, prices will likely be competed downwards over time.

            I feel like this misunderstands sales and discounting systems. Because it&#x27;s a snappy line which is technically true but the long answer is way weirder.<p>I&#x27;m just gonna use Kroger as an example because they use &quot;club pricing&quot;, rotating club pricing, actual sales, &quot;manager specials&quot;, and closeout sales.<p>- Everything by default is priced at MSRP, that&#x27;s the price on the white price tags or the yellow price tags that don&#x27;t have a corresponding white price.<p>- Then they use club pricing which is the price on the &quot;yellow&quot; tags that aren&#x27;t formatted like number&#x2F;$dollars like 3&#x2F;$5 or 2&#x2F;$4. This is the price you would compare to Walmart.<p>- Then there is rolling club pricing which is like 2&#x2F;$5 but always unit priced to your benefit. So they will mark 2&#x2F;$4 but the unit price is $2.<p>These aren&#x27;t actually sales in any meaningful sense. But the next ones are.<p>- The actual sales require a minimum unit purchase. You probably see these when buying soda or vitamins. If you compare prices to other stores this is only time you&#x27;ll see the unit price actually smaller than other stores. The &quot;buy n get $n&quot; deals are also in this category but are way more gameified.<p>- Then there are &quot;manager specials&quot; i.e. &quot;woohoo!&quot; deals which are priced with stickers and also actually discounts.<p>- Finally there are closeout deals which are white tags usually steeply discounted and don&#x27;t require a card to get.<p>I really hate that all this garbage works. I really appreciate stores that just post a price.

            In my experience, this is not a general Walmart policy, it is store-specific.  Not too long ago I was looking for a product that only Walmart seems to keep in stock, but they don&#x27;t keep much of it.  And their online system is not very accurate.  So in the space of two hours I visited four different Walmarts, ranging from one in a nicer area of town, to one in a poor area.  Security was nonexistent at the first Walmart.  The store was relaxed, there were plenty of associates, they were helpful, etc.  The store was actually pretty nice, the only thing out of place was the weirdly low prices compared to any other store in that area.  At the other end of the scale, the store in the poor area (which is also majority black, whether or not this is actually a factor in their behavior I can only speculate) had a half dozen security cars in the parking lot with their little flashing yellow lights.  Gates at the entrance manned with security personnel, uniformed security inside the store.  And the icing on the cake?  They were checking 9 out of 10 people&#x27;s bags on the way out of the store, sort of like Costco.  Except me.  Waived me right on through.  Because I&#x27;m not black?  I have no idea.  But it sure did weird me out.

            The availability of that option depends on your appearance: affluent middle-aged white people can usually do it but if you’re a teenager or match whatever demographic is poor in the area, you have to weigh that versus escalation possibly including armed police response.

            Especially when it&#x27;s, say, Walmart which has built a business on crowding out competitors in an area — are you really going to spend an extra 40+ minutes driving somewhere else out of spite? The power dynamic here seems quite unbalanced.

            It depends entirely on the specific Walmart and the neighborhood where it&#x27;s located.  I&#x27;ve been traveling the US this summer and have stopped at many Walmarts.  Some are well stocked, beautifully maintained stores that you waltz into and out of without a care or delay.  Some are run like minimum security prisons, with cameras, gates, security and screens to show you you&#x27;re on camera (mostly in the makeup isles).<p>Some Walmart are well stocked, spacious and clean.  Some are ravaged, dirty and filled with tourists.  It&#x27;s really amazing the variety of quality.

            It just makes for a shitty experience. I grew up in a blue-collar family and still dress that way, even though I&#x27;m firmly upper-middle class now. I took my wife to a high end mall for a her birthday one year, and when we were looking at designer purses, the security in the store followed us the entire time, presumably because their typical customers don&#x27;t wear jeans, tshirts, and sneakers. We noticed the security in all the stores were doing it, and eventually we just left without buying anything because we didn&#x27;t like being treated like criminals because of how we dress. Even though we could easily afford to buy things there, we haven&#x27;t been back to that mall since.

            Except plently of people do wear jeans, tshirts, and sneakers.  And probably don&#x27;t get scrutinized like that.

            It depends on the target. Theft was so bad at one that I used to live near, that they installed a police substation specifically for the target within the building.

            Just last month I was in a target and they had a plain cloths security officer following a black teenager around the store (and not being very subtle about it IMO). I went up to the teenager and told him he was being followed. That seems like hostile behavior to me, but I&#x27;m sure it varies store-to-store.

            I guess the management at those corporations is so bad they do not realize they are driving profits away by spending money to make it feel like a prison.<p>Or management is using tons of experience and data to do what they have to do to stay in business in a 2% profit margin business, inconveniencing customers if they have to in order to prevent losses so they do not have to close the store.

            I think it&#x27;s on a store-by-store basis. My grandfather works at a Wal-Mart in a small town with a large minority population and said they average 10-12K in merchandise stolen each month. The store is open 24 hours, but they still only have 1 security guard working 9-5 because they&#x27;d lose more money from lost sales due to minority groups typically having bad experiences with authority figures and avoiding the store.

            I started to type <i>&quot;That&#x27;s not facial recognition&quot;</i>, then deleted it...<p>The green box that you&#x27;re describing is <i>recognizing that _A_ face is in view of the camera</i>. This is often used for properly adjusting focus, exposure, etc... I suppose you could call it &quot;facial recognition&quot;, because that&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s doing. But it&#x27;s fairly benign and passive. This technology exists in my DSLR cameras that have no network connection and do not save any facial data anywhere in the image.<p>But then there is facial recognition that knows <i>who you are</i>, it&#x27;s connected to a network, and it logs where you go - and these back-end systems correlate this data with other data that&#x27;s been collected about you. Systems that <i>know who you are</i> are what is generally meant when discussing &quot;<i>facial recognition</i>&quot;.<p>This article doesn&#x27;t say.

            Yes. But the only reason they need to identify what is a face in the camera is as a step in facial recognition. It&#x27;s not like the security cameras are adjusting their focus or exposure.

            Its just security theater as a theft deterrent. The idea is that if you see a screen with a green box around your face then you believe that they&#x27;ve got a good look at you and if you steal then they can use the images.<p>Walmart isn&#x27;t investing money building networked cameras with the processing ability to perform facial recognition at scale in real time.

            It&#x27;s entirely possible that they are only pretending to do facial recognition as theft deterrent.<p>They could also be recording the video and doing the facial recognition offline - the analytics aren&#x27;t valuable in realtime.

            I wonder how pervasive this actually is. I&#x27;ve worked a bit in retail technology and we put some sensors in live stores. Tracking dwell time and pings of wifi access points. They generated a ton of noise and almost zero actionable data. Every attempt failed to be deployed to a second store. We had some success with facial recognition but only in really funneled spaces where we could get a customer to look at a camera on purpose. And it was still only about 90% accurate.

            When store employees are told not to physically detain any shoplifter, it hardly matters at all if they tell a serial shoplifter to leave the store.   The shoplifter will walk around the confronting employee, grab whatever they like off the shelves, and walk out without paying for it.  (I&#x27;ve seen this happen numerous times at 7-11, where the facial recognition is being run by store employees using their eyeballs&#x2F;brains.)<p>The real victims of this will be the false positives.   People who follow the rules, but get incorrectly classified as shoplifters.   They will be the ones who are actually turned away at the door.

            Humans won’t detain anyone, but probably in the future there will be mechanistic countermeasures — e.g. the doors of the store just not opening for shoplifters (or at all, while shoplifters continue to be present — to prevent shoplifters from sneaking in ahead&#x2F;behind a non-blacklisted customer.)<p>Unmanned stores in the Amazon Go mould are already switching from turnstiles to airlock-style entryways; these can easily recognize and deny shoplifters access. (Never mind that these stores also usually have some form of <i>positive</i> identification, e.g. a card tap or hand-print scan being required to enter; so it’d really just be a matter of blacklisting the account associated with your credential.)<p>There’s no reason that manned stores couldn’t adopt these more-strict entry access systems as well; manned stores just haven’t invested in such technology yet, because they don’t <i>need</i> it in the way unmanned stores do (where an unmanned store without an entry-access system could literally experience 100% “shrinkage”, if someone decided to back a truck up and start loading.)<p>Alternately, the facial recognition could just trigger a phonecall; which, combined with a simple policy that any car belonging to a shoplifter has no right to park in the lot, would mean that such cars would have a tow called on them the second the shoplifter gets out of their car and walks into view of a camera. This wouldn’t work in most of the world, but in the car-centered US, I could see it being a very effective deterrent.

            I recently saw a viral video of a seagull shoplifting a bag of chips.  The automatic doors didn&#x27;t open for the seagull, so the bird just waited until a permitted human approached the door.<p>A &quot;mantrap&quot; entrance (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mantrap_(access_control)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mantrap_(access_control)</a> ) could solve this, but I think many stores don&#x27;t have the space for it.  That 7-11 doesn&#x27;t.  Also, neither the cops nor the towing company will show up in time to do anything about it.

            Thank you; a mantrap was exactly what I was trying to describe in my other comments, but didn&#x27;t know the word for it.<p>It&#x27;s not true that a 7-11 doesn&#x27;t have room for a mantrap; remember that an unmanned store doesn&#x27;t have a cash register &#x2F; checkout counter, or any space behind such for a person to stand. A manned store could be retrofitted into a secure unmanned store by installing the mantrap entrance into exactly that area.

            They don&#x27;t lock you in. The point of an entry-access system is to gate <i>entry</i>, not <i>exit</i>.<p>To get in, you need to register a credit card. The store observes what you take, and charges that credit card for those items when you leave. If you&#x27;re inside, you&#x27;ve necessarily given them everything they need to charge you asynchronously for everything you take while you&#x27;re there. You can leave at any time.<p>The point of entry-access is to prevent people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> have a registered active credit card from coming into the store, and so walking away with things <i>that the store cannot then charge to anyone&#x27;s account</i>.

            Do you mean that denying <i>entry</i> is illegal, or denying <i>exit</i> is?<p>Because these unmanned stores do let you <i>leave</i>; they just have separate entry and exit doors, which have mutual-exclusion locking (like an airlock) such that nobody can enter the store through the exit door by getting someone inside the store to open the inner door. (You could slip into the little individual exit hall through the outer exit door; but the inner door <i>in</i> the little exit hall would remain locked until you left and it detected there were no longer people in the hall. Presuming a high-traffic store, this also wouldn&#x27;t hold anything up, as other customers would continue to exit through the bank of other exit halls to either side of you.)<p>I haven&#x27;t checked, but presumably pulling a fire alarm inside the store would disable all this security, flinging both the entry and exit doors open. But you can&#x27;t reach the fire alarm in the exit hall; it&#x27;s not &quot;inside&quot; the store. The only thing you can do in the exit hall, is exit (which you are always free to do.)

            Hm interesting, so I guess like all things in security&#x2F;privacy it boils down to an economic war :-&#x2F;  How much effort are you willing to put into masks vs. how much effort an adversary is willing to spend to defeat it.<p>It says that there is no single face mask that can defeat every system.  That&#x27;s an interesting point, but what about the converse?  There&#x27;s probably no single recognition system that can defeat every mask.<p>edit: I also think it&#x27;s not that unacceptable to wear a mask and sunglasses anymore either, though I&#x27;ve never tried.

            Given the numerous videos of shoplifters just walking into SF stores and stealing in plain view while being recorded, I doubt this will stop any of them.

            This is only bad if there is no way to appeal such a decision. If implemented well this is probably a good thing. Shoplifting raises prices&#x2F;reduces availability for shoppers who don’t shoplift (yes, it lowers profit too. It does both).

            That&#x27;s very well possible but there are numerous workaround for that that would still allow you to uniquely identify a phone. Regardless: the push to identify people out and about, the push to tie those identities to online behavior is real and relentless, and relatively little is done to curb this. Personally I think all of these transaction should be done only with consenting adults or by - presumably properly overseen - law enforcement acting after they obtained a warrant.

            Wifi and&#x2F;or bluetooth media addresses, which are unique. I&#x27;ve heard that wifi tracks you to the store, bluetooth to the aisle in the store. A lot of people have all this enabled on their phones, right? Then there&#x27;s the apps installed on so many phones that are built using facebook sdk&#x27;s and similar that include a lot of spyware.<p>I have the impression that stores doing this are working with data aggregator to associate this information with other sources of info, like credit card purchases, facial recognition, phone number and imei, etc.

            I read up on this [0]. It looks like it helps to have a newer phone, and even then this feature is inconsistent across models, with some phones spewing non-random frames even when wifi is off and&#x2F;or depending on how location services is configured. Although I would assume the feature will continue to be better implemented as time goes on, it doesn&#x27;t look like something that is protecting most people yet.<p>I read a bit about bluetooth tracking [1]. Apple and Google both apparently support this kind of tracking via apps, and a lot of apps use toolkits made by advertisers that do this. Apple has been selling their iBeacon devices that can be located in stores to track people. Here&#x27;s [2] something about google tracking via bluetooth even when bluetooth is turned off.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;wifi_tracking_failures&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;wifi_tracking_failure...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;bluetooth-wireless-tracking-privacy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;bluet...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;1169760&#x2F;phone-data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;1169760&#x2F;phone-data&#x2F;</a>

            I heard it&#x27;s a lot more than the specific store app tracking people in that store. I&#x27;ve heard that there are tons of toolkits and sdks used to build apps that have this kind of  tracking built into them, for example [0]: 79 out of 123 manually tested educational apps tested were sending data to 140 advertising companies. Another article [1] saying that Apple has done nothing to stop this, either.<p>I&#x27;d assume that anyone with location services enabled and&#x2F;or more than a few very well chosen apps is being tracked via these methods. I assume that most popular apps include this stuff, and most people are being tracked.

            Seems weird this wouldn&#x27;t really be discussed, but this also means that aggressively publicizing this simple fact, and lobbying for very obvious consent &amp; information obligations, might be enough to reign in these practices.

            I tried telling random adults on the main street in my University town that Target was using non-disclosed facial recognition, about four years ago, for a while. The rate of response was less than half for people to show concern.  I also somewhat-randomly discovered a local &quot;facial aware&quot; security system installer at the coffee shop. Once he noticed I was asking pointed questions about consent, he changed his tone and said &quot;yeah I install a bunch of high tech shit&quot; and ended the conversation. Weeks later I saw him driving by and rode my bicycle next to him in traffic making a scene (saying nothing that could be construed as a threat).  He was a little shaken that time I hope.<p>As a US Citizen I am strongly opposed to non-disclosed facial recognition in commercial settings. The covid masking is almost like Greek-fable humor of the gods, rendering even ATM (perfect picture) facial recognition moot.

            There are requirements for the CCTV notices already.. you probably haven&#x27;t noticed, because they&#x27;re tiny and out of the way.  Plus a lot of establishments use non-committal language like &quot;may be recorded by CCTV&quot; (almost as if every retailer added the signs but only some of them added the tech).<p>It would be great if this was posted, boldly, clearly.  As long as there are data protection limits (only 3 month&#x27;s history can be maintained, data is unrecoverably disposed of) and accommodations for those who do not consent. (If every grocery store adopts the tech, how will you buy groceries if you do not accept these practices?)

            This may be a stupid idea and it is outside my expertise (IANAL): Would legally classifying identity information as intellectual property help? I don&#x27;t know the case law around identity as private property but I would imagine requiring someone to enter into a legally binding contract just to enter a store would kill efforts like these pretty fast.

            Why is this comment thread veering off to &quot;American exceptionalism&quot;?. The straigtforward answer as to why the title says &quot;Many americans...&quot; is that they conducted a nation-wide survey of americans. They could have done a global survey, but they didn&#x27;t, probably because:<p>1. it would be much more expensive and logistically challenging (eg. localizing the questions)<p>2. the readership of the media company that commissioned the survey is mostly american<p>It&#x27;s not because of &quot;American exceptionalism&quot; or whatever.

            I have never heard any politician here say &quot;British people are x&quot; or that &quot;British people feel y&quot;. In America such expressions appear in almost every speech. Likewise for news headlines etc. In the UK the title would be &quot;customers not aware&quot; and the like. This is to give the (correct) impression that the entire nation has in no way been united by this fact. But in the US it seems more common to use terminology that lumps everyone together, to the exclusion of the rest of the world.

            Some shop uses face recognition. Who cares enough to bother finding that out? (not to say it isn&#x27;t important) It hardly indicates a social trend.

            I&#x27;m honestly perplexed by the discussion here. Why should I care that a grocery store is using this? They already have camera systems - what is it about feeding that data into a facial recognition algorithm that is so awful?<p>They want to identify who their customers are and already do a good job of it with loyalty cards. I often have to show my ID when I buy beer. I&#x27;m in a public place where I have no expectation of privacy. I run into my neighbors in the grocery store and say Hi.<p>What exactly should I be trying to hide here?

            If i&#x27;m reading this right, i see two arguments here.<p>The first is a slippery slope. They are starting to use facial recognition now and will soon be asking for my DNA and fingerprints. I just don&#x27;t agree that the slope is slippery. Why would my grocery store care to collect that information? We&#x27;re talking about grocery store items - the company just wants to know what i&#x27;m buying so they can send me ads to buy more stuff. They have no interest in my fingerprints or DNA. This honestly just comes off as paranoid and conspiratorial.<p>The second argument is more interesting. You fear that different databases (grocery, driving, fitness, etc) will be joined together and deployed against us. I don&#x27;t think this is an unreasonable fear at all. However, I totally disagree that fighting this on the collection side will be fruitful. The unfortunate conclusion i&#x27;ve come to here is that there is no individual action I can take to stop the collection and collation of all this data. I can limit how much information I share - which I do when necessary - but again, what i&#x27;m buying at the grocery store is not the privacy hill worth dying on.<p>Instead the better way to fight this is with laws. The specific example you brought up is Health insurance discrimination but the problem with your example is that large parts of it are already banned by law:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Genetic_Information_Nondiscrim...</a><p>The Affordable Care Act added even more limits to what insurers can do to decide on rates.

            &gt; The first is a slippery slope.<p>Actually I mean something closer to shifting baseline [1] in a broader sense. We&#x27;ve just come to accept a vast loss of privacy as surveillance and data gathering has become so cheap, so pervasive, and insidiously hidden, that at this point it is impossible to stop it. The inertia is all rolling downhill at this point. The slippery slope has slipped and slid already, well past what we would have considered acceptable a generation ago. It was unthinkable when I was a kid in the 1980s or a teenager in the 1990s that they would do so much tracking, in meatspace and cyberspace.<p>And you&#x27;re right that there is no way to stop it, except through laws. The US government is completely asleep at the wheel. Worse, they&#x27;ve been paid off to be asleep at the wheel.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shifting_baseline" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shifting_baseline</a>

            You don&#x27;t think there is a qualitative difference between your security footage getting recorded -- maybe watched by a security guard half-paying attention -- and then written over, versus having it analyzed, tracked, and stored for an unknowable amount of time?<p>Or a difference between having the option of presenting your loyalty card, versus having your <i>face</i> implicitly being your loyalty card, with no way of knowing, and no way to opt out?<p>Or a cashier glancing at your ID to check that it&#x27;s legit and promptly forgetting about it, versus having it scanned and tied to the transaction, and combined with your other behavioral data?<p>When you see a camera on the street corner, is that the same to you as greeting your neighbor?

            There is a difference, yes. Most security footage is never viewed. It&#x27;s simply recorded and then reviewed later if there is an issue.<p>What facial recognition adds is that it identifies my presence there automatically but again - this is a grocery store we&#x27;re talking about. It&#x27;s a public place and I have no expectation of privacy.<p>They can identify that I entered the store, what aisles I went down, then at checkout can see what I bought. And why do I care?<p>I&#x27;m really not being edgy or flippant with that question. What is the concern here?

            Society is by its nature in part adversarial. If one group gets a new powerful tool at their disposal, it may change the current balance of power in their advantage. Just see how it works in an opposite case - crypto - where the common folks may increase, through innovative technology, their freedom from being herded by governments. The governments are extremely concerned about it, even though cryptocurrencies are perfectly legal and theoretically don&#x27;t change much (it&#x27;s just another means of transacting and storing value).

            Based on the phone number in your bio you appear to be based in chicago, is there a reason you are so worried about gov tracking but put your real name and phone number in your bio?<p>This just seems like all incredibly inconvenient as a training exercise but I can&#x27;t think of real reason someone on hn would do this only to make it very easy to ID them in other ways.

            Still need to be in WiFi range for that… 90% of smartphone things are better on a computer, only convenience makes ppl use the smartphone, but a big part of that convenience is mobile service and GPS. Take that out and you may as well get a dumb phone and use your laptop for everything else.

            The phone number itself is linked to them in someway. Paying for your physical device in cash is meaningless if you’re gonna connect to internet you own and use credit cards, etc to operate it.

            I think that’s definitely true in some countries but not all. For example, you can buy burner phone numbers (prepaid) in the United States without presenting ID.

            Do they do this even in their EU stores?<p>If so, is there any source showing that? I&#x27;m sure some of the DPAs would be excited to hear about a company using biometrics, likely in violation of Art. 9 GDPR.
