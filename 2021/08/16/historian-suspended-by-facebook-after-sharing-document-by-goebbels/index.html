            <i>&quot;Goebbels had thus demanded all German soldiers, having stayed in Paris for six months, be transferred to the Eastern Front to negate any “adverse” effects of billeting in the French capital.&quot;</i><p>Corrupted by the enemy, always a problem with occupying forces.<p>The American version of this is &quot;Your Job in Germany&quot;.[1] This was made for US occupation troops in Germany. Directed by Frank Capra and written by Theodor Geisel (&quot;Dr. Seuss&quot;), an unexpected collaboration that seems to work. The message: &quot;You are in an enemy country. Take no chances. No fraternization with any of the German people.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s become harder to view this video. The YouTube version, uploaded directly by the US National Archives [2], is now &quot;age restricted&quot;. Of the Internet Archive versions, only the Ogg Vorbis version is still playable.<p>See it now, before the Thought Police delete all the copies as &quot;hate speech&quot;.<p>Understanding what went wrong after WWI is helpful in understanding what went wrong in Afghanistan. It&#x27;s not directly comparable, but it&#x27;s important to know that the US had, in the past, changed minds and societies by military force, successfully.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;YourJobInGermany1945&#x2F;YourJobInGermany1945.ogv" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;YourJobInGermany1945&#x2F;YourJobInG...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=821R0lGUL6A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=821R0lGUL6A</a>

            I agree that this video is very important to archive and make available to view. I don&#x27;t disagree with Youtube&#x27;s decision on age restriction. I watched the video, and there are several scenes showing dead bodies. I think making that available, but age restricted, is a fair compromise.

            I always wondered how come in the US you cannot watch porn before 18, or drink before 21, but you can go to war at 16.<p>I am not sure if this is still correct, but you could play in a porn movie but not be allowed to watch it either.

            He shared a newly discovered unpublished document written by Goebbels with other historians.  He did not make a comment in his post, because he felt the document itself was comical enough to be funny.<p>This was in no way propaganda since the order was about German soldiers contracting VD in Parisian brothels.<p>Facebook banned it&#x2F;him.<p>He makes his own point pretty concretely...<p>&gt; It must be stressed that any objective investigation of history and research of the past becomes simply impossible if quotations from primary sources are grounds for punishment. Any curtailing of documentary evidence leads not to peace in the community but to the preordained failure to learn from history. It eventually allows the tragedies of the past to be repeated anew.

            I&#x27;ve always wished to live in a world where high end science and humanities research happens on the open internet so that people outside academia (like myself) can participate as a member of an interested audience.<p>With YouTube removing videos about CoVid from people who are actively working&#x2F;researching the virus (because they disagree with the CDC and WHO guidelines), and FB removing historical artifacts by a Historian because such things must only happen behind paywalled journals that only large universities can afford, I worry that the internet is moving away from being a place where information is freely available.<p>I still think that everyone should host their own blog and have an RSS feed that people can subscribe to and have independent editorial control. But I also want to see YouTube and Facebook succeed as internet companies by enabling regular people like me listen to experts disagree about controversial topics and see how consensus slowly forms at the end of rigorous debate among experts.

            If you think about that old school ideal Internet, you also have to think about other ideal like everyone can start a server. It&#x27;s not possible anymore. If you relies on VPS, it&#x27;s no better than Facebook.<p>Sure, as an individual, you can afford a server hardware, but not the network. ISP is as same as Facebook.<p>Also, it&#x27;s so cheap to DoS the server single person can afford. If you relies on CDN, that&#x27;s another Facebook.

            I&#x27;m not as pessimistic as you are regarding VPSes. There are providers that care about free speech, but you&#x27;ll almost only hear about them in a negative light because they host content from people with disgusting views.<p>There is also tech like IPFS or even Tor, which provide censor-resistant options.

            The problem is most likely that the moderators do pattern matching for certain key phrases rather than trying to understand its intention. Automatic tools can really only do this.<p>This is very common in moderation and censorship. It&#x27;s a problem, because you get false positives like this, and some topics becomes impossible to discuss, even for people that discuss them in a neutral manner. It also makes it very easy for people with actual Nazi sympathies and other extremist views to hide from censorship by not mention the wrong key phrases that matches the patterns.

            In all likelihood, the business model where users can get a free service for trading their data to advertisers cannot sustain a reasonably qualified human moderation service. So bots it is, but bots cannot really understand human culture and behave like mindless sledgehammers.<p>If FB et al. are one day required to provide human moderation, they will go bankrupt.

            Might I suggest using a personal&#x2F;professional website that you control. You could even pay someone to set this up for you. But nobody uses those any more. Could it be that that’s the real issue: voluntarily handing over control of your contacts, data and reputation to an entity like Facebook – at no cost to the user – by default and then complaining about not being in control?

            I was motivated to think of these use cases of sharing research when I found out a project to scan, transcribe and translate thousands of hand written journals was done by sending memory cards back and forth. I thought maybe Fossil scm would be a good option with file blob and wiki support, but the learning curve isn’t there, people take the path of least resistance.<p>I think a lot of research groups are still in list-servs, and I haven’t seen any social networks catering to advancing cross disciplinary research.

            This is so bizarre. The guy is posting literal Nazi propaganda - as in literally a document written by Goebbels, finds it removed from Facebook for violating community standards, and concludes that the reason must be that Facebook is <i>sympathetic</i> to Goebbels&#x27; worldview?<p>Is this a good-faith accusation?

            1. The document is NOT Nazi propaganda.  It was the short document which described a proposal to isolate German soldiers who have spent too much time in Paris, as they might have caught VD from prostitutes.  This was a common problem at the time that also affected the US troops on leave there.  He did not provide any commentary on the subject in his post, but noted in his blog that it&#x27;s a ridiculously overzealous notion to send soldiers all the way to the eastern front, just because they spent time in Paris.<p>2. He questions whether the Russian Facebook mods that censored him were Nazi supporters, exactly because the document in question makes Goebbels look like an idiot.  So yes, that&#x27;s a good faith question to raise.

            I believe it was a tongue-in-cheek accusation. But the line of thinking was that this piece of text should be considered so embarrassing to Goebbels due to its obvious wrong headedness, that somebody sympathetic to him or the Nazi movement might want to hide it to avoid the embarrassment.

            That was my reading, although I&#x27;m not as unsympathetic to Facebook&#x27;s moderators here as he is. He wrote that &quot;I did not comment on any of Goebbels’ words, considering them to be so obviously preposterous that its sheer absurdity rendered any additional commentary redundant,&quot; and...really? If you are a moderator charged with flagging pro-Nazi commentary on Facebook, you have undoubtedly seen post after post after post after post of &quot;obviously preposterous&quot; Nazi propaganda that people not only take at face value, but cheer for and put on signs and organize rallies around. When a moderator comes across this particular Nazi propaganda posted as-is with no commentary, it&#x27;s nice to believe that they&#x27;ll think &quot;ah, perhaps I should stop now and deeply research <i>this</i> man, and consider that he is a Russian academic who has written papers on German-Soviet interactions and conflicts leading up to World War II, which I should now read the abstracts of in order to determine where his personal sympathies might lie.&quot; But they won&#x27;t. Because that&#x27;s not really their job.

            Well, <i>I</i> don&#x27;t, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like the right rule. I also certainly don&#x27;t think that, say, genocide makes the speaker (whether Goebbels or a modern-day advocate) look good, but that hardly seems like a reason to permit people to post advocacy of genocide!<p>The very definition of extremist ideologies is that they are extremist, and that reasonable people who haven&#x27;t been infected with it don&#x27;t agree. But - by and large - we don&#x27;t see that as a reason to allow open advocacy of extremism. Clearly Goebbels had a target audience in mind that he thought could be convinced to agree with him.<p>So I think a rule &quot;You cannot post things by Goebbels that advocate Nazi ideology&quot; makes sense, and I think a rule &quot;You cannot post things by Goebbels that advocate Nazi ideology, unless reading and pondering that document would leave the average reader less convinced of the merits of Nazism&quot; does not make sense.

            Here in Germany &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; is illegal to sell. I was always amazed that it was available in the US (or so I heard).

            Until 2016 all new printings were stopped on copyright grounds by the state of Bavaria. Hitlers registered address at time of death was in Munich, so the state of Bavaria acquired his assets and used that to stop printings (internationally not often successful, and with the exceptions of US and GB, where the rights had been sold to Random House by Hitlers publisher), but 2016 (70 years after death of the author) the copyright expired. Copyright was fairly straight-forward legally, commented editions now are too.
