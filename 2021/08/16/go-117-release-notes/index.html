            To me, the most interesting change is the performance improvement due to the new register-based calling convention. Your CPU-bound programs will magically get 5% faster when compiled with 1.17:<p>&gt; Go 1.17 implements a new way of passing function arguments and results using registers instead of the stack. Benchmarks for a representative set of Go packages and programs show performance improvements of about 5%, and a typical reduction in binary size of about 2%. This is currently enabled for Linux, macOS, and Windows on the 64-bit x86 architecture (the linux&#x2F;amd64, darwin&#x2F;amd64, and windows&#x2F;amd64 ports).<p>I love how they&#x27;re doing it in such an iterative fashion: even assembly functions don&#x27;t have to be rewritten. Then again, I guess doing it progressively like this is the only feasible way to avoid reworking all the low-level assembly routines in one fell swoop.

            Wow, this update is awesome: my GoAWK interpreter (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benhoyt&#x2F;goawk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benhoyt&#x2F;goawk</a>) runs a simple CPU-bound AWK program 38% faster when compiled with Go 1.17 (compared to 1.16).<p><pre><code>  $ time goawk_go1.16 &#x27;BEGIN { for (i=0; i&lt;100000000; i++) s += i; print(s) }&#x27;

I wonder why it&#x27;s so much better than their advertised 5% perf improvement?

            Hi, I&#x27;m one of the people who worked on it, and the guy who did the initial estimate back in early 2017.  5% is the geomean of a lot of benchmarks; a whole lot fall in the the 4-8% range, a few do worse because the new ABI creates new patterns of register use that don&#x27;t fit well with the current register allocator, and the fix was larger than we wanted to risk.  (See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;46216" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;46216</a> )

            The benefits come primarily from avoiding extra work spilling arguments to&#x2F;from the stack on function calls. If you are making lots and lots of function calls, particularly to small functions that can&#x27;t be inlined, there could certainly be much bigger improvements.

            The speed gained depends a lot on the structure of the code benchmarked. Natively written Go code has more computation happening in local loops without many function calls, the optimization brings less effect.
An interpreter often calls a function for every single directive executed. This means, you have a lot of function calls inside loops, sometimes for every single operation executed. This of course profits massively from this optimization.

            At first I didn&#x27;t like Go because I thought it was too opinionated. But the more I used it, the more I found the tooling to be just heads and shoulders above similar languages like C&#x2F;C++.<p>I use VSCode a lot, and in VSCode you can press &quot;F12&quot; to jump to the location of a function definition. In Go I find myself deep diving into github libraries all the time just because F12 takes me there. That <i>never</i> happened with C&#x2F;C++ - the tooling was just too disparate and fragile.<p>My biggest complaint with Go is lack of generics. I mean technically you can achieve generics with an unholy empty interface&#x2F;reflection incantation but it&#x27;s a huge pain compared to C++.

            I think people claiming modern C&#x2F;C++ tools are close to as good as Go’s are wrong, in my opinion. <i>With that having been said</i>, IMO if you want the C++ experience to be better, use Clangd and generate a compile_commands.json file. For many projects you can use wrappers like compiledb, or Bear, and some build systems like CMake can output it natively. Either way, once you have found a way to do this, and get it outputting into the project root, add a local ignore for it (in .git&#x2F;info&#x2F;exclude) and install the VSCode clangd extension.<p>Truly, it is night and day. I can get Real code intelligence on almost anything, including large C projects with custom Makefiles that compile cross-arch like Wine. It only ever has trouble with unusual translation unit patterns. (You can see this in Higan for example, which has .cpp files including other .cpp files; clangd seemingly fails to put them in the context of the intended translation unit.)<p>It’s not as good as Go, but it is life-changing for me.

            If you use C++ tools where your dependencies get pulled in and built from source like Go does, you get the same experience. If you only have prebuilt system libraries obviously this doesn&#x27;t work.<p>It&#x27;s not like Go&#x27;s tooling is that much better than the best modern C++ tools, but the ecosystem is so much more unified by having 1 blessed set of tooling. Rather than 20 different package managers&#x2F;(meta)build systems. No need to worry that I am using build system X, but I want to use a library using build system Y.

            This almost doesn&#x27;t happen when your tools are good. At Google the Kythe tool (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kythe.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kythe.io</a>) gracefully deals with templates, macros, and much more. Both &quot;go to definition&quot; and &quot;find references&quot; just work with 99.9% of C++ code, including within complicated macros and templates.<p>(The one and only case I&#x27;ve ever found it doesn&#x27;t work is to find references to a function that&#x27;s only called via ADL in a widely used template that&#x27;s instantiated with thousands of different types.)

            tbh I&#x27;ve had <i>dramatically</i> worse type-aware IDE features with Go than almost any other mainstream language. gopls routinely misses trivial things <i>in the same file</i>. Goland does substantially better, but it still has major problems gathering a complete call hierarchy, and basic things like moving a file to a different package (with no compilation issues, just import rewrites) still don&#x27;t work reliably.

            I hate to be &quot;that guy&quot;, but you should try Rust. It also has amazing tooling, and is probably more comparable to C&#x2F;C++, considering you don&#x27;t have to use a garbage collector in Rust.

            I really like Rust, but in my mind it&#x27;s still relegated to the periphery of tasks that must be super fast (like C&#x2F;C++, to your point) and&#x2F;or low-level. Rust has made impressive strides at reducing the toil involved in compile-time memory management, but there is still a big productivity gap between the borrow checker and GC.<p>Frankly, people are making boatloads of money off of software written in Python and JS--languages which are both far less safe than Go and far slower and yet Go is on par with those languages with respect to productivity (I argue it&#x27;s more productive due to its static typing features, but others argue it&#x27;s less productive presumably because of the learning curve). Most software doesn&#x27;t need to be so fast or correct.<p>Also, I work in distributed systems and SaaS (software as a service). In this world, most errors are silly type errors (&quot;undefined is not a function&quot;, forgetting to `await` some async function, etc) that would be caught with a flat-footed type system like Go&#x27;s. Beyond that, the next largest bucket are issues that even a sophisticated type system like Rust&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t help with, such as infrastructure issues (missing&#x2F;misconfiguration of some cloud permission, networking rule, etc), misconfiguration of the service, race condition with many processes accessing the same networked resource, deployment error, etc. This means that Rust&#x27;s stated advantages aren&#x27;t really as nice as they initially sound.<p>As a programmer, I can appreciate a super fast language with a strict type system; however, as an <i>engineer</i> or a <i>technologist</i>, Rust is rarely a good fit for me. Go seems to be a lot closer to the sweet spot, which makes sense because it was developed expressly with distributed systems in mind.

            &gt; In this world, most errors are silly type errors<p>I can’t speak to python, but typescript has basically fixed this problem overnight in the javascript ecosystem. The typescript compiler finds almost all small bugs like this while I’m coding. And as an added bonus, type hints allow the IDE to be much more helpful - adding to jump to function support, autocomplete, method parameter suggestions (or documentation on hover). And typescript is easier to read than javascript because you don’t have to guess what data type some variable is.<p>I love javascript’s quick and dirty nature, but I still use typescript instead of javascript now for any code I write that I expect to survive the week. (And as a bonus: you still get IDE type hints when calling typescript functions from raw javascript!)<p>Typescript’s type system is also more powerful than Go’s. It supports enums, genetics and type unions (eg x: string | number).<p>Go sits in the awkward place of having a worse type system and no significant advantages over typescript for me. It’s awkward to use go on the web. Go is faster than javascript on the server but that usually doesn’t matter. And when it does I can reach for C or Rust. Both of which work really well with native code, or with JS through wasm.<p>Rust is much harder to learn than Go - but personally I’ve climbed that hill already. Once you’re over that hill, Rust is much more expressive. On purpose both ways - go isn’t trying to be expressive, and rust is. I love rust’s parametric enums and output types in traits. Which I now sorely miss in other languages.<p>I can imagine Go shining a lot more brightly when working with a team which has mixed skill levels. Most of my work lately has been solo, so I don’t need gofmt to enforce a consistent code style, or anything like that. I do miss Go’s green threads. Rust’s afterthought scattergun approach with threads and futures feels like a mess. But I can’t see myself ever really using Go. It’s weak in areas I want it to be strong (eg the type system). And strong in areas I just don’t care much about. (Eg consistency).

            Rust is very expressive, but it also makes some tasks that are relatively simple in other languages much harder (anything involving tree structures, for instance), and some of what it gives you expressive control over is stuff you usually don&#x27;t need to think about at all in other languages.<p>Rust can do some things Go simply isn&#x27;t suited for right now; for instance, there is no way we&#x27;re getting kernel Go in the foreseeable future. You couldn&#x27;t reasonably build a browser, or browser components, in Go.<p>Both languages have their place. There is a lot of overlap, and the original comment about how one might prefer Rust if what they miss most in Go is generics makes sense. But the idea that the only thing you&#x27;d gain by choosing Go over Rust is easier development on big teams is just false. One language is GC&#x27;d, the other is borrow-checked. GC makes a lot of things faster to build. This debate ended in the mid-1990s.

            Yes, having written a b-tree in rust recently I can confirm this. My child node pointers look like this:<p><pre><code>    enum Node&lt;E: EntryTraits, I: TreeIndex&lt;E&gt;&gt; {
        Internal(Pin&lt;Box&lt;NodeInternal&lt;E, I&gt;&gt;&gt;),
        Leaf(Pin&lt;Box&lt;NodeLeaf&lt;E, I&gt;&gt;&gt;),
    }

Yikes. I could probably clean this up a little, but not a lot.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this code for months and I still have no idea if my internal b-tree functions should be taking a &amp;mut self, self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt; or a NonNull&lt;...&gt; or something else. The compiled code is blazing fast, and being able to control behaviour so clearly with a few parametric type parameters is amazing.<p>But the process of figuring out the best way to code it up is awful, and it requires all of my attention and capacity. I doubt Rust will ever gain the sort of mainstream usage that javascript &amp; Go have because of how complicated otherwise simple problems can become. Its a great language for the linux kernel and web browsers. But I can&#x27;t imagine many normal programmers will want to build regular websites and apps in rust.<p>GC languages are slower, but credit where its due - they make it so much easier to just dive in and spend all your braincells thinking about your problem domain.

            IMO, Go is the easiest language to read by far.  Python can be, but lets one use a lot of hard to figure out magic.  Go is very much WYSIWYG, and to me that&#x27;s its greatest strength.  It&#x27;s easy for anyone to jump in about anywhere.  And that lends itself well to teamwork.

            I find that&#x27;s only true so long as the problem you&#x27;re solving fits well into Go&#x27;s view of the world.<p>If you want to make a data structure holding the equivalent of a parametric enum (or tagged union from C), go is very awkward to use compared with richer languages like Swift or Rust. Go is also awkward if you want to implement custom generic data structures.<p>Eg, this[1] code I wrote a couple years ago for doing text based operational transform became about 1.5x longer in Go compared to rust or typescript because its so awkward to express a parametric enum in go. And it was much harder to read &amp; more buggy as a result. Sadly I lost the go version of the code. I&#x27;d be curious if someone with more go experience could do a better job, but I&#x27;m skeptical.<p>Hopefully the situation improves somewhat when generics land.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;josephg&#x2F;textot.rs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;03c84b7c35a375ba7dbb9c3db38923aaced4cccc&#x2F;src&#x2F;lib.rs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;josephg&#x2F;textot.rs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;03c84b7c35a375ba7d...</a>

            &gt; I can imagine Go shining a lot more brightly when working with a team which has mixed skill levels.<p>Thank you for expressing that thought. However: I came quite to the opposite conclusion. I´m currently working in a small team with members that are not so versatile in coding, coming from a JavaScript background. It has been surprisingly easy to teach them Spring Boot. You follow a typical layout and everything falls into its place. I have my reservation that the same holds true for Go. It feels like there is much more room for confusion. Do I use global functions or receivers? How do I inject my dependencies and where do manage them? How do I build constructors and do I really need them? I found surprisingly little advice on those topics.

            &gt; but there is still a big productivity gap between the borrow checker and GC.<p>The borrow checker and GC aren&#x27;t really doing the same thing though. One very important distinction in some fields (but unimportant in others) is that GC only really cares about memory resources. So you are (or should be) doing explicit <i>manual cleanup</i> for all non-memory resources in a GC language. Rust isn&#x27;t, in Rust we don&#x27;t write explicit resource cleanup for a programmable interrupt controller, or a file, or a database connection -- the resource knows how to manage itself, and Rust promises to tell it immediately when it falls out of use, whereas a GC can&#x27;t promise to <i>ever</i> clean up which is why Go doesn&#x27;t even bother providing a means to do this automatically for your non-memory resources when they&#x27;re garbage collected (Java does, but again, no promises it ever fires, so, don&#x27;t rely on this).

            Finalizers aren’t quite the same. They run when memory pressure exceeds some threshold, but the GC analog for borrow-checking is something that will clean up a resource when the pressure on the resource in question exceeds some threshold (e.g., file handles). And even then I’m not sure if that ticks all requirements for resource management.

            I meant to respond only to the quoted section comparing Java and Go, which states that Go doesn&#x27;t have a way to do cleanup on GC (finalizers).  I agree with you (and the two other replies and the quoted section itself) that finalizers are not a replacement for RAII etc.<p>I don&#x27;t use them for resource cleanup, but I think they probably make sense for library authors as a back-up mechanism (for example, the standard library has a finalizer to close file handles, and the current runtime does GC every two minutes in the absence of memory pressure).  You can also explicitly run the GC in Go, and while generally there&#x27;s a lot of problems with that idea I could <i>maybe</i> imagine it being viable for certain unusual workloads.

            You usually want to release non-memory resources deterministically, but finalizers in C#&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Go are not deterministic. That&#x27;s why finalizers usually are not used for resource management. Instead, C# has using statements, Java try-with-resources, Go defer statements.

            That is a misconception, RAII like code can be achieved in two ways:<p>- defer (possibly add a go vet check for when missing it)<p>- when Go 1.18 brings generics, the withFunc pattern from FP where lambdas get given a resource released on function exist, thus having regions&#x2F;arena like resource management

            The description for go vet says, &quot;it should be used as guidance only&quot;. Go vet is in fact a linter (go lint is <i>also</i> a linter, but one focused on style).<p>So what you&#x27;re doing there is adding a <i>control</i> to try to mitigate the consequences of a language failing.

            Fair. However, there continues to be an unresolved tension in the C++ community about whether they want C++ to focus on its considerable legacy by ensuring enduring compatibility (&quot;No ABI breaks, ever!&quot;) or to continue growing and changing even if that means not everybody can follow (&quot;Performance trumps compatibility, ship it!&quot;). Although we can anticipate some sort of <i>compromise</i>, it just isn&#x27;t possible to have a C++ 2x that delivers everything the modernizers want yet still runs people&#x27;s technically conforming C++ 11 code unchanged with that binary DLL they&#x27;ve got no source code for. Some people will be unhappy, maybe <i>everybody</i> in the C++ community will end up unhappy.<p>In the &quot;no breaking changes&quot; case I agree that C++ objects that live in the free store are in the same place as Go, the programmer has a responsible which they may not fulfil, to manage this resource and a linter can only help mitigate this problem.<p>But plenty of people <i>including Stroustrup</i> want to do lifetime management, despite potential breaking changes from that, and under lifetime management the compiler has visibility into your object lifetimes and can reject programs which inadvertently leak.<p>Now, that doesn&#x27;t (can&#x27;t) make leaks impossible, but it means any leak is now in some sense &quot;on purpose&quot; and would happen for GC&#x27;d resources too, it isn&#x27;t just an accident. For example Rust&#x27;s mem::forget will prevent the drop happening for the object you&#x27;re forgetting, but it&#x27;s not as though you type mem::forget() by mistake. You clearly wanted to achieve that (e.g. you stole the underlying Unix file descriptor from a File and sent it over a socket to a separate process, so now cleaning up that descriptor is the Wrong Thing™) and incorrect usage is not the same category of error as forgetting a with clause in Python.

            Correct, but except in very special cases, memory leaks are themselves considered bugs. Using memory leaks as an example of RAII not always working is, in my mind, similar to saying Rust doesn&#x27;t prevent memory errors since it has the &quot;unsafe&quot; keyword.

            Agreed, but per my original post, the additional safety that Rust affords protects against a very small share of bugs in SaaS applications. The value proposition isn’t good because you trade so much productivity for a small improvement in quality, and productivity is at a premium and quality (sadly) can be mitigated in other, less costly ways (e.g., progressively rolling out new changes, continuous deployment i.e., bugs can be patched in hours rather than months, etc).

            I have the opposite view on the type systems: Rust&#x27;s type system is really great for business logic because it&#x27;s really expressive (based on algebraic data types), but the language being made for low level stuff makes some things a pain. If you do something like DDD, ADTs really shine, especially when combined with pattern matching. I do agree that when you can afford a GC, Rust can be annoying.

            I really, really like type systems, but I’ve built enough software to know that the returns for most applications diminish after a Go-like type system is in place, and there are many other factors that are more important than type systems (and Rust gets a lot of these right too!) such as performance, productivity, tooling breadth and quality (especially build tooling and package management), ecosystem, deployment&#x2F;distribution story, learning curve, readability, etc. Ultimately I’m of the opinion that as cool as type systems are, for most software they need to exist in service of productivity which means you need a basic type system that helps you but gets out of your way. Type systems can’t catch many classes of bugs that are increasingly prevalent in a world where our services are getting increasingly smaller (or rather, where more infrastructure and networking are being put in between the logical components of our application) and we’re often able to detect bug fixes before they impact a significant number of users (progressive deployments, automated rollbacks, continuous deployment, etc) but the discourse around type systems hasn’t caught up yet.

            One especially is in the case where it&#x27;s boilerplate code that does not rely on any real deep thought but writes itself, and with the possibility of bugs in it, most of all.

            I hate to be &quot;that guy&quot; too, but coming from somebody who really likes Rust and is using it more and more (also at $dayjob now) we must admit that Go tooling is one step ahead. CPU profiler, allocation and heap profiler, lock contention profiler. It all comes out of the box.<p>Yes you have cargo flamegraph for profiling locally and you now have pprof-rs to mimick Go&#x27;s embedded pprof support. But allocation heap profiling is still something I struggle with.<p>I saw there was a pprof-rs PR with a heap profiler but there was some doubt as to whether it worked correctly; to get a feeling of how that approach would work but without having to fork pprof-rs I implemented the  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mkmik&#x2F;heappy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mkmik&#x2F;heappy</a>  crate which I can use to produce memory allocation flamegraphs (using the same &quot;go tool pprof&quot; tooling!) in real code I run and figure out if it works in practice before pushing it upstream.<p>But stuff you give for granted like figuring out which structure accounts for most used memory, is very hard to achieve. The servo project uses an internal macro that help you trace the object sizes but it&#x27;s hard to use outside the servo project.<p>The GC makes some things very easy, and it&#x27;s not just about programmers not having to care about memory; it&#x27;s also that the same reference tracing mechanism used to implement GC can be used to cheaply get profiling information.

            There are many differences, but the main ones are that it has less overhead when profiling, more thorough analysis features (Heaptrack&#x27;s GUI is relatively simple compared to it), and the next version will have scripting capabilities for analysis.

            &gt; But allocation heap profiling is still something I struggle with.<p>Switch to a dumb allocator and then profile mmap calls or page faults?

            Sorry I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re suggesting.<p>I currently intercept calls to 
malloc&#x2F;calloc&#x2F;realloc&#x2F;... and capture stack traces. This way I know how much memory gets allocated for each allocation site. Since allocations usually go through constructor calls, the presence of a constructor in the stack trace can let you infer how many structures of a given type are been allocated. Knowing how big they are is more tricky since allocation for the whole struct and its parts doesn&#x27;t have to happen entirely in the constructor (some structures like vectors and hashmaps can grow, some structures can collect data from other sources and then hold onto them, etc)<p>Furthermore to know how the live memory is broken down between object type and allocation sites, you also need to track freed memory. This is significantly more tricky to do efficiently. I currently take an allocation sample every N bytes being allocated and use a poisson process estimator to scale the total allocated bytes.<p>The only ways I know to account for in use memory is to track every single allocation or to add some extra space for every allocation where we record whether a block had been sampled and of yes, what was its corresponding allocation event.<p>Can you please elaborate more on your suggestion?

            Looks like I misunderstood, I was suggesting something more indirect than tracing calls to malloc. If you&#x27;re already doing that then I&#x27;m not aware of any better low-overhead solutions. There are high-overhead options such as valgrind&#x27;s dhat.

            Ah, the desperate Rust promoter crew enters the Go thread ...<p>Rust is great for language enthusiats doing hobby projects or for learning. The Rust book is great. Rust has great language features.<p>Having that said, Rust is the right tool for the job for a very small niche. Basically, if you would have used C++ before and don&#x27;t need much developer reach or mature libraries. And only for the rare cases you really cannot affort a GC (even though Go&#x27;s GC is highly optimized).<p>Go on the other hand, is an industrial strength proven and mature general purpose language. It is the best fit for various kind of networking application. Especially APIs, but also infrastructure where you can live with an GC. CLIs are great with Go as well.<p>If you&#x27;re working on a professional grade project (where the GC is acceptable), Go is much superior than Rust in all regards.<p>Rust is advertised for years and years and didn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s breakthrough yet. This empirical fact cannot be ignored. There&#x27;re reasons for this, of course. Some are:<p>- Writing Rust consumes so much more mental power with so little gain. That mental energy should be directed to solving the problem.<p>- Go makes everything besides your problem at hand easy. You can focus on solving your problem, not fighting the Borrow Checker<p>- Rust&#x27;s ecosystem is not reliable. Many essential libs are one-man-shows. Version 0.1 everywhere.<p>- Rust is for and by language enthusiats. If you need to rely on libs for longer than a couple of years it is a hight risk for your project<p>- In terms of real world performance: Go is so close to Rust that there&#x27;re very very very few use cases that really need that marginal gain

            Go should be understood as a replacement for C and C++.<p>If you&#x27;re writing a compiler, or some other project where extreme high performance is not necessary (e.g., if you&#x27;re willing to be, say, a factor of 2 slower than C) then Go is a good choice.<p>Go&#x27;s performance is excellent, and should be sufficient for all but the most demanding applications.

            Because GC will pause threads while requests are being served, this leads to latency spikes at the higher percentiles.<p>It introduces a whole distinct type of complexity into operating the server.<p>The latency of a request to your server is not just caused by the code that is ran to serve that request (which is how people intuitively would think about it), it can be caused by GC pauses that are happening because of the memory pressure caused by previous requests.

            Python&#x2F;Js are interpreted by default and not good system programming choices. Go is compiled. This comparison totally misses the mark. In fact Go was developed mostly as C++ but sometimes Python replacement at Google.

            And yet Go seems to have not captured many C++ developers, but rather developers from languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.<p>The Go team originally wanted to replace C++, especially inside Google, but they didn&#x27;t succeed. According to googlers on Hacker News, very few projects inside Google actually use Go.<p>The reason Go attracted these kinds of developers is precisely that it isn&#x27;t a systems programming language. Systems people want something like Rust instead.

            Under wider definition of “system software” you can consider db tech (etcd, cockroachdb, digraph) and compute management software (kubernetes, nomad, docker) to be included into that. Which is where Go is doing just fine. Lower level stuff is harder but because of gc not lack of generics

            It def convinced me. I wrote c++ for almost 10 year before switching to Go. Even after c++11 have come out it was still night and day. Anecdotally the team i left at google rewrote some of my stuff from c++ in Go that I didn’t get to at the time

            In my opinion they should have pushed for D instead of Go. It’s leagues better as a systems language if you can tolerate GC or if you can’t you just don’t use the GC.

            That&#x27;s just one of the ways to think about it. Java, .NET (I felt like adding these two to expand on the comparison), Python and JS are all languages with a relatively high level of abstraction and large and useful ecosystems surrounding them. They&#x27;re pretty popular for all sorts of application development, but all suffer from certain problems:<p><pre><code>  - Java has lots of brittle reflection in some libraries and JDK can be finicky, especially with GC tuning
  - .NET needs a runtime, historically there&#x27;s Mono, now there was .NET Core and now there will be just .NET, though in some cases there&#x27;s also IL2CPP and so on
  - Python not only generally runs slow, but also has problematic package management, especially with vent
  - JS (Node in particular) has similar package management woes as well as really fast package deprecation
</code></pre>
Go at least partially solves some of those problems, by being compiled, having decent performance, somewhat rich ecosystem and passable package management, all while the language remains usable.<p>Lots of applications and some tools will get written in Go because of this, because it&#x27;s pretty reasonable to use in most cases.<p>In comparison, C, C++, Zig and Rust would all be better suited for systems level programming or embedded development - they typically let you write more performant and less memory hungry code, at the expense of foot guns and slower development.

            I do both C# and Go so have no axe to grind here. Just two small points though.<p>&gt; <i>.NET needs a runtime</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t. With a single command .NET Core can produce stand-alone single-file cross-platform deployables needing no SDK, Framework, runtime, or other dependency on the server.<p>&gt; <i>Go at least partially solves some of those problems, by being compiled, having decent performance, somewhat rich ecosystem and passable package management, all while the language remains usable.</i><p>It does, and I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Go for a fair few years now. However every point made in that sentence applies equally to .NET too.<p>The one area where Go beats C# (and most others) hands-down for me is the build time. It&#x27;s a whole order of magnitude (possibly several) faster than most alternatives.

            Partially agreed, many times it&#x27;s just a patch over a codebase that&#x27;s stuck only running on JDK 8 - people expect tuning to be sufficient when the code is slowly rotting.<p>I&#x27;d argue that most systems that won&#x27;t die out eventually will need a rewrite, or alternatively, in the modern day we&#x27;ll see more and more polyglotic systems popping up.<p>Therefore it always makes sense to explore the best options for a particular bit of development, regardless of whether it&#x27;s Node, Python, Java, Go or something else.

            Even with generics, it has so many issues:<p>* Error handling is error prone and awkward.<p>* No proper enums<p>* No sum types&#x2F;pattern matching<p>* Null pointers exist<p>* Its interfaces are very awkward. There are superior implementations of what they tried to do in other languages.<p>* Subpar IDE experience, made worse by how interfaces are implemented. You need an IDE for any non-trivial project.<p>* Very awkward choice to have visibility be determined by the case of the first letter in the function or variable.

            Cross-platform Intellisense support in VSCode with the Microsoft C&#x2F;C++ extension has improved a lot lately, especially in combination with the CMake Tool extension to automatically discover header search paths and other compilation settings (it used to be very brittle in the beginning on Linux and Mac).<p>But if you&#x27;re coding C&#x2F;C++ in a &quot;proper&quot; IDE like Visual Studio, CLion or Xcode, such features are expected to work out of the box. IME, Intellisense-like features are usually only a pain to setup in &quot;non-integated&quot; development environments like Vim or other text editors.

            When I started using Go I was more than sceptical. I had to mirgrate a CLI tool written in Kotlin (still my favorite language) because the memory consumption was to high.<p>After a while I actually understood why Go is such a successful language &#x2F; ecosystem:<p>Go&#x27;s priority is to make projects easier. It is doing so by all it&#x27;s smaller and larger features respectivly skipped features. But one soon understands the big picture of the Go team. Go is designed by very experienced devs who knew what is important and what not.<p>In my Go projects, I don&#x27;t have to worry about:<p>- Memory safety<p>- Tooling<p>- Performance<p>- Structure (once I understood the package desgin philosophie)<p>- Difficult syntax<p>- Concurrency<p>- Libraries, as we can do most with the standard lib<p>- Maturenes and stability<p>Instead I focus on the things that count:<p>- Solve the problem at hand<p>- Create correct, stable and maintable software<p>And as this was not enough, the Go team comes around the corner with an 5 % average performace gift.<p>Awesome.

            Same here. I very rarely reach for a debugger. Especially with Go where you can recompile the binary very quickly.<p>I tend to reach for a debugger when doing post mortem debugging or when I work with C where that&#x27;s usually the easiest way to get a stack trace when a program crashes.<p>That said, time travel &#x2F; reverse debuggers can be quite useful indeed: see

            VsCode or IntelliJ with delv works beautifully for most common tasks. But don’t compare to JVM&#x2F;Java. It does get trickier if you have many concurrent&#x2F;goroutines but that is not unique to Go.

            python 2 -&gt; 3 was not easy (aka a total nightmare).<p>By 3.6 it was pretty good though and even migrations and dual code bases were easier because they went back and allowed things like u&quot;&quot; for unicode strings to continue to mean unicode strings in python 3 - before that they&#x27;d actually blocked unicode in 3 that was working well in 2.x code bases! It was a total in your face move to break the ecosystem even though supporting u&quot;&quot; would have been almost no cost in terms of improving compatibility with existing code. ASCII handling (important for things like web tech stacks header handling etc) also improved thankfully. 3.x made things a lot harder initially (and slower too).<p>Also a lot of code doesn&#x27;t look the same over time - the conventions (formatting) are either very poorly defined or change. Go seems to have pretty much one format from fmt<p>etc

            Well, there were good reasons to change the way py2 worked with Unicode, and I don&#x27;t think this could have been made right without severe breakage either way. The only thing that should have happened sooner is support for u&quot;&quot; literals.

            I’ve been using Go at a large software company for 4 years. It does the job, my biggest complaints are the low capacity for abstraction, verbosity and ergonomic pain points. It can do certain things  well, but in a large enough project you’ll inevitably find that it doesn’t give you the best tools for certain types of problems.<p>I don’t know what to think about the upcoming generics. It feels late to make such a big change so long after the language has been established. At least a plan for it should have been integrated into the language from the start.<p>It feels like a missed opportunity - an effort with similar funding but a more sound theoretical foundation than being Newsqueak 3.0 could have become an industry game changer. Instead it fills a niche, which is a success, albeit smaller.

            &quot;It feels like a missed opportunity&quot;<p>I agree with that. I think looking back on it, Go arrived on to the scene at a perfect time where lots of people were rearchitecting so there was lots of natural appetite in the industry for a new language. Go vacuumed up a lot of this opportunity but ultimately hasn&#x27;t really evolved the practice of software engineering all that much.

            Go is my favorite language to write code in. I was very skeptical when I first started learning it for a new job with error handling that looked archaic in comparison to exceptions but once I got the hang of it it has quickly become my preferred language of choice for any project.<p>Once generics are finally added the language should basically be a no-brainer for any serious production code.

            From a distance it looks difficult to write in. For example, two recommended ways to delete from a slice:<p><pre><code>    a = append(a[:i], a[i+1:]...)

    a = a[:i+copy(a[i:], a[i+1:])]

            I&#x27;m not sure what their answer means. They used a similar hand wavy answer about why the language has null pointers. &quot;Complication&quot; here refers to how complicated their implementation of the compiler is, not the end user complication, which is what they traded off (simpler compiler for more complex user code).<p>I didn&#x27;t get the last point. builtin functions are there (for a big part) because the language doesn&#x27;t have generics. Functions on types can be added without affecting the interface, since strings don&#x27;t implement any interface (at least not on purpose, another problem with golang). Java constantly enriches standard library types with more useful methods.

            No, you deal with slices all the time. You just recognize the idiom.<p>You can restructure it if you don&#x27;t need to preserve order:<p><pre><code>    a[i] = a[len(a)-1]

            This has been my experience as well: I had to fix a bug in a Go codebase recently, and the fix required me to de-duplicate an unordered collection of elements. It turns out that there&#x27;s (1) no built-in way to do this, and (2) there isn&#x27;t even a built-in set structure in Go, so you can&#x27;t do the obvious solution without explicitly using a map with a chaff value. Stack Overflow has <i>dozens</i> of duplicate questions for this, all with ridiculous O(n^2) or buggy (or both) answers.

            Zero Size optimisations are a thing in Rust too though, and I don&#x27;t think an empty struct being zero size is any more surprising than Rust&#x27;s empty tuple being zero size.<p>Like, if you tell Rust you want 4 million empty tuples in a vector, it will give you a vector with exactly 4 million empty tuples in it and <i>no heap allocation</i> because those empty tuples don&#x27;t take space, so, 4 million of them also doesn&#x27;t take up any space.

            Oof, I have no desire to spark a language war. Every language has its warts for sure.<p>It seems strange to not provide slice.erase as a primitive operation, and instead to recommend implementing it in terms of append. Usually removing from a vector does not require allocation. Still it may be for the best with upcoming generics, fewer builtins is good.

            This is an interesting point. On the first glance, it looks like a very obvious missing piece and having to hand-write such expressions feels like unnecessary painful.<p>On the second glance, one can see why probably it was left out: there are two fundamental different ways to implement the deletion. You can copy the last element into the slot of the deleted element, or you can move all elements after the deleted one place to the left. The latter is what you implemented and preserves the ordering, which often is desirable. The former is way more efficient, if you don&#x27;t need to preserve the order. A default implementation would probably choose to preserve the order and thus introduce a systematic inefficiency which is easy to be avoided.<p>Fortunately, with the introduction of generics and especially the new slice package, this discussion becomes moot.

            It is not only hard for you, but it is also hard for a computer. And Go expresses this perfectly. 
Once you hide this behind a convenient `slice.Delete(x)`, you may end up with a codebase that bleeds performance.

            Dealing with any kind of collections will often require you to write more code than you are used to, see the other post in this thread about someone complaining about a lack of Set type. Most of these problems are due to the fact that the language doesn&#x27;t have generics yet, however generics are coming soon and once they do arrive we will have a robust collection and concurrent collection library to alleviate for most of these problems.<p>For now you just have to accept these quirks as part of the tradeoff of working with the language. I don&#x27;t find it that big of a deal esp with the solution on the horizon.

            With two years of working in Go at two companies, I have never had to write that. I can&#x27;t remember writing the equivalent in Python over even more years, either. The 99% case is building a list&#x2F;slice, not removing from one.<p>Have you ever had to remove elements from a list&#x2F;slice?

            A couple of nice tweaks that I&#x27;m happy to see.<p>I didn&#x27;t completely expect it, but I now find myself reaching for Go first when writing something like a small script or utility that I&#x27;d previously have written in something like Ruby or Python. It all feels much more solid.<p>That said… I really chafe against the anaemic type system when writing anything a larger than that. I hate not being able to communicate things like &quot;this can never be nil and if it&#x27;s is then it&#x27;s an error&quot; to the compiler. I resent having to write three lines of boilerplate every time I want to reverse a flipping 10-item slice, and the design decisions leading to the existence of `time.IsZero()` are bordering on criminal.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m the odd one out for feeling like that – parts of the language and ecosystem are just absolutely wonderful to work with, but the unergonomic sharp edges bother me so much that I end up finding it really _annoying_ to write a lot of it.

Seems like every use case for Time.IsZero() I think of is a code smell. The 1970 epoch is an implementation detail that should be hidden or configurable.

            .IsZero() is a pragmatic solution given the constraints of the system (i.e. Go language).<p>Go has a notion of &quot;zero value&quot;. When you don&#x27;t assign a value explicitly it&#x27;ll be set by the compiler to &quot;zero value&quot; of that type.<p>This is much better than C&#x2F;C++ of &quot;random value&quot;.<p>For primitive types, the compiler decides what &quot;zero value&quot; is. For structs, each component is set to its zero value.<p>For good reasons (language simplicity) Go doesn&#x27;t allow the user to declare what the zero value is (something that you can do in e.g. C++ via a constructor).<p>Time is a struct. Its zero value is the same as for any other struct and not meaningful time value.<p>It&#x27;s a pragmatic necessity to be able to query &quot;is this time value an unset time value?&quot;. A pragmatic solution for this need is to provide IsZero() method on Time struct.

            Lol Good Little Go ! :)
Still one of my favourite languages whenever &quot;heavy lifting&quot; or concurrency is required (really they make it stupidly easy).<p>Now add pattern matching please !
Well done to everyone that worked on Go ! It&#x27;s still a pleasure to use.

            Anyone seen jobs for business applications? Go seems to have a sweet spot for systems. I&#x27;d like to replace Java at my work but no one else is doing it.

            I use (and enjoy using) both Go and Java at work, and Go is in my opinion very much a Java replacement more than it is, say, a Python or C++ replacement.  It is absolutely suitable for business logic, and I&#x27;ve never been quite sure what its designers mean when they say it&#x27;s a systems language.  Yes, you can squeeze great performance out of it, but you can with Java as well.<p>The way I see it, both Go and Java are crawling towards the same ideal: a compiled, statically typed, garbage collected, modern enough program language targeted for a majority of back-end concerns.  Go has to close the gap mostly just with generics; and Java with memory layout (Valhalla), concurrency (Loom), and ergonomics (Amber); but they will both be there in 3-5 years.<p>Take this with a grain of salt if you like, but while I probably find it more fun to program in Go, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a compelling reason to switch a large codebase from Java to Go.  It often feels like my company is needlessly divided by programming languages even though they solve fairly similar problems.  It&#x27;s one thing to move off of a dying language, but Java is certainly not that.

            The difference between Java, Go and Rust is that you can teach the first two to any fresh out of school CS grad in a week or two and have them be productive.<p>Not so much with Rust.

            Rust is a great language too (I&#x27;m in the process of learning it), but I would definitely not put it in the same category as Java and Go in terms of the problems it is good at solving.  It fits much more with C&#x2F;C++.<p>There is a huge class of problems that don&#x27;t need the precision (especially around memory) that Rust demands from the programmer.

            Are you using the imports in your file? The VS Code Go addon has &quot;format on save&quot; enabled by default and Go will not compile if there are unused imports - so VS Code deletes the unused imports on save by default.<p>Otherwise try a &quot;go mod init&quot; in the root of your project.

            It&#x27;s meh for a language, it&#x27;s simple which is what they are trying to achieve but it all comes with trade offs like all programming languages. I would say a large portion of a language is how you mesh with the syntax and tooling around it.
