            This reminded me of Operation Greif, a German covert mission during WW2.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Greif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Greif</a><p><i>...German soldiers, wearing captured British and U.S. Army uniforms and using captured Allied vehicles, were to cause confusion in the rear of the Allied line.</i><p><i>Reconnaissance patrols of three or four men were to reconnoiter on both sides of the Meuse river and also pass on bogus orders to any U.S. units they met, reverse road signs, remove minefield warnings, and cordon off roads with warnings of nonexistent mines.</i><p><i>As a result, U.S. troops began asking other soldiers questions that they felt only Americans would know the answers to in order to flush out the German infiltrators, which included naming certain states&#x27; capitals, sports and trivia questions related to the U.S., etc. This practice resulted in U.S. brigadier general Bruce Clarke being held at gunpoint for some time after he incorrectly said the Chicago Cubs were in the American League[7][8][9][10] and a captain spending a week in detention after he was caught wearing German boots. General Omar Bradley was repeatedly stopped in his staff car by checkpoint guards who seemed to enjoy asking him such questions.</i><p>Is there a programmatic equivalent of asking what league the Chicago Cubs are in?

            The problem with most of these types of &quot;attacks&quot; is that they&#x27;re about the same as any other messing with roadsigns or what not. There&#x27;s no end of things you <i>could</i> do around the roads to cause crashes, but they&#x27;re all illegal and ultimately low impact.<p>This is a lot more interesting though from how it highlights the difference between current machine interpretation and human interpretation of road signs: which is to say, explainable AI is still incredibly important - the ability to slightly discolor the signs and have a blackbox AI read something entirely different means the systems and trainers we have are not cueing off a &quot;safe&quot; set of inputs to deliver their interpretations.<p>From that context, this is very interesting and important work - and I would argue also points the way to at least some basic road safety standards for self-driving systems (they should be resistant to this sort of non-human perceptible visual distortion).

            &gt; There&#x27;s no end of things you could do around the roads to cause crashes, but they&#x27;re all illegal and ultimately low impact.<p>But most of them are easy to spot, at least in the aftermath. If you spayed over a sign, people would notice. If you removed one, a driver would probably not be able to directly notice, but he might notice the situation (i.e. you should not go fast in front of a school, even when the sign is missing) or you could find evidence if an accident happens.<p>The scary thing about these signs is that they could easily go unnoticed, especially if placed well (for example a crossroad with already sun-bleached signs). Neither a driver (who could possibly intervene) or an investigator would be able to spot this, unless they&#x27;re specifically looking for it exactly.<p>Things like this are, in my opinion, also exactly why people put the bar of trust so high for autonomous vehicles: They might fail in ways totally opaque to us. You can at least somewhat estimate what a person might do [0]; for autonomous cars, this is hard or even impossible.<p>[0] I know someone could be extremely drunk or on drugs and possibly also mistake a stop sign like this, but you&#x27;d usually see some warning signs. An autonomous car might go from totally normal to batshit insane without any prior indication or apparent reason.

            &gt; Self driving cars don’t put that much emphasis on street signs,<p>They have to. Even the most accurate maps of speed limits have flaws and cannot adapt to dynamic limits. I&#x27;m pretty sure that if car makers could avoid the trouble of parsing signs, the would do so.<p>&gt; their not for example going to drive into a brick wall because of an arrow.<p>Teslas first driver death was due to the car not recognizing a white truck. It would be easy to add a fake increase in speed limit, just before a white enough wall, so that the car would not be able to brake in time once the LIDAR picks the obstacle up. To the casual observer it would look like the car just decided to accelerate into a wall.

            It feels borderline irresponsible that Tesla is visual only. Why not collect another datapoint in the form of lidar? It&#x27;s human lives at stake, don&#x27;t tell me lidar is too costly: M robot vacuum uses Lidar and the thing cost 1&#x2F;10th the price of putting leather seats on most cars today. It&#x27;s excellent, the vacuum has no issues with my white walls and it paints beautiful maps of my apartment.

            LIDAR surely wouldn&#x27;t work very well in rain though? Same problem with the RADAR - can&#x27;t see RADAR transparent objects.<p>I kind of understand where they&#x27;re coming from: a sensor where under some conditions you have to totally disregard all its input is a really bad sensor to have because your model will get disproportionately good using the &quot;good&quot; input, and then you&#x27;re still left with &quot;and in a medium drizzle we need to also work off optics only&quot;.

            Not really though right? Sensor fusion is used, and it’s a generally solved problem. We do the same thing - we have sound, touch (which can also pick up changes in air pressure, humidity, temperature, wind), visual, and internal model&#x2F;balance.<p>We’ve evolved to do that because it’s necessary for survival - sometimes we get dust in our eyes, or there is glare, or it’s too dark to see and we don’t have a light, or we’re picking up on a impending problem with something around a corner (a loud fight, or whistling wind), etc.<p>If visual sensors and LiDAR suck in the rain, radar is great. If radar sucks in crowded road or RF noisy environments, that’s when LiDAR or visual sensors are awesome.<p>Even on the road this is true - rumble strips, mechanical noise, shaking, etc.

            How though? If LIDAR is your only depth ranging input, then rain means it&#x27;s gone - there&#x27;s nothing to fuse.<p>RADAR isn&#x27;t an adequate replacement as severally crashes have demonstrated - it can&#x27;t see non metallic objects.<p>That&#x27;s the problem I think you&#x27;re glossing over: under a whole bunch of circumstances your model is operating with out an entire sense.

            I take it you have no idea how sensor fusion works?<p>Sensor fusion weighs inputs from multiple sensors, determining (roughly) which ones are ‘more wrong’ and ignoring them, to various degrees.<p>LiDAR also doesn’t just ‘not work’ at all in rain, it degrades as it gets heavier until it doesn’t work. Like vision, etc. Radar also can pick up non metallic objects, and does all the time - including geese, humans, clouds, etc, depending on frequency, and there are variable frequency radars out there that can do all sorts of cool stuff, including frequency sweeping, so it’s not just going to ‘miss’ something. There are of course issues like multipathing. But that is why sensor fusion, and similar techniques.<p>All of this adds up to something much more accurate and less prone to failure than basic vision, which is what Tesla is running now. It also costs more.

Most sudden traffic sign changes, especially those which may influence car behavior, will be manually verified and committed to the global map. Any consistent discrepancies between the model and reality will be investigated as well, especially if it causes customer complaints. And it can be followed by releasing map patches telling software to prefer the model over detection for the problematic sign. Considering that at this stage such maps will be probably integrated with government services (i.e. the map will be compared against official road data), I think such attacks on the autopilot systems will be found quite fast.

            How would that work where streets signs _do_ change suddenly? A couple of examples I see every day are roadworks (new fixed signage for the duration of the works, or even a person flipping a sign between &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;) and &quot;smart&quot; freeways&#x2F;signage (screen-based speed limit signs that change, and have additional signs for speed-limits if all screens are off). Here in AU, we also have &quot;school zones&quot; with speed limit signs that turn on only during certain times and dates.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that governments would be quick enough to keep this &quot;central roadmap&quot; correct up-to-the-minute (to be honest, I suspect that &quot;up-to-the-month&quot; would be a stretch!).

            I would assume that &quot;smart&quot; signs would transmit their state via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) network, same for roadworks (i.e. workers would mark affected zone and this state will be transmitted via a mobile battery-powered beacon). Such transmitted states will be signed, with road authority key in the root of the certificate tree, so it will be hard to spoof them (at the very least, it will be easy to identify responsible for key leaking). Of course, it assumes a proper digitalization of infrastructure and appropriate regulation changes, which is not given... But in my opinion massive adoption of full self-driving cars will be difficult without them.<p>&gt;Here in AU, we also have &quot;school zones&quot; with speed limit signs that turn on only during certain times and dates.<p>Such conditions are usually fixed and do not suddenly change. Even OSM handles them today more or less fine.

            Hmm, that would certainly be a solution. However, I&#x27;m a little dubious as to how this would work in practice. The current signage can be thrown on the back of a truck, bashed about, subjected to dirt and weather, and is really easy to use.<p>Smart signage would (likely) be more fragile, (likely) require charging or similar infrastructure, and would require configuration -- so that the sign can communicate in which direction of travel it applies and so on. Certainly not impossible hurdles to overcome, but the costs associated seem very high -- in terms of manufacture, maintenance, and training.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I suspect that we will see FSD cars operating with infrastructure likely along the lines you outline in the not-terribly-distant future -- but I suspect that they will operate within very clearly prescribed zones, like freeways and highways.

            I don&#x27;t quite follow you. Yes, we can&#x27;t prevent keys from leaking here and there, which could allow malicious actors to cause some damage, but we can reduce its impact by making keys short-term (as we do today with TLS certificates) and capability-restricted, i.e. you would not be able to change highway speed limit with a road worker key and you will not be able to use a key generated for city A in a neighboring city B. And you probably will be able to use a leaked key only once, since after an illegal usage is detected it will be quickly revoked. Plus it will be clear whose negligence has caused the leak, thus responsible people&#x2F;organizations can be held accountable, which eventually should improve cybersecurity level (at least a bit).

            That comic is fun and all, but the specific examples are things people actually do to reduce traffic speed. Painting lines that turn a two way road into a single lane for a single car length is common for low speed roads in order to force cars to take turn passing it, thus reducing speed.<p>Cutout of pedestrians is extremely common, especially in the country area where they want to remind drivers to slow down next to homes. Sometimes they wear vests to look a bit like traffic police, through that practice is a bit (more?) illegal.<p>If I remember right, when that comic came out there was a HN thread discussing exactly those things. Those tricks are not done in order to murder people, but they might confuse a computer.

            There are cases where pranksters painted a road on a wall, and drivers were fooled by it.

            It makes a massive difference. To the human eye, the altered sign is not really distinguishable from the normal one and the attackers don&#x27;t need to approach the sign in order to alter it. It makes a remote attack scenario quite achievable (depending on signal strength required for the laser etc). Think people camped out in a hotel room over looking a freeway and causing Telsas all to crash.

            They would have to be signed including GPS coordinates, otherwise they would be vulnerable to a replay attack.  And since GPS is not that precise, you would still be able to, say, take two nearby signs and switch them.

            And of course the obvious problem of how you would keep the signing key private over time. Road signs are made by many companies working for every level of government from the national level down to individual municipalities. Centralise the generation of QR-codes?<p>Great single point of failure there, and now any sign placed temporarily because of unforeseen events (flooding, bridge collapse, etc.) won&#x27;t be acknowledged by the autonomous car because it lacks a valid QR-code.

            The QR code is just a hash of the information on the sign to confirm that the system is reading the sign correctly. If someone actually puts up an incorrect sign, it would be immediately apparent to humans.<p>If you really wanted a secure system you&#x27;d just have a database of all the signs in an area that cars could access (for example if I know what road i&#x27;m on, and my approximate location on that road, I should be able to look up what the speed limit on this stretch of road is).<p>The fact is if you want to be able to stop a car from going over a bridge that&#x27;s collapsed by placing a sign in front of it, inevitably the same system can prevent a car from going over a bridge that hasn&#x27;t collapsed. Realistically, unexpected road signs should prompt manual operation.

            &gt; It&#x27;s practically impossible to forge those,...<p>Forging isn&#x27;t necessary, just copying one that is inappropriate in a particular setting.<p>Forgery isn&#x27;t difficult either if the QR code isn&#x27;t signed. QR codes are standardized and software to generate any QR code is reasonably straightforward to write (one has to know a bit about Reed-Solomon error correction), but writing software isn&#x27;t necessary because there are a number of easily available libraries that can be used to generate QR codes.<p>Cryptographically signed QR codes (which I believe are what you are talking about) would need to include location data that could be verified by the vehicle, such as GPS coordinates and the sign&#x27;s facing direction. This might work, but of course the logistics could be difficult in practice. Since signs aren&#x27;t on the internet, it would be impossible to update them whenever a signing key was compromised. Key compromises would probably happen because signs are manufactured all over the world.

            Luckily the tesla autopilot ignores speed limits on the high-way, it only follows it (when on auto pilot) on slower roads.<p>There have however been issues with e-trons and id.X cars reading side street signs here in Norway and braking hard on the highway.

            Academically certainly interesting, but everything I&#x27;ve seen on adversarial attacks against ML models relies on knowing the model or having a way to run the model against attacker-determined input.<p>How would one go and attack a real-world vehicle?

            This title doesn&#x27;t even begin to scratch the surface of what this is capable of. A much more viable (and damaging) attack would be encoding &quot;invisible&quot; data onto a widely-shared photo, and then manipulating it to trip the CSAM filters for the respective platforms. These attacks are designed to be invisible in real-world applications, but I can imagine a similar implementation designed to be invisible to humans (eg. encoding important data as two seemingly identical colors, or manipulating dither patterns).<p>Stuff like this is why we can&#x27;t trust AI. That doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t use it, but most of our models are black-boxes that can only be &quot;debugged&quot; as much as a pizza can be &quot;decooked&quot;

            <i>Is a stop sign really the same shape and colour as a speed limit sign in the USA?</i><p>No, but some of these sign reading algorithms probably don&#x27;t take color and shape into account. A naive implementation might first checks the sign for something that can be OCRed, and if it finds that that is a 2 digit number that matches known speed limits then it&#x27;s a speed limit.

            Seems like a bad idea in hindsight! Any system like this should be considering multiple factors, including the shape and size, as well as evaluating the behaviour of other drivers to see if the perceived instruction seems reasonable. After all, that&#x27;s what we do as humans.

            One of the core problems with machine learning is that we often don&#x27;t really know why the model does what it does.  We train the neural network on 100000 images of road sign, 5000 of which are stop signs and we know it will identify stop signs, but we don&#x27;t know what it is that makes the algorithm think something actually is a Stop sign. Is it the color, the shape, the word &quot;Stop&quot;?<p>The training set had red octagonal signs and signs with numbers, but no red octagonal signs with numbers. Since the the model had never seen a sign with just two big digits that wasn&#x27;t a speed limit sign it decides that the numbers was more significant than the shape or color and went with that.<p>What this shows is how important it is to include intentionally adversarial data in your training set if you want your model to be robust in &#x27;unexpected&#x27; situations.
