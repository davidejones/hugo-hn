            The most used app on my Android phone is an RSS reader. It has feeds including: Hacker News, the BBC, Reddit, The Register, Computer Weekly, Wired and a couple of retro computer Google groups. The latter stopped updating on 26th July, but everything else gives me all the news and info I want in a single place without having to install numerous dedicated apps or trawl through multiple Web sites - it&#x27;s just a great app and service.<p>According to the Play store, the app I use has &quot;100,000+ downloads&quot; which hardly points to a dead ecosystem.<p>Stupid Google.

            &gt; According to the Play store, the app I use has &quot;100,000+ downloads&quot; which hardly points to a dead ecosystem.<p>But that is far away from Google-Scale. Anything under 5-10 million is likely not in googles eye.<p>But I think the actual problem with google and rss is the isolation of users choice that google seems to dislike. Google is strong on AI-assisting the users. They seem to prefer giving the people tools which guide them and learn the choices of the user, instead of letting the user choose themself. And RSS is a big obstacle for this as it&#x27;s outside their control.

            There&#x27;s no problem in principle to monetising RSS data by sticking ads into the stream. The real problem for Google is (I suspect) that it is a standard protocol, so enables anybody to play, and that means <i>escape from Google&#x27;s walled garden</i>. In a fit of Apple-envy, and lacking any imagination, Google (and MS) seem to have opted for trying to enforce a walled-garden panopticon as their means to profit, and in that view of the world, RSS -- and, indeed, any other standard protocol -- must die.

            RSS isn&#x27;t easily surveilled. RSS apps download feeds but that doesn&#x27;t mean an eyeball could have seen any particular item. You could do custom trackable links and charge for clicks, but charging for impressions would be much harder.<p>Are there other Google ad properties that work that way?

            Podcasts are largely distributed via RSS, and it’s a blossoming advertising market.<p>Some services offer to splice audio segments with “current” ads, so that even older content can bring in new ad revenue, if I remember correctly.<p>You can do ads with RSS, it’s just not as lucrative because the market is small and harder to sell than standard web properties.

            It&#x27;s not that it &quot;must die&quot;, there&#x27;s just no incentive for Google to keep it around. It&#x27;s just a cost tagged on to maintenance of Google Groups which can be cost without any major downsides (from Googles perspective).<p>It&#x27;s more surprising that they haven&#x27;t killed Google Groups completely.

            The RSS feed on YouTube also vanished for a several hours late last night.<p>When it happened I was afraid it was gone for good.  The feeds showed back up, but it really feels any feature of a site like YouTube or whatever that lets me consume content without being guided by a website designed to keep me engaged for as long as possible is doomed these days.

            Would you pay for a service that showed you an RSS-style feed of people you care to follow on various platforms (youtube, twitch, patreon, etc)? At this point it seems like the promise of an algo-free multi-channel feed from creators people care about could actually be a good startup, and maybe <i>that</i> thing could produce an RSS feed (incentives would be aligned to do so).

            Hmmmmmmnnn that&#x27;s super interesting. So unfortunately that flirts with a ToS violation-ish (of course youtube-dl is allowed to exist but maybe questionable to build on, public information is allowed scrapable via the linkedin decision, etc), but this implies that:<p>- Youtube is a must-have platform for you (one of the big offenders for sure, I had them in my notes on this idea)<p>- Being able to download the content is ideal.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking that maybe if the content creator has the option to manage their page and upload their own content that would be a nice way to handle it. Not that I want to play the video hosting game but having access to the original content would make it much easier to distribute.<p>The question of who pays is interesting though.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind, email (see bio) me a way to contact you (something ephemeral if you&#x27;d like, twitter, whatever is most comfortable) and I&#x27;ll see if I can whip something together for you to beta test.

            Given that RSS eschewed XML &amp; specifically XML namespaces for so long, the idea that RSS ever would have called itself RDF is hilarious to me.<p>Part of the whole reason Atom (RFC4287) was began was because embedding content inside RSS was a shit show, a disaster, because while it sort of looked like XML and said xml at the top (maybe), the lack of namespaces meant it wasn&#x27;t safely extensible &amp; putting rich content inside was a huge mixed bag. RDF on the other hand has always been about flexibility &amp; namespaces, about rich data.<p>Killedbygoogle.com is a good reference, for sure, but this is kind of higher level anti-internet anti-protocols anti-standardization sabotage. This isn&#x27;t just abandoned product, this is degrading &amp; reducing what used to be a protocol-centric world of newsgroups to a captive, isolated product.<p>Oh! The plot thickens! TIL RSS 2.0.1 actually got explicit namespace support! Wikipedia:<p>&gt; <i>RSS 2.0.1 has the internal version number 2.0. RSS 2.0.1 was proclaimed to be &quot;frozen&quot;, but still updated shortly after release without changing the version number. RSS now stood for Really Simple Syndication. The major change in this version is an explicit extension mechanism using XML namespaces</i>

            RDF was used early on by a lot of sites before moving to one of the later RSS specs. The <i>Simple</i> in RSS was a reaction to the perceived (and actual) complexity of RDF.

            There was a schism in the RSS 0.x days. 2.0 is Really Simple Syndication and has a looser approach; RSS 1.0 is RDF Site Summary and tightens things up. Really, if you’re going to generate feeds, you should use Atom or JSON Feed these days. Too much baggage with RSS that makes it difficult to parse unambiguously.

            RSS has a complicated history, but the versions you’re most likely most familiar with are maintained by the RSS Advisory Board and state definitively: “Its name is an acronym for Really Simple Syndication.”<p>That said, this is in fact a backronym created when Dave Winer rolled RSS 2.0 out. Check out this link[1] and ask yourself, what happened to RSS 1.0? You could start at the RSS Wikipedia page to investigate further if you’re interested.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rssboard.org&#x2F;rss-change-notes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rssboard.org&#x2F;rss-change-notes</a>

            I think it&#x27;s the other way around; Really Simple Syndication is a backronym - for every other historical explanation, I can&#x27;t see an acronym like being created in the early days of the internet. Once it took hold&#x2F;potential realised, it needed to be translated to less technical folks.

            Perhaps renaming it to something other than &quot;Really Simple&quot; is the first step toward the people paid from online ads and web commercialisation to start adding complexity.<p>Surprised I never saw anyone try to inject ads into RSS feeds. Or maybe they did and I never saw it.<p>Also, the idea of &quot;syndication&quot; seems counter to Google&#x27;s survival. If we can discover the contents of web pages through automated means via RSS, then the need for people to manually submit &quot;searches&quot; to a single company who &quot;crawls&quot; the web and provides &quot;search&quot; seems less vital. How much data about users can be collected from RSS feed subscriptions. If it does not produce lots of data about users, then it&#x27;s not worth much to many &quot;tech&quot; companies, including Google. Users can navigate from RSS feeds directly to website pages, bypassing these &quot;tech&quot; middleman companies.

Daring Fireball is a well known example that sells the advertising spot in the open: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daringfireball.net&#x2F;feeds&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daringfireball.net&#x2F;feeds&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;</a><p>If you’re talking about ads in the body of each entry, I’ve seen that too but can’t give an example off the top of my head. That said, it’s more common for publications to give you a small excerpt instead to lure you back into the ad-laden web page.

            Hopefully this is just a mistake and not a real deprecation.<p>That being said, a little while back when controversy popped up over Chrome&#x27;s handling of `alert()`, there were multiple Google engineers I saw online in various settings talking about how the web developer community needed to take some responsibility to monitor upcoming changes and discussions. I do want to bring up that a good way to encourage that is to have an easy, standardized way to subscribe to these content feeds using any client, using a technology that can be aggregated and curated by 3rd parties, that is easily parseable so that it can be searched and transformed by other programs, and that doesn&#x27;t require an account to access.<p>Just a thought for anyone on the Chrome&#x2F;Google team that is actually interested in improving communication channels with web developers.

            Google groups feels (UX &amp; support wise) like one of those products that should have already been killed by Google. One of the reasons why Groups has survived so long must be Google&#x27;s reluctance to give proper customer support for most of their products. Google groups is the only customer support you will get in many cases.

            I think part of it might be nostalgia as well. If they kill google groups then they are killing yet another part of the old internet they sought to embrace and improve upon but the bean counters have mostly taken over and only a few holdouts in upper management keep this sort of stuff alive.

            News feeds (RSS&#x2F;Atom) are a fabulous technology. They’re not dead but this is the most recent cut in the killing of the Open Web with “death by a thousand cuts”¹.<p>After the killing of Google Reader, the really big blow was when Mozilla (the closest we have to a “champion for the open web”) removed the built-in feed preview feature and subscription UI from Firefox 64²³.  While this wasn’t a major problem for users like me who can install an add-on, it meant that the discoverability of news feeds was no longer there.<p>This followed the trend over the past decade for web publishers to hide or not make it obvious that news feeds are available, e.g., many WordPress blogs automatically make news feeds available but unless the reader knows (from experience) about news feeds, there’s no obvious way to discover that they’re available.<p>All these changes will mean that new users of the Web will never know that news feeds exist – other than the restricted feeds provided by the walled gardens of large corporations – and the number of news feed users will continue to shrink.<p>Twenty years ago, when Microsoft were the large corporation trying to kill open web protocols and protocols (and Google weren’t evil), influential web developers and designers such as Jeffrey Zeldman banded together to create the Web Standards Project⁴⁵ to promote the openness and accessibility of the Web. They were largely successful in this goal (and closed shop in 2010) but without the existence of some organisation that keeps up this sort of advocacy, it will be the large corporations who control the direction and pace of change of the Web. This will be in the interests of their own profits – not the users.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lingchi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lingchi</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;64.0&#x2F;releasenotes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;64.0&#x2F;releasenotes&#x2F;</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gijsk.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;firefox-removes-core-product-support-for-rss-atom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gijsk.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;firefox-removes-core-prod...</a> feeds&#x2F;<p>4. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webstandards.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webstandards.org&#x2F;</a><p>5. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Web_Standards_Project" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Web_Standards_Project</a>

            &gt; <i>Firefox 64²³</i><p>How long have I been asleep?!?<p>More seriously, i agree with most of your post but the removal of feed support in Firefox is imo no worse than the removal of ftp or gopher support. These things don&#x27;t belong in a modern browser, were mostly unused, can be moved to a separate client, and the Firefox support sucked in the first place... The actual users were already using separate clients.

            It&#x27;s tiring to argue with people who think RSS is dead so I just stopped. People who appreciate RSS still use it, those who provide it know their users&#x2F;readers like it. Most Swedish news websites, TV, and radio still provide RSS. BBC provides RSS. Most blogs I follow provide RSS. If you really think about it there are only a few (but huge) companies that don&#x27;t provide it, honestly, fuck&#x27;em.<p>The most beautiful thing about open standards is that they never ever die. There are gopher services (and revitalization attempts) all around.<p>If you think RSS is dead. Keep thinking that, it&#x27;s your loss.

            Google tries to kill RSS for a long time, that&#x27;s it.<p>TBH, I understand why - using RSS you don&#x27;t need &quot;help&quot; from Google to decide what you want to see and what don&#x27;t want.<p>As for myself, after I installed Miniflux I removed accounts on reddit and other &quot;content sources&quot;, because I simply read 99% of content through RSS and as someone already mentioned here in comments, RSS reader is the most used app on my phone now.

            Although the title is correct because it speaks of killing &quot;support&quot; for RSS, these kind of titles about tech giants &#x27;killing&#x27; all kinds of stuff make me laugh. Saying that Google is killing RSS is like saying a gazelle running away from a lion is at the same time killing that lion. :&#x27;) I don&#x27;t think it works like that.

            I honestly don&#x27;t understand google&#x27;s attitude towards rss. Wouldn&#x27;t it be in their interest to support it? The alternative is twitter, and if everyone uses twitter, you might as well search twitter to learn what&#x27;s happening, rather then the web.

            It&#x27;s probably more because Google has an almost pathological aversion to maintaining anything. You don&#x27;t get the cool projects, raises and promotions by doing the journeyman work of maintaining, fixing bugs, listening to users and gradually improving an app or service.

            This is a guess, but I reckon Alphabet has a little over 50,000 members of engineering staff (135,000 total, roughly 40% engineers).

It works, it does its job, it doesn&#x27;t need to be changed.<p>When something like this &quot;just works&quot; it&#x27;s easy to fall victim to the belief that it&#x27;s irrelevant, but that&#x27;s just because it exists in the background.<p>I sincerely hope you will not remove RSS support because it&#x27;s an easy way to monitor publicly visible updates from all kinds of sites without needing to implement their APIs. I&#x27;ve got a bot that monitors Youtube accounts via RSS and posts updates to a Discord. Writing the code took only about a half hour because parsing RSS feeds is literally a single call to a library.<p>To me, RSS&#x2F;Atom is one of the original promises of the web: a freely accessible network of information from all over the world in a standardized open format that anyone can use. Takes practically zero time to implement because libraries will do the work for you. @intenttoship is already lamenting the fact they&#x27;re going to have to write a screen scraper now.

            Googler: RSS is effectively dead.<p>Translation: Google is killing RSS in its products so you have to either go to their ad&#x2F;tracker infested sites, or download an app geared towards tracking and spying on you for the purpose of advertisement; and pretending this means RSS is dead.

            I&#x27;m afraid they mean it in the sense of &quot;popular use of the protocol&quot;. I&#x27;m on Firefox right now, navigate to my personal blog that offers RSS... And none of the buttons in the UI seems to refer to that. If I navigate directly to the RSS, it just shows me the XML. Back in the day, I&#x27;d have a button in the URL bar to do something with it.<p>So, when I work at Google, I don&#x27;t see any mention of RSS anywhere. It just isn&#x27;t a thing users would demand. There might be semi-forgotten API endpoints here and there. But I assure you - when the server inevitably gets hit by some deprecation or its team gets reorged enough, it will be rewritten. And the rewrite will almost surely not have such an endpoint, simply because nobody will ever think of it. No vendetta, just lifecycle.

            The vast majority of RSS support seems to be an accident or it just happens to work because of the software they use. That is a pretty fragile state to be in since they are a redesign or software switch away from breaking and removing support. And they will not put in any effort to fix it since it was never intentionally a feature of the site.

            &gt; Most of the people working on software these days barely know what RSS is<p>Using my experience from a Polish university from a field of study focused on computer science: Most of my acquaintances know what RSS is. Several of them use it, and way more at least tried. Granted, it is not something nearly as popular as Facebook, Discord or other similar software, but to say no one know exactly what RSS is seems unlikely to me. Maybe it is simply a situation around your peers? Seeing that even Vivaldi browser added built-in RSS support lately, it seems that people that remember RSS are still common enough.
