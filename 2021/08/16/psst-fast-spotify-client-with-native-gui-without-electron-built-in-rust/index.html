            What&#x27;s funny about having to rely on unauthorized clones to provide a fast native UX was that Spotify&#x27;s original client back in 2008 started out as beautifully light, custom rendered native client.<p>Few Apps ever had that wow factor the first time I used it, it was so much lighter and more responsive than anything else of the day. I remember being perplexed at how I could search and skip to any part of a song quicker than iTunes could looking at a local library. Everything was latency-free and instantaneous.<p>We were building a Music Startup at the time, so we investigated how it worked. We we’re very surprised we couldn’t find any evidence of an established UI toolkit. It looked as though they had built their own custom UI renderer and optimized TCP protocol which sent back its metadata in XML. Their traffic looked like it was initially seeded from their own (or CDN) servers (for best latency) and then overtime we would see some P2P traffic on the wire.<p>Our QT&#x2F;C++ client had decent performance but was noticeably heavier than Spotify&#x27;s. I was disappointed to see their native client eventually be abandoned and succumb to become yet another Chromium wrapper. I expect it fell to the pressures of a growing startup adding 100s of developers (without the skill of their original CTO&#x2F;devs) where a native UI couldn&#x27;t be updated and re-iterated as fast as a Web App. I wish they maintained 2 desktop clients, and left their native client alone to just be an audio player and push all their new social features to their new flagship CEF app.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate the skill and desire of building fast native UIs are being lost to Electron and CEF wrappers. Seems the larger the organization the more likely they are to build new Web rendered Desktop Apps and we have to rely on unauthorized Indie efforts like this for fast, responsive native UIs.

            Something that Chromium apps do give you however, for free for the most part, is accessibility. I just tried the GUI version of this client and was not surprised to find out that I could not use it.
The new Spotify UI released a few months ago is the most accessible Spotify has ever been. Landmarks, clear labels, headings, and even aria-trickery to automatically announce things using my screen reader. I remember being very frustrated with the old UI&#x27;s to the point where I chose another service just because it was more accessible, even if it didn&#x27;t have a desktop app. YouTube Music and Deezer had much better UI&#x27;s from the get go.
At this point, I&#x27;m almost happy to see an Electron app. It doesn&#x27;t guarantee accessibility, but the likelyhood is so, so, so much higher than any modern cross-platform UI framework.
I&#x27;d almost go as far as to not call these UI&#x27;s native. Because if they were, if they used native controls, the accessibility would be there. The OS vendors spend a lot of time to make them usable and consistent. Sadly, these UI frameworks don&#x27;t, or can&#x27;t.
Sure, psst has a CLI, but I only get panics. I can&#x27;t do -h to find out what I can do with it, I can only call it with a spotify URL and get it to play and exit once it&#x27;s done. It feels like the cli was included as a sort of testing tool to check the underlying libs and code, and not as a usable version of the app itself - but it&#x27;s still very early in development so the GUI might be the same. I can&#x27;t tell.

            Here&#x27;s how these things usually go: first, you start small. You build something you can show other people. You try to generate some traction and build interest around your idea, validating it at a very small scale (friends, family, &quot;Show HN&quot;, etc). You gradually expand that cycle of people. You get into a routine of iterating on improvements, adding new features, and gradually scaling things up. You probably get a couple of people to join you on that journey, because the more popular your product becomes - the more asks you&#x27;ll be getting, and the more work it takes to scale it out. Rinse and repeat.<p>The reality is that we can&#x27;t expect every single hobby project to support every single use-case from day one. Painfully for all - the current state of things in this space is such that building accessibility into your product is not trivial and hence it gets postponed &quot;for later&quot;.<p>Now, on to a completely honest question: why don&#x27;t we have screen readers that can consistently translate the &quot;visual&quot; version to a version people with visibility impairments can understand in a more generic manner, without requiring every single piece of software to adjust itself to every single flavor of a screen reader? I&#x27;m honestly asking why can&#x27;t we solve the whole problem by offloading it to the screen reader itself. Can we solve this by simply offering a text-only command-line like version of every product? (ie. as opposed to building &quot;beautiful&quot;&#x2F;&quot;designed&quot; experiences that get downsampled by the screen-reader anyways)? Sort of like building a sitemap.xml file that lets the user with a screen reader do everything a user with the full-blown GUI can. Sounds like an opportunity to create a cross-industry standard?<p>Edit: getting downvoted for comments like this is why I&#x27;m honestly considering just closing my account and not participating in any more such conversations going forward.

            I upvoted you to combat your downvote because your initial paragraphs was a very reasonable description of the journey of a lot of hobby projects and its unreasonable to expect alpha apps (built using a GUI FX in active development) racing to get out an MVP is going to have accessibility nailed out of the gate.<p>Your last paragraph for a magic screen reader is that it simply doesn&#x27;t exist, so in its absence you need to use a GUI FX that supports accessibility for it to be accessible. If all the screen reader can see is a rendered bitmap they&#x27;re not going to be able to identify what&#x27;s a UI control or how to interact with it, which group of pixels is decorative and which is functional or how it will be able to determine the difference between a real App and a screenshot of it? With the recent real-time AI powering &quot;copy text from image&quot; maybe a generic reader is going to be more advanced than what&#x27;s historically been possible.<p>But I don&#x27;t really know how screen readers work, I&#x27;m assuming they need to work in tandem with GUI FX&#x27;s which is able to describe the purpose and roles of its different UI elements, so if you use native OS controls it&#x27;s going to be able to know how to inspect different controls of running Apps and how to send events to them.

            I read your comment and agree. Without thinking it through, it seems that if every program provided a full CLI and a sitemap like file, then a screenreader should be able to integrate with said program.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about the accessibility business, but my impression is that the screenreaders are all very expensive. Maybe providing a universal interface as described would level the playing field, maybe that&#x27;s not desired (by the big brands).

            This is an interesting idea for app-interoperability in general. It brings to mind Apple Automator, which I have no idea how works, but can sometimes be used to make Apps interoperate. It&#x27;d be pretty cool if every app did have a sitemap-like API spec that that mapped out the core of the app, and the UI sat on top of that.

            Exactly.<p>We should decouple the core of the application from the UI. Have a standardized interface which exposes all available functionality to the screen reader and allows it to talk to the core directly, bypassing the UI.<p>Stop doing what everybody does today: stop having screen reader depend on the UI (ie. aria-labels, etc). This problem can&#x27;t be solved by adding &quot;decorations&quot; to existing UI components. It&#x27;s best solved by exposing an entirely separate interface which lets screen readers (and other hardware) interact with the core of the application directly.<p>This sounds like a spec, a set of language frameworks and a design pattern waiting to be written.

            If it&#x27;s done right and standardized it&#x27;d be worth it for everybody since even people who don&#x27;t need accessibility features could then create their own interfaces to the programs they use customized for their preferences and workflow

            A lot of the UI scripting on macOS is accomplished via accessibility APIs. If you’re interested, check out Accessibility Inspector[0], which ships with Xcode. You can inspect macOS applications in a similar, albeit much more limited way to a web browser’s interactive inspect element function.<p>You can also accomplish UI scripting via C&#x2F;ObjC&#x2F;Swift using the Application Services framework [1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;archive&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;Accessibility&#x2F;Conceptual&#x2F;AccessibilityMacOSX&#x2F;OSXAXTestingApps.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;archive&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;Ac...</a>

            FWIW, the oldest accessibility API was Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), which was added to Windows 95 in a service pack in 1997. Classic MacOS never had an accessibility API; the Outspoken screen reader for that OS had to rely exclusively on ugly hacks (e.g. patching Toolbox functions). OS X introduced accessibility APIs for Carbon and Cocoa in an early version; not sure which one. Unix-based desktop environments got an accessibility API, AT-SPI (thank you Sun), in the early 2000s.

            Hi, the author here. Psst is definitely in alpha, and the CLI is indeed just an example (it&#x27;s what I was using to test the core mechanisms). I&#x27;m sorry the accessibility is so bad now, but Druid, the GUI library, takes it very seriously -- which is not very common in custom GUI frameworks. So, fingers crossed, it should get better soon.<p>Re. command-line Spotify clients, there is ncspot[1] and spotify-tui[2], and if you use Linux, Spot[3] looks like a nice GTK experience.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hrkfdn&#x2F;ncspot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hrkfdn&#x2F;ncspot</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Rigellute&#x2F;spotify-tui" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Rigellute&#x2F;spotify-tui</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xou816&#x2F;spot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xou816&#x2F;spot</a>

            This is, unfortunately, a very common occurrence when GUI frameworks are concerned. For some  reason, framework authors like to mislead and say that their framework is native, when it looks native but actually isn&#x27;t. WX and SWT are the two notable exceptions here, they do indeed use native OS controls.<p>If you want to use a native GUI framework because of accessibility, check if it&#x27;s as native as it claims.

            Your analogy doesn&#x27;t make sense since I&#x27;m paying the same amount either way - so of course I&#x27;ll choose the Saturn V.<p>Perhaps a better analogy would be whether you want a fast but fragile  kit car missing some features, or a well-built but slower caravan.

            I honestly think we need to rethink accessibility from the ground up. modern advances in OCR and machine learning should allow us to do accessibility entirely from the GPU output.<p>it&#x27;d take awhile to perfect but i think it&#x27;d ease the burden tremendously for software developers and those who need accessibility.

            &gt; it&#x27;d take awhile to perfect<p>Some of us can&#x27;t wait. That&#x27;s why I, for one, continue to advocate for developers to make their applications accessible with the currently available tools. It&#x27;s also why I&#x27;m trying, with my AccessKit [1] project (which admittedly is taking time to get off the ground), to make it easier for GUI toolkits to implement the current baroque platform accessibility APIs.<p>I&#x27;m also reluctant to concede that we&#x27;re doomed to reconstruct UI content and semantics probabilistically from pixels, when that information is already there somewhere in the app. But it may be the best long-term solution to the <i>social</i> problem of trying to get everyone to implement accessibility.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AccessKit&#x2F;accesskit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AccessKit&#x2F;accesskit</a>

            You&#x27;re onto something here. As long as accessibility is the job of the developer, software accessibility will reamin &quot;on the roadmap&quot; for many projects. There&#x27;s simply too much to learn, too many battles to fight, and accessibility tends to offer to little obvious and immediate value compared to other priorities.<p>Legislation is not really the answer, or we&#x27;d already have great accessibility.<p>In other areas, we&#x27;ve automated and outsourced it - CI&#x2F;CD, security, infrastructure. Think how hard it was to manage an RDBMS cluster or version control repository 20 years ago, and now even a junior developer is able to have both within minutes. We have frameworks like React.<p>In that time, accessibility has actually got harder, because of more devices, technologies, network connections, and more people with a wider range of accessibility needs.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what it would look like. Maybe a new way of rendering content, maybe a new framework that puts accessibility as a first-class concept.

            Just finished listening to this, thanks for the recommendation.<p>They spend some time interviewing Lars Ulrich of Metallica in the context of of the Napster lawsuit. He comes across in this interview as still upset at Napster for what they did, and he is at turns indignant and also emotionally wounded at the fact that they are perceived as the villains in the story. In particular he cannot seem to reconcile his belief that they, and I quote &quot;are the most fan friendly band on this planet&quot; with suing Napster for $100k per download in damages, a ludicrous and arrogant sum. I am not a Metallica fan and do not listen to their music (out of disinterest, not antifandom. Metal isn&#x27;t my genre), but it is striking to me to see how 20 years on they still don&#x27;t get it.

            I watched a documentary they made about themselves... Only went there because two band colleagues ask me if i wanna come.

            Ulrich took it personally, thinking it was somebody stealing from him.

            Anything that qualitatively changes what survival means to us, will change someone. For good, bad, indifferent.

He told me, &quot;You are still going to have problems, they are just going to be different problems.&quot;<p>Each of our moral outlooks, stability, suitability for state of life, relatability, etc., is heavily dependent on our relationship with our survival environment.

            Thanks! It&#x27;s great to read the backstory of how the original Spotify client came to be:<p>&gt; &quot;Not to go into too much detail here, but at the time, most of the internet was made up of “thin clients,” like web pages or Flash-based clients that ran in-browser, and used more traditional, standardized protocols like HTTPS. Seeing the limitations of that, Ludde and a team of engineers ran in the exact opposite direction, creating a stand-alone “fat client,” building entirely new protocols and hybridizing client-server and P2P technology to suit their own ends. (Check out Episode 01, “How do you steal from a pirate?”, to hear more of that nitty-gritty stuff about persistent TCP connections and how our P2P implementation saved us bandwidth cost.) It was only by rethinking every layer of our infrastructure that we were able to pull Spotify off, to create that magic moment of double-clicking on a new song and having it instantly play. And speaking of magic …&quot;<p>Having been an early user of the beta I presumed it had to be driven by people with this mindset from rethinking everything from bottom up to provide the best UX possible, would really love to read more about the technology used in the original Desktop client?<p>EDIT: Currently listening to “How do you steal from a pirate?” which is providing a more detailed backstory on the origins of Spotify:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;episode&#x2F;1jHRUXkeiUh44CK4KZQb0h?si=d8695b5f4e58491c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;episode&#x2F;1jHRUXkeiUh44CK4KZQb0h?si=d...</a><p>Sounds like Ludde Strigeus, the creator of µTorrent was the key hire to make the original Desktop Client UX possible whose Desktop &amp; P2P expertise was able to convince the rest of dev team to go down the path they did. Some interesting insights, they used Ogg Vorbis instead of mp3 using a custom designed TCP protocol because they were better able to strip packet bits down to transport just the audio bits required for playback.<p>&gt; Michelle: The thing that happened that was kind of pure magic in that meeting was that [Daniel] did a comparison. He started playing a song on the software, and the song played so quick, so instant … I mean, I don’t know if people remember, but playback was slow back then. Even if you had an MP3 on your computer, and you played it via, you know, Winamp, iTunes, this was faster. And we were like, “You have the files on your computer, right?” And he was like, “No, it’s in the cloud.”<p>I had the same initial experience where I was blown away at how instant and responsive it was, at first I didn&#x27;t believe it and thought it was doing some sort of pre-caching magic where it&#x27;d start downloading before selecting each song. So ran lots of tests where I did first time searches and immediately scroll to songs down the list of search results (to bypass any caches) and could see that it was indeed pulling traffic in real-time, the time from click&#x2F;scrubbing to audio playing was just unbelievably fast.

            Yes, I miss this so much, I actually stopped using Spotify about 6 years ago.

            I guess much that did the first client light weight was because it was developed by Ludvig Strigeus. He devloped the very light and popular uTorrent client. Very early for Spotify they bought uTorrent AB, not for the uTorrent client, but because they wanted his skills and he was the person that developed the first Spotify client. A few month later Spotify sold the uTorrent client to Torrent Inc.<p>Ludvig Strigeus is a skilled developer and have got many awards, like the Polhem Prize which is a Swedish award for a high-level technological innovation or an ingenious solution to a technical problem. If I recall correctly, he is very good at writing very small and optimized c++ programs, but the code is very hard for others to understand and maintain. So I guess when Spotify become bigger and more developer needed to work with the code they needed a more &quot;main stream&quot; solution and had to abandon the first client.

            The early versions of uTorrent were on the order of 80KB in size, it really was amazing. BitTorrent the company re-skinned it as BitTorrent the software and offered both versions for a few years, differing only by icons and colors, but fans held to strong opinions about which was technically better.
It is true that the code was hard to maintain and extend though.

            The problem (or rather value proposition) is that the only thing that matters is the end-user&#x27;s perceived value, and that&#x27;s almost always in the form of features and stability. Most people don&#x27;t care that it takes an extra 10-100 milliseconds for the UI to react compared to a native app, especially given they just want to listen to music, which the app does just fine. If people specifically don&#x27;t like the social features, they&#x27;ll be mad at the decision to implement those social features instead of &#x27;what they used for the tech stack&#x27; since ultimately Spotify could have developed the same features in a native app with just a few extra weeks of sprint, if that.

            The outrage around these supposedly egregious performance issues is more understandable when you consider that developers who spend a lot of time tuning performance in their work would naturally develop a &#x27;selective attention bias,&#x27; magnifying the significance of what to others are negligible if not imperceptible differences.<p>Imagine the frustration of someone who, for example, did work on sound insulation for cooling systems: they sit out on a patio for dinner with friends and the sound of an inexpertly designed air conditioner appears to them as intolerably intrusive; meanwhile, no one else at the meal notices until it&#x27;s pointed out.

            I can only share my experience. I used Spotify for the first time in 2011. It completely defied what I thought was possible with music streaming.<p>Songs would play immediately. It was faster than iTunes. I believe Spotify is still faster than Apple Music.<p>This was at a time when I had no expectation that my smartphone&#x27;s internet was fast enough to do much of anything. It was so impressive, that I became a paying customer and have been a paying Spotify customer for 10 years.<p>And Spotify pulls a lot of annoying bullshit. They have a habit of treating their users like shit in various ways - you pay and don&#x27;t get ads in between songs, but they still spam pop ups and try to direct your behavior in various ways. It feels like their attitude towards you as a user is very much influenced by the &quot;free tier&quot; even if you&#x27;re a paying customer.<p>Their various app UIs have suffered greatly over the years (current incarnation is mostly tolerable)<p>But the base thing they do - play music faster than any other service is what has kept me. I also don&#x27;t think it is ethical that Apple can offer a competing service, while forcing Spotify to give up a significant cut of its revenue. I think it should be illegal, so I likely would never pay for Apple Music because of that.

            In terms of running a business, surely user satisfaction and business goals are much more directly relevant than performance in and of itself, except insofar it contributes to the former? So it&#x27;s not surprising to me that you&#x27;d see a lot of that sentiment on a forum hosted by a startup accelerator, nor that it&#x27;s what for-profit organizations optimize for. That doesn&#x27;t mean that people can&#x27;t also have an appreciation for well-performing or technically brilliant code.

            The imperceptible becomes perceptible when you make it noticeably more perceptible. A better point would be to not even show the user what they are missing out on, because then that will be the standard.

            Absolutely. Anyone building on top of performance critical systems should have a healthy bit of gratitude for the engineers who were interested to specialize there.<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s good to remain as objective as possible about the <i>actual</i> impact of optimizing for performance in different domains.<p>So for instance, the impact of attention paid to performance in the codecs used by a music&#x2F;video player, or the v8 runtime, or rendering or networking subsystems in e.g. macOS or Chromium is huge.<p>However, should we expect the impact of optimizing to be similar in application-level code for consumer apps? I would argue no (granting that exceptions exist). At this layer the computations are for business and display logic, and calling into highly performant subsystems. Additionally, they are typically &#x27;leaves,&#x27; not dependencies of other systems (which would cause their performance choices to ramify).<p>This is not to say consumer apps are able to <i>ignore</i> performance concerns: you can still make garbage that way. But you&#x27;d be deep into the region of diminishing returns if you poured as many resources into performance for application-level code on something like Spotify as you did on e.g. codecs it uses or low-level rendering code it depends on.<p>And that&#x27;s the reason tech like Electron is so often selected by folks whose bottom line is massively affective by their ability to be objective about these issues.

But if the tradeoff means the app costs more, or has fewer accessibility or language features, or doesn&#x27;t run on the user&#x27;s chosen OS—which is more mean?<p>Second, this topic is contentious not because Spotify is slow but because many readers believe that building on Electron implies your app will be slow and is a basically negligent technology decision, a blight on the field of software engineering, and so on and so on... So, while I agree with your placement of Teams (though not Spotify incidentally), saying that because a couple Electron apps are not optimally snappy in this context reinforces the (imo) mistaken attribution of non-snappiness to Electron: afaict, of the major Electron apps out, there are at least as many that are snappy, and of the ones somewhat lacking in this department there are no native apps with feature parity to compare against (i.e. for Slack or Teams; Spotify otoh, maybe it is really bad for some people—not my experience, and the sample of 1 wouldn&#x27;t prove much).<p>In any case, I like the diagram and largely agree with its assertions in isolation.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d be happy to take a look at one of your longer rants if you want to point me to one. I am genuinely interested in better understanding the situation if I&#x27;ve missed something.

            There isn&#x27;t, as long as you&#x27;re willing to tolerate the risk of getting your account banned for blatant ToS violation.

            That&#x27;s pretty awesome, hadn&#x27;t heard of it before.<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s important to consider how much development time is spent on iterating as a new product&#x27;s design is figured out.

We know you can move fast with it (development speed), and that apps built with it can be fast (e.g. VSCode, Github desktop client, Discord)—but people can also build slow apps with it (no surprise), and there is a somewhat large constant factor for install size (~50mb base).<p>In my mind that does not stack up to merit the kind of complaints about Electron that can be found here every day.

            &gt; apps built with it can be fast (e.g. VSCode, Github desktop client, Discord)<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the other two, but there is no way I would describe Discord&#x27;s client as &quot;fast&quot;.  Starting the application takes 8-10 seconds during which it pops up several different windows on top.  Switching between channels has a delay of about 1 second or so.  If that channel isn&#x27;t in cache, then it adds another 3-6 seconds of delay.<p>Switching between views isn&#x27;t a new task, and isn&#x27;t an infrequent one.  If I think back to pidgin 20 years ago, the startup time was much faster, and switching between tabs had no perceptible delay.  Discord has the advantage of 6 years of Dennard scaling followed by another 14 years of Moore&#x27;s Law, so it has zero excuse for not being able to perform those same tasks to the same standard.

            You raise very good points, that together make the picture even more complex :).<p>&gt; <i>The company developing Slack has probably done the net work of building it 20 times over as its feature set developed and morphed over the years</i><p>That&#x27;s definitely true, especially in areas where they were innovating (or at least experimenting with features that were not <i>common</i> in the space). There&#x27;s a cost to R&amp;D, and I&#x27;ll agree that preferring velocity is important to minimize that cost, which justifies the use of &quot;nice for devs, bad for UX&quot; tools[0].<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;m sure Slack&#x27;s actual complete feature set eclipses Ripcords</i><p>That&#x27;s true. Ripcord doesn&#x27;t replicate Slack 1:1, there were few &quot;sparkly&quot; that were cut (at least when I used it ~2 years ago), and of course a lot of the chrome that got removed could be considered features by some. But at least by metric of productivity, Ripcord&#x27;s UX eclipses that of Slack.<p>&gt; <i>(most of the difference coming in via features not essential to most individual users, but key to the business)</i><p>In this particular case, I&#x27;d say it was 90% just removal of resource-intensive bloat. But that&#x27;s a good observation in general: one of the reasons some users are dissatisfied with official apps is because of what they[2] deem as user-hostile features, existing to exploit the user instead of aiding them. Obviously, they&#x27;re put there because they&#x27;re the key to the business. Plenty of obviously bad UX can be easily explained when one looks at how the vendor actually makes money.<p>&gt; <i>How many web page previews, videos, images, etc. are in those tabs?</i><p>Ripcord either doesn&#x27;t load those or is lazy about it. But when it does, you at least get the full picture, instead of having to click through some gallery-like popup interface :).<p>&gt; <i>apps built with [Electron] can be fast (e.g. VSCode, Github desktop client, Discord)</i><p>People will contest with you here because they&#x27;re using a different reference point for &quot;fast&quot;. VSCode is impressively fast... for an Electron app. Not so much in comparison to desktop-native apps implementing equivalent features. And that&#x27;s the one well-known exception, a typical Electron application is noticeably slower and more resource-intensive than an equivalent desktop app.<p>&gt; <i>large constant factor for install size (~50mb base)</i><p>This is not something that people care about unless you&#x27;re doing something silly, like an Electron TODO app that weighs 50MB and uses many times more of RAM, where the reference comparison is against a WinAPI app that would weigh 50 <i>kilobytes</i> and use not much more of memory.<p>This is also why people don&#x27;t generally complain about VS Code being Electron - it actually makes good use of all the features its platform offers. But most Electron apps? Picking Electron saves developers a little bit of time, at the cost of heavy resource tax for all users. That&#x27;s annoying. Especially if you have experience with native software that gives you reference points to compare.<p>--<p>[0] - I&#x27;m definitely guilty of this myself. At my previous job, I developed a prototype for 2.0 version of the company&#x27;s flagship product in two weeks, in... ObservableHQ[1]. The actual work to reimplement those features in our product took almost a year. I did joke we should probably ship the prototype in the meantime (especially given that our main competitor was an Excel plugin), but we never seriously considered that.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] - And when I say &quot;they&quot;, I also mean myself in most such discussions.

            &gt; <i>First is that this is fundamentally a question of tradeoffs, which means a single axis diagram like this is fundamentally misleading.</i><p>Agreed on the tradeoffs, and the diagram is a projection of complex parameter space onto a single axis.<p>&gt; <i>But if the tradeoff means the app costs more, or has fewer accessibility or language features, or doesn&#x27;t run on the user&#x27;s chosen OS—which is more mean?</i><p>That&#x27;s a very tricky question, because relationship between performance and those other factors is not straightforward. For example, the cost of making an app in a typical startup has zero relation to what the users pay - development is funded from investor money, and user-facing price is set by whatever shenanigans the business is doing at the moment - e.g. $0 to corner the market or maximize growth, or $10 as a calculated point that maximizes money extraction from a growing user base, etc.<p>(One would think there&#x27;s no free lunch, and eventually the price has to come close to costs - but that&#x27;s not how startups economy works. If you get to the point of having to turn actual profit, you&#x27;ve already missed your exit.)<p>Related to this is a second point: in a winner-takes-all market, the most successful app will suck the oxygen out of the room, preventing others from doing better work. Success typically isn&#x27;t determined by the app itself - the app is usually backed by a service, which makes it not commodizable. If you need Teams because of network effects, you won&#x27;t switch to Slack even though the app is better. You won&#x27;t dump Spotify for a competitor that doesn&#x27;t have an equivalent musical catalog. Etc.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is: the trade-offs are often arbitrary choices. Would it be possible for an app to successfully compete with Spotify while having fast, native clients for every platform and full accessibility? Definitely. But it&#x27;s not happening because it&#x27;s not possible for that app to break into that market in the first place. Our would-be app can&#x27;t compete on being a better music streaming player - it has to first reproduce the <i>entire</i> value-offering, including the streaming service, the library, and countless of deals negotiated with labels and musicians. This isn&#x27;t happening, and so Spotify isn&#x27;t getting any feedback from the market about their godawful garbage apps.<p>&gt; <i>because many readers believe that building on Electron implies your app will be slow and is a basically negligent technology decision, a blight on the field of software engineering, and so on and so on...</i><p>I&#x27;m partial to this view. The way I see it, picking Electron by default lands you smack in the middle of what I labeled as &quot;bad UX&quot; zone. It takes hard work - the kind of work you&#x27;ve described as trading against accessibility or existence - to move it into the &quot;good UX&quot; zone. That work isn&#x27;t usually done - you don&#x27;t pick Electron if you want to make a snappy app, you pick it because you care about <i>velocity</i>, cornering your little part of the market. So Electron apps tend to move towards the &quot;now you&#x27;re being mean&quot; zone - which is  where this common view of &quot;Electron = bloat&quot; comes from.

            &gt; ... the cost of making an app in a typical startup has zero relation to what the users pay ...<p>These aspects of where the money comes from are orthogonal to the tradeoffs problem though: at the end of the day you have some quantity of money and spending it on A means you don&#x27;t spend it on B. If performance was sacrificed, you can&#x27;t look at that in isolation: whether it was a good decision or not depends on what it was traded for.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s not happening because it&#x27;s not possible for that app to break into that market in the first place.<p>That whole situation is unfortunate, but tech like Electron that allows companies to take advantage of it also enables independent developers to build things they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have time for.

            Great thread and discussion. IMO, there&#x27;s some overhead to using a framework but it&#x27;s marginal compared to the data model&#x2F;flow&#x2F;architecture you&#x27;ve chosen to implement.

            &gt; you can create snappy experiences with vanilla JS and enough elbow grease ... But people naturally reach for modern frameworks - and that very decision is what usually kills snappiness at the spot<p>I think there is still a misconception here though: A) no elbow grease is required, and B) just using a popular framework (React, Vue) is not going to slow things down.<p>RE A, I would recommend just giving this a shot if you haven&#x27;t: try building a desktop application-like UI with html&#x2F;css&#x2F;js executed by Chromium. My expectation of what you would find: it is snappy by default, and it&#x27;s not even clear <i>how</i> you would write UI code bad enough to create a sluggish experience like e.g. Teams. IMO the explanation probably lies within some organizational structure at Microsoft, not the tech they&#x27;re building on. (One exception to the rule of things being fast by default: with animations it&#x27;s fairly easy to shoot yourself in the foot, but it doesn&#x27;t typically take more effort for performant animations, just basic knowledge of what is quick and what is resource intensive.)<p>RE B, similar situation here: I think if you try building something with React&#x2F;Vue you will see that they are also fast by default, and that no extra work is required to make them fast. That said, they (have the potential to) do a lot under the hood, so the potential for triggering something that would cause slowness is higher than without.<p>After writing this it seems like our disagreement may come down to this: my point is that the tech isn&#x27;t inherently slow and that a disciplined&#x2F;experienced programmer can use them to rapidly build high quality software; but maybe from your perspective the more significant thing is that in practice many developers using the technology <i>do</i> end up making sluggish&#x2F;bloated software, so: that the tech <i>allows</i> people to make slow things fairly easily is more important than its equal potential to make fast things. I.e. the problem is that there are no guardrails + it is the tech of choice of a huge community of developers, many of whom would benefit by the guardrails? (I don&#x27;t main to blame devs here so much, it&#x27;s probably more that fault of businesses&#x27; priorities than anything)

            None of the competitors care about making the ui 20ms faster. Apple music just flat out didn&#x27;t work for me, totally broken for the web version and not even an electron app.<p>Spotify is already better than the alternatives.

            The Spotify website and phone apps don&#x27;t just have performance issues, they have awful bugs that have been left unfixed for months&#x2F;years. When streaming to a Chromecast, the UI quickly gets out of sync, randomly disconnects, etc. I&#x27;m resorting to using a bluetooth receiver connected to my amplifier because that works better. The recommendations are also getting worse IMO, though that&#x27;s more subjective, hard to quantify, but the amount of time I spend using Spotify has gone down a lot, just because I&#x27;m not discovering enough interesting tracks anymore.<p>IMO, Spotify is neglecting its core features, and that will ultimately hurt the platform. However, there is such a thing as network effect, and they may have the broadest selection of music. That will keep the platform growing, up to a point. Eventually, the growth numbers may peak and slow down. It&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s a lot of inertia right now, and the growth is still going upwards, but eventually, gravity might catch up.

            &gt; The recommendations are also getting worse IMO<p>It seems to me that this happens on a per-user basis as recommendations are overfitted to the recommendations they&#x27;ve already listened to. They overfit so much that if you put a playlist of 1000 tracks you like on shuffle, it will only play the hundred or so tracks the algorithm has decided you &quot;really like&quot;, and it will play almost the same selection if you put it on shuffle the next day.<p>YouTube music (music on YouTube, not YouTube Music) works the same way but less subtly. I had a great few months discovering music through their recommendations, until literally every song I listened to would be followed on autoplay by &quot;Sergio Mendes feat. Black Eyed Peas - Mas Que Nada&quot; or &quot;Funky Destination - The Inside Man (Soopasoul remix)&quot;.

            &gt; Most people don&#x27;t care that it takes an extra 10-100 milliseconds<p>I probably wouldn&#x27;t care about it too much if they didn&#x27;t mess up the rest of their apps into the dogturd that they currently are. 
Doing bad UX is one thing, making UX consistently worse with pretty much every update another. And that&#x27;s what Spotify has been doing for years now - if I could go back to a client-version from a few years ago, I would, immediately, without thinking twice.<p>The fun part? My company jumped on the SAFe-train a while ago, and Spotify was heralded as the &quot;prime example&quot; of where agile and all that works out really well.<p>I have no idea what they are doing, but whatever it is - if they continue like this, I&#x27;ll go back to pirating music, because they&#x27;re getting really close to having just-as-bad of an experience as that. And I really don&#x27;t mind paying 20 bucks for my family account; experience is all I care about.

            Generic statements such as &quot;most people don&#x27;t care [...] extra 10-100ms for the UI&quot; need to be supported by evidence, especially since those 100ms are <i>added</i> to existing latency and 100ms is considered the threshold where operations feel instantaneous [1].<p>Still, for certain things 100ms is too much. Android famously had a round-trip audio latency of a bit above 100ms which made it a poor choice for music apps - in contrast to iOS. They now <i>require</i> 20ms in the Android Compatibility Definition Document and admit that musicians require 10ms [2].<p>In addition to that, hitting the 100ms threshold doesn&#x27;t mean that lag is not noticeable or not annoying.

            Yup. 100ms may be working as &quot;instantaneous&quot; in isolation. If you start chaining interactions, it absolutely isn&#x27;t.<p>Once per 100ms means 10 times per second. A game running at 10FPS would be considered unplayable, not just because of choppy rendering, but also because of input lag.

            Spotify&#x27;s Android app is of very poor quality.<p>Search is just so basic, you can not have any typos whatsoever.<p>There is no proper history function. Say you start a radio, it only remembers that you started a radio but if you come back to it you probably will not have the same songs.<p>Connectivity is piss poor. If you lost connection you will have to restart the app otherwise you won&#x27;t be able to use search.<p>While this is about the native desktop client, I assume it has similar problems so the argument that it is only a couple milliseconds of latency doesn&#x27;t hold up.

            You know what’s fascinating, I find these same things so annoying and also use it less because of that… but crucially I still pay for it. So in essence I’m their best customer. I pay and I don’t use it. All streaming platforms operate like gyms, they want the most paying customers who forget they even pay for the service and don’t really use it.<p>I’m guessing someone in Spotify’s marketing dept or user retention came up with an algo that determined the features&#x2F;bugs that would make the service just bad enough that it’s still usable (and thus worth paying for) but too annoying to use too often.

            If we followed similar arguments about hardware, we wouldn&#x27;t have Apple today. The entire premise of Apple&#x27;s hardware is that it is beautiful, well designed, with attention to details even in places where the user would never interact (motherboard layout and finish).<p>You might be guessing from intuition that 10-100ms latency doesn&#x27;t matter, but I suspect that it does. You can <i>feel</i> the philsophy of the company when you use their products and they feel wonderful. It&#x27;s a culmination of attention to detail in every aspect of development.

            The problem is that the people with decision power over software are usually not the ones who actually use it and latency issues are more of a subconscious thing.

            &gt; the only thing that matters is the end-user&#x27;s perceived value, and that&#x27;s almost always in the form of features and stability.<p>I think here it&#x27;s more accurate to say, &quot;the business&#x27; impression of the end-user&#x27;s perceived value&quot;.<p>Because a snappy user experience DOES have real value; in web we are very conscious that milliseconds cost viewers in load and response times. It&#x27;s well documented that brand positivity is connected to load and response times.<p>But users don&#x27;t know to tell you that until the performance gets REALLY bad.

            &gt; Most people don&#x27;t care that it takes an extra 10-100 milliseconds for the UI<p>TLDR: up to 100ms latency is fine, but alongside higher RAM usage, and when applied to all programs across your machine (not just a single app), hell breaks loose.<p>I entirely agree with this statement. However, most people don&#x27;t have a high-end machine like the developers test on, and actual difference in latency between an electron app and a web app may be over an order of magnitude larger.<p>The problem is in many parts of the world (including in poorer communities of the global north) people rely on second-hand hardware which even in 2021 typically has 1-4GB of RAM, so a single application taking hundreds of megabytes when not over a gigabyte of RAM will quickly lead to you swap hell and render your entire machine slower.<p>Despite being an ardent GNU&#x2F;Linux user, I believe the linux kernel OOM is close to the worst that can be done in this matter (although there are certain progresses with eg. earlyoom), but MacOS and Windows are certainly not immune from it. You&#x27;d be surprised just how much people avoid using their computer altogether when they don&#x27;t absolutely need it, just because it&#x27;s slow as hell, just because developers in their ~ivory towers~ offices didn&#x27;t do testing on reasonable second-hand hardware.

Hell, when you&#x27;re used to 140+hz refresh rate, apps that have hardcoded a 60fps GUI refresh loop, so 16ms between two frames, are terribly obvious (and really feel like a pain to use)

            It&#x27;s not good, but it&#x27;s not the worst. Of course i prefer applications which feel instantaneous, but these are hard to come by nowadays. I don&#x27;t have strong opinions for 140Hz refresh rate, because i don&#x27;t think i ever had monitors with more than 60Hz.<p>Many modern JS&#x2F;Electron apps are in fact network bound for UI updates which is the worst possible thing you can do... just try to use element.io in a Tor Browser on a normal xDSL connection and you&#x27;ll see what i mean (unless it&#x27;s improved recently). So on this scale of the absurdity of modern software engineering, 100ms latency for user interaction is not all that bad... although my GUI&#x2F;CLI tools in the 90s were much snappier than that and we have in fact greatly regressed as a field.

            Spotify has certainly degraded over time.
My latest frustration: Controlling external devices via my computer or phone.<p>I&#x27;ll often play from my phone and connect it to my Echo speaker group. This used to work so seamlessly - it was beautiful.<p>But now - it takes 10 seconds for the initial connect. If I hit play&#x2F;pause there&#x27;s a 5-second delay to the point where I&#x27;ll tap it twice, which is also delayed, and then it&#x27;ll stutter and jump around. And worst of all: I&#x27;ll hit pause, come back to it in a few minutes, and it&#x27;s completely disconnected.

            One of the big (for me) issues with the old, native client was accessibility, or the complete lack of it.<p>As a screen reader user, I couldn&#x27;t use Spotify at all before the Chromium client was released, first in beta and then in stable.<p>Spotify&#x27;s desktop accessibility was... passable, but far from great. It improved massively with the most recent UI redesign, which is almost universally hated by sighted folks.<p>This is a pattern I see pretty often, Reddit is another great example. Old Reddit is almost unusable to me, the new one is a massive improvement.

            Rdio was great, but it could not compete with Spotify’s performance. The funny thing is, those performance advantages (p2p streaming and a native C++ desktop client) are now ancient history. Rdio was ahead of its time.

            Additionally Spotify&#x27;s original app came out at the time iTunes was (is?) a big bloated mess, especially on Windows.<p>When Spotify came along it felt like a breath of fresh air, light, nimble, instant playback. Obviously the streaming approach was a departure from the older way, but it just felt so much better to use.<p>Such a shame they seem to have lost their way with the browser based thing.

            &gt; Spotify&#x27;s original client back in 2008 started out as beautifully light, custom rendered native client.<p>I think <i>time</i> is a large contributing factor. A lot of things start off simple and elegant.

            I love Insomnia and usually recommend it to others.<p>But I remember a few months ago I was developing a basic API and testing it through Insomnia. At first, I almost had a heart attack seeing the time it took to answer, between clicking &quot;send&quot; and getting a response back. All this running on localhost, on an old but fairly powerful box (i7-3930k, 64 GB ram). My first reaction was I must have had some sleep() lying around.<p>Then I looked at the details, and the actual time taken handling the call, etc, as reported by Insomnia was a few ms, all the rest was... I don&#x27;t know what.<p>But I do agree than other than that, when interacting with the app itself (switch requests, type, etc) it feels snappy enough. I usually use it alongside IntelliJ, which while fairly fast, isn&#x27;t terminal-level instantaneous.

            Maybe try elaborating yourself? The constant criticism of Electron Apps is that they&#x27;re bloated and slow, you&#x27;re claiming otherwise but missed the part providing any presumption of evidence to the contrary.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to experience any Electron App that&#x27;s close to the snappiness and UX of the original native Spotify client, I&#x27;d like to hear about good examples of Electron Apps comparable to it.

            Electron adds no more overhead than Chrome does. Any snappy web app can be packaged as an Electron app and be equally snappy. So if there are no snappy Electron apps it&#x27;s because of the web, not Electron.

            The web is filled with bloated and slow web applications. This is nothing new. Electron is taking the fall for existing on a popular platform that lots of fast moving companies are using and unfortunately gumming up with feature creep and poor architectural design.<p>I don’t care to share details of my past employers but I have absolutely worked on web apps that ran 60 Hz on mobile and looked beautiful to boot.<p>It was a team of senior devs though, and it was a small shop. We didn’t suffer from the same organizational issues at the time but as we grew, sure enough - the web application slowed as the need  to move quickly and cut corners arose.<p>The point is that the web offers you a vast array of performance footguns that anyone on a tight schedule is going to wind up firing off at one time or another. Electron isn’t to blame. It’s architecture and code practices.<p>But the web is easy to hate, and by association Electron is going to take a ton of flack.

            Right, so still no evidence despite continuing to claim otherwise. Lets start off easy, what&#x27;s the best example of a publicly downloadable Electron App that has the snappiest UX?<p>Having experienced the original Spotify App myself and having used many Electron Apps daily for years I&#x27;d posit that it&#x27;s naive to claim the responsiveness and snappiness of the original Spotify App could ever be reimplemented in Electron. You&#x27;re claiming it is, so lets hear about some examples we can actually use?

            No evidence?

I actually find VSCode to be an impressive achievement with Electron, though, fwiw - which is probably not much given your obvious predisposition.

            If you make a ludicrous claim the onus is on you to provide some resemblance of evidence to back it up, the extent and reasons you go into avoid doing so is obvious and transparent.<p>VS Code is a good general multi-purpose text editor that I use daily, but it&#x27;s nowhere near the responsiveness and performance of a native editors like Sublime Text.<p>Opening a 1MB text file with no other VS Code windows open takes up 350MB, Sublime is 48MB. If I want to view a file quickly I&#x27;ll use a native text editor. But please keep baselessly spouting how Electron produces the snappiest apps and how it&#x27;s everyone elses fault for assuming just because every Electron App they&#x27;ve ever used is slow, it&#x27;s not Electron&#x27;s fault - which apparently when used in stealth internally produces just as fast and snappy UX&#x27;s as native Apps.

            You’re misrepresenting my argument.<p>I did not say Electron intrinsically produces snappy apps. I said that one CAN produce snappy Electron apps.<p>Which is indeed true, but as highlighted elsewhere by more reasonable individuals - the baseline for the web is slow. It requires expertise to do right, and in ways other platforms might not demand.<p>The benefit? Run it everywhere. The downside? $$$ and time. That’s why most just take their “run everywhere” benefit and accept the fact their app is going to be slow and&#x2F;or a hog.<p>We’re discussing the platform’s potential, not the common case result of the platform’s broad userbase.

            One needn’t exist for my claim to be true. It’s based on how the actual platform works and having built performant web sites. I would agree nearly every mainstream Electron implementation is a mess, but so is nearly every mainstream website. It’s rare companies deem it important to build that level of performance because by and large customers don’t give enough of a shit. Except Hackernews posters, that is.

            That’s not what I mean when I say 60 Hz. I’m referring to performance navigating about the app. There was a small startup latency to populate the store but it was smooth sailing after that. Even that you could probably optimize out today with a talented team given all the new PWA tech.<p>I will say though that I’ve yet to work anywhere else that held themselves to a comparable performance standard.

            Anything is possible. No one here is arguing it’s absolutely impossible for an electron app to be fast. But as you said the amount of work it would take is simply not worth it… with a lot less effort you could make a much more performant native app, so it’s never gonna happen.<p>You’re being pedantic and are upset that you’re being called out.

            Hardly. I think it’s extremely worth the investment to make performant web applications. It’s the true vision of write once run everywhere. That a lot of naive leadership teams don’t understand or care to invest in that is a mistake - or perhaps a forced hand due to the lockout of web apps from the phone app ecosystem - not a demonstration of infallible analysis on the utility of the web platform.<p>The problem is not Electron. It’s far bigger than Electron. I realize this is a take that requires knowledge of the web platform and industry, however, and as such may simply be lost on folks without that context.<p>You’re being hard headed and am upset I don’t agree with you.

            Web technologies are default-slow while native (except Java on Android) is typically default-fast. One needs to go out of their way to create a slow native app, even if it&#x27;s of course possible.<p>Slowness is the natural state of web applications and creating a fast web application is much more difficult and requires a senior team with knowledge about browser implementation in order to avoid or work around the performance pitfalls.<p>I also have the feeling that such performance comparisons are done with the assumption that the apps under test are almost the only thing running on the machine.

            It’s certainly an easy fall-person for their performance issues, but it seems just as reasonable to blame an ever-expanding feature set, including advertisements and all of the analytics to go with, along with a great deal of just… age? Spotify isn’t a young company anymore, and they’ve been maintaining their shop for long enough that the kitchen sink is undoubtedly strapped to their app by now.

            One thing that has devastated me about recent Spotify updates is that now, when viewing an Artist, you do not get to see all of the albums (or at least the first 10 newest albums) for that artist straight away with all of the tracks listed. It&#x27;s now much harder to find a song that you don&#x27;t know the title of, but you know an artist has sung.<p>It&#x27;s also small changes that are extremely annoying. Pressing &quot;New Playlist&quot; used to come up with a dialog box asking what the playlist should be named. Now it just gets called &quot;New Playlist&quot;. Clicking the playlist name to rename it does not automatically select the textbox to give it a name, meaning that to create a new named playlist - an action that used to take one click, is at least three clicks and two keyboard presses... I mean, come on Spotify!<p>The search bar used to always be visible. Now I need to click search first, then click the search bar.<p>To me, Spotify was the epitome of software completion five years ago. The client worked. It was perfect. It seems like every single update since they released the &quot;Daily Mixes&quot;  has both downgraded the performance of the app, and made discoverability harder. I want Spotify how it was 18 months ago.<p>Spotify on my machine sometimes chews up 2GB of RAM. Reached out to support, and the best that they can give is &quot;try restarting the app&quot;. That helps, until 12 hours later you need to do it again. A music player should not have 10% CPU usage on a modern MacBook.<p>Finding Psst has been a life changer.

            Discoverability...<p>I&#x27;d pay handsomely for an app that did discovery on tracks and not artists. Last.fm kind of but not really does it. It took me many years to get from Sirenia: Seven Sirens And A Silver Tear to the Midnight Sonata (I can&#x27;t remember alas who did it -- was it reddit or a forum on a now defunct tracker? all the great trackers are dead) and from there I was able to branch out. But this shouldn&#x27;t be so hard..? We already have several music matching apps, surely closeness is a solvable problem.

            They really do make things worse and worse and worse. Related to your playlist example - saving an actual album I liked as a new playlist would give it a default title, &quot;artist - album title&quot; or something like that. Fine, 2 clicks: create the playlist, and accept the title.<p>Now? A blank text box. &quot;Let&#x27;s ignore the artist and album this user&#x27;s basing a playlist on and make them type the whole thing from memory&quot;. I just don&#x27;t bother any more, which seems petty but it&#x27;s just so cumbersome, from mobile especially.

            I wonder if some of these decisions are driven by their business model. My understanding is Spotify&#x27;s agreement with record labels means they have very low margin on a typical song stream. I&#x27;ve heard that some of their playlists are very valuable for artists and that there&#x27;s some payola going on there. It could make sense that they&#x27;re nudging people in those directions.<p>They also see much more upside in podcasts and thus are pushing people there.

            An album is (ideally) carefully crafted to work as a coherent musical statement.  Tracks in isolation don&#x27;t have the same effect.  It&#x27;s even more so in classical music, where a work usually encompasses multiple tracks.  One of my frustrations with Spotify is that it doesn&#x27;t understand multi-movement works, so you get an single movement — sometimes even one that is connected to the preceding or following one — in isolation, and it&#x27;s often really unsatisfying.<p>tl;dr I think albums have more significance than you do.

            Let the user be the one choosing how to use the music.<p>I think Spotify (at least for me and I think for many others) is great because of lists: I&#x27;m the one choosing what and when to listen the songs, and I&#x27;m able to group them. I have lists made out of albums where I respect the order that you mention, with the same implications. But some other lists I have hours of songs that don&#x27;t fit under the concept of album.<p>I agree and understand your point, but I think in the past Spotify&#x27;s UI had both options: the songs were sorted by album, but also allowed me to access all of them and cherry-pick the ones I wanted easily from that same view.

            Not sure how it works now, but back with GPM, you could get access to all the songs by purchasing the album on Google play. Some tracks just can&#x27;t be played unless you pay for them.

            I just checked Spotify, and it seems like yes, it does now get focused automatically, not sure if it was always that way, or I just feel that I need to click the textbox after choosing the menu item on the left hand side.<p>That being said, it was still much friendlier to have a search box that you could click on straight away. From a UX perspective, you need to move your focus away from where you have clicked, because the textbox is in a different area of view.<p>Clicking back on the search menu clears the search that you were doing. It&#x27;s fine, you can click the back button, but the old Spotify client (iirc!) would keep your previous search in the search box.

            At this point, I&#x27;d be willing to pay for a Spotify client that works exactly the same, but just ignores the existence of podcasts entirely. I use a dedicated podcast client when I want to listen to podcasts, and they keep shoving them in my face and taking up precious UI real estate everywhere.<p>But any client without support for Spotify Connect might as well be dead to me. Controlling my wifi speakers from my phone, or playing music on my desktop Mac from my laptop or gaming PC is critical functionality at this point.

            Check out spicetify cli[0]! It patches the Spotify (desktop) client and makes it better. It also adds support for extensions, one of which[1] disables the podcast features. I haven&#x27;t used the extension so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works.<p>Heads up though, the original developer is MIA at the moment and the latest few versions of the client are incompatible. There&#x27;s an effort by someone to fix the issues and there are other maintainers who mostly just seem to address PRs. Personally I just downgraded the client and it works perfectly.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;khanhas&#x2F;spicetify-cli" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;khanhas&#x2F;spicetify-cli</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;3raxton&#x2F;spicetify-custom-apps-and-extensions&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;spicetify-hide-podcasts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;3raxton&#x2F;spicetify-custom-apps-and-extensi...</a>

            This. I absolutely hate it when apps try to be smart and use their own audio routing.<p>I&#x27;m a Linux user and have multiple audio outputs.

It always says &quot;custom configuration&quot; but you never know where it goes, and partially ignores the configuration in PulseAudio &#x2F; PipeWire.<p>I understand why they do this, random users may find it more useful to have this choice directly in front of them, and I would agree... if it worked well! Zoom at least has the good taste to have an entry for &quot;use system settings&quot;, which seems to mostly work.<p>I think that aside from &quot;specialty&quot; applications (like DAWs, etc) regular apps have no business messing around with the system audio settings.

            Came here to say this. It was hard enough losing Rdio and now Spotify has been on a rapid decline for the last 1-2 years. It used to be a place to listen to music you already knew and maybe find something new and now they do nothing but shove podcasts down your throat. Who that works there is looking at the current UI as an improvement?

            I loved Rdio for the Ui. I subscribed for years. That said Spotify has introduced me to so much music that I missed growing up.<p>The Spotify UI has been pretty painful lately but I have a hard time living because the suggested music selection has been so good.

            They would probably see it like we computers that had memory which did not wipe when powered down. The inconvenience is minor and the benefits large. They will never deal with huge hell balls of cables&#x2F;headphones.

            AirPods do not STT announce a low battery unless that&#x27;s an accessibility setting. By default they just play a little tone to alert you that your battery is low. An argument can be made around the expensive of AirPods but not when it comes to usability, they are bar none. Watching my Android friends cycle though bluetooth headphones like changing outfits is always interesting to me. Every few months I hear about &quot;check out these awesome headphones, they are so small and they have noise cancelling&quot;, <i>yawn</i>, I&#x27;ve been using the same AirPods Pro since they released and they&#x27;ve tried 3+ and still aren&#x27;t happy. I didn&#x27;t want to believe it and refused to buy AirPods when they first came out until I got them as a gift and reluctantly used them but after I lost them (or they were stolen, still not sure) it took less than 3 days before I had ordered more. They really are magic.

            How is the battery holding up on the Pros? My 1st gen AirPods were dead (each bud only holds about 20 mins of charge) after a year. I then tried a pair of the SoundCore Air Liberty 2 (what a name...) with the same result after a year or so. I can&#x27;t justify paying $200 every year, so I&#x27;m sticking with wired for now.

            I mean, I&#x27;ve had the same Pros since launch and I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in the battery. I mean, I&#x27;m sure there is a decrease but I listen for hours and hours at a time without issue. If I go longer than 4 hours I might get the low battery notification but they charge so fast that I can either take a break or do the &quot;charge 1 at a time&quot; trick so keep listening.

            It&#x27;s not just charging. You can pretty much connect it to any device in a second without waiting for a minute for bluetooth connection. Maybe airpod is good for single person use who has very limited devices which are all Apple, but I own multiple non Apple devices. Even though all have bluetooth, bluetooth is much more error prone than 3.5mm jack.

            This is completely true but I also just don&#x27;t really care. The airpods are quite small and use minimal resources so the environmental impact of buying airpods every 5 years is minimal compared to other things. I already do not use a car or public transport so I am well below the average persons resource usage.<p>And for price, $250AUD every 5 years is well within what I am willing to pay for the convenience of the airpods. I use them daily, I have them in my pocket always. Being able to quickly put them on and take a call and it all just works instantly is worth it to me.<p>I also have just not ever had in ear headphones ever last that long either. The cable always breaks within a few years max of usage.

            Absolutely, but the thought that a 3,5mm jack makes everything always compatible is nonsense. Sure, it will work with most consumer products in some way, but it is not a given that it is working as intended.

            I&#x27;m with you 100%. If they had a decent podcast experience, I&#x27;d be happy to switch but it&#x27;s terrible. Why can&#x27;t I mark something as already played?

            Yep; I&#x27;m a paying customer of spotify and I like some of the podcasts they have. But they don&#x27;t have the gap removal + speed controls of Overcast (my fav podcast program on my phone). So I&#x27;m in this weird situation of never wanting to listen to any podcasts through the spotify app, which I&#x27;m paying for. And then when I want to listen to music (eg while coding) I have to wade through podcasts which are intentionally designed to blend in with music recommendations in spotify&#x27;s apps.<p>I hate it. If any spotify PMs are listening:<p>- If spotify wants me to listen to podcasts, let me do it from my existing podcast app. I&#x27;m sure the developer of Overcast (and other apps) would happily add a spotify login button for a song if you ask nicely and offered to pay.<p>- Let users disable podcasts entirely in the spotify app.<p>- In the spotify app, give podcasts a consistent visual differentiator so I can easily visually separate them from music. Nobody wants to be tricked into listening to a podcast instead of music. Maybe make the &quot;album cover&quot; for podcasts a rectangle instead of a square. Or change the background color for all podcast related content to blue so I can find podcasts visually (or filter them out visually) while scrolling.

            I don’t think Spotify wants you to be able to use your favorite app.<p>Their strategy is to take the open protocol of podcasts and pay the hosts to turn that into centralized tracks on Spotify to force you as the user to use Spotify to listen to it.<p>It’s about control intentionally - that’s the strategy.

            When I used Spotify I had wished my podcasts were able to be there since it would be convenient to just have the tracks in the same UI.<p>What I wanted though was just the ability to add podcasts via the open protocol url for them (how every other podcast app works) or for them to allow hosts to upload tracks.<p>Spotify instead saw an aggregation play - they could pay hosts for exclusivity and take those podcasts away from their open distribution into a distribution entirely controlled by Spotify. This is a hostile move to end users (and ultimately most content creators too in the end).

            They get ROI if people subscribe to spotify. Why would they care whether I listen to podcasts through their official app or through a 3rd party&#x27;s app?<p>If spotify&#x27;s podcasts are available in my preferred podcast app after I&#x27;ve logged in to my spotify account, they still get paid.

            If you care about Podcasts, don&#x27;t listen to them on Spotify, ever. Spotify&#x27;s plan is to build a walled garden around them.<p>Spotify promotes podcasts and buys exclusives so desperately, because their plan is to grow their audience to a too-big-to-fail size, so they start dictating their own terms. Every remaining use of RSS is a business opportunity.

            It’s insane that Spotify on Mac doesn’t support airplay.<p>When my girlfriend and I moved in together, we got rid of her Alexa devices because privacy and use HomePods. But Spotify doesn’t work with AirPlay for reasons I cannot fathom, so I set her up with a program that will AirPlay specific applications on her Mac.<p>That said, there are open source libraries and clients for AirPlay so it shouldn’t be too difficult to get them supported. I have a Raspberry Pi for streaming to “dumb” speakers.

            Airfoil [1] is worth every penny. The same could be said for pretty much everything Rogue Amoeba makes.<p>It’s also worth noting that Spotify can act as a remote for its own service across devices. So you can start a song playing on your phone and direct the output over AirPlay and then just interface with that session using the desktop client.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rogueamoeba.com&#x2F;airfoil&#x2F;mac&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rogueamoeba.com&#x2F;airfoil&#x2F;mac&#x2F;</a>

            If I understood your problem correctly, you need to listen to Spotify through your HomePod which is on the same local network as your Mac.<p>This is what I do on macOS. I press on the little megaphone icon (enable it in OS sound preferences) in menu bar and then I can choose my HomePod from the list, without any third party software. I am running Big Sur but in two previous versions I also did the same. Maybe I’m missing something here but I think it should work seamlessly.

            That routes <i>all</i> the audio from the mac though, not only Spotify. And with a noticeable delay.<p>This makes watching a &quot;GIF&quot; with audio (say browsing Reddit), opening a video, answering a slack call, etc. a very bad experience.<p>Spotify by itself supports its own protocol, whatever that may be, and chromecast. The iOS app should also support Airplay through the OS.<p>Personally I have a Spotify enabled receiver plugged to my audio system, it works really well.

            The Mac can use the Airplay device as an output device, but it&#x27;s not ideal, because that will send ALL sound to the Airplay device.<p>The correct solution is for the application to support Airplay, so that for instance Spotify can stream music to your Airplay device, while the Mac sounds still goes to the speakers of the laptop&#x2F;iMac.

            Got me thinking. I wonder how much scope there is to build apps for platforms like Spotify which are built around a given use case.<p>For example - for people that prefer listening to albums. Or people that only care about political podcasts. Or something. I wonder if the global audience is enough to support indie products like this.<p>Significant platform risk though.

            Eh. Ish. They only support playback within a browser and have deprecated native playback support years ago. Also their ToS technically doesn&#x27;t let you do a looot of things you may want. Like caching. Srsly, you&#x27;re not allowed to cache things. Many 3rd parties stopped supporting spotify because the dev ToS kept getting worse.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;m excited about this little project even if it goes against the ToS.

            Things like Napster have a long tradition dating back to the 1960s, in the UK the response to the paternalistic and stuffy state monopoly on music broadcasting was for people to put studios and transmitters on ships parked just outside of British territorial waters. That’s really what fuelled the explosion in British music!

            Running the risk of being a dirty reposter and.. reposting.  My little Spotify client is for macOS only, mostly only built for my own use, and a lot more minimal, visually.  It&#x27;s also native Swift though, so it&#x27;s got that nice macOS feel.  It&#x27;s also pretty much 100% keyboard-driven (Vim keys, if that&#x27;s something you like) and supports regex filters.  It&#x27;s just an open-source thing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;toothbrush&#x2F;Spotiqueue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;toothbrush&#x2F;Spotiqueue</a>

            This is good to see.<p>It shows you can write native cross-platform apps that are fast and have low system resource usage instead of the now default, packaging your app in a standalone resource-intensive web browser, aka Electron.<p>It&#x27;s a shame we have a handful of people who can do this as a hobby project yet multi billion dollar companies with the money and manpower to do this don&#x27;t, they chose Electron.

            Hi, the author here. Keyboard navigation is definitely something I&#x27;d like to focus on soon, the app should be 100% usable without a mouse. And accessibility is definitely on the Druid roadmap! &lt;3

            Keyboard shortcuts should be doable, I don&#x27;t think this is a limitation of the toolkit.<p>Obviously screen readers are an important step, but we hope to be working with AccessKit.<p>In any case, though I&#x27;m not trying to represent Druid as ready for production use, I love seeing stuff like this. I think it&#x27;s a good sign of what&#x27;s possible and where things are headed.

            Trying psst here on Linux I came away with the opposite impression - Druid&#x27;s further along than I expected, it Just Worked at high DPI on Wayland better than most electron apps. I guess it&#x27;d feel worse on MacOS which already has a more consistent system UI.

            Why do people keep forgetting this? You can use Qt to easily build a &quot;fast&quot; GUI that works on all platforms. And you can do it with Python via PyQt. No complicated C++ or Rust, unless you actually need it (which this almost certainly does not).<p>Picard is a good example of a PyQt app: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picard.musicbrainz.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picard.musicbrainz.org&#x2F;</a><p>I suspect the real reason is that web developers are seen as a dime a dozen and GUI programmers more specialist and hard to find. This was the main reason my team chose to do an Electron app. We were already doing React on the website and nobody had any experience with Qt.

            Not your parent. Just clarifying.<p>1. Electron apps also have access to &quot;your whole (userspace) system&quot;.<p>2.

            Too much work. With Electron, one can just `npm i electron-analytics` and done. Without Electron, libraries like that will have to be patched (at least) to be usable with the custom runtime.

            &gt; Psst: Fast Spotify client with native GUI, without Electron, built in Rust<p>I wonder what&#x27;s faster: The new GUI, linked user accounts getting suspended or the project getting legal issues with the result of being taken down.<p>¯\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>No, seriously.

            This uses the same API as libspotify, a library for accessing Spotify for playback that Spotify released themselves. It’s not been supported for a while so future support for this API is unclear, but it’s not clearly going to be shut down like you suggest.<p>Apple Music also has an official and maintained API for building third party clients.

            But you are not decrypting the DRM. The software you are using is decrypting the audio stream in real time in a way that works similar to the official client. The logged in user is not breaking the TOS.

            &gt; harder DRM measures<p>Is that even possible for Spotify at this point?<p>The OP project is speaking to Spotify servers through the same means that official clients are, but the official clients are not just on iOS, Android, macOS and Windows.<p>There’s official Spotify clients on almost every platform imaginable. Everything from PS4 to built into TVs. And even a lot of stereo systems have Spotify Connect built into them.<p>Spotify Connect works by having these other devices streaming and playing the media, and your computer or phone acting as a “remote” for choosing the songs to be played. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spotify.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;connect&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spotify.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;connect&#x2F;</a><p>Basically they’d have to break a lot of official clients, many of which probably cannot be updated, if they were to change their DRM scheme. How do you update a receiver for example? Well, you might be able to flash a new firmware with a USB stick. But for regular people, they are not going to do that. And the DRM scheme, at least as of yet, would be defeated by the reverse engineers as DRM always is. And hopefully continues to be.<p>So at least as of yet I think they would hurt people with official clients more than they would hurt anyone using an unofficial client.<p>And even people using unofficial clients are probably paying customers.<p>Besides what’s the point anyways, everyone knows that if you really really want to rip audio you don’t need to circumvent any DRM at all. You can play the song on your computer or your phone and take the analog signal that is going to the speakers and digitize it again and make an imperfect but still good copy of any audio. Admittedly it doesn’t scale anywhere near as good as automatically stripping DRM though.

            Music publishers could demand better DRM in their contracts, though. That would lock out any devices incapable of receiving DRM updates, but it&#x27;s certainly a possibility. If Spotify would refuse to budge, their platform would lose access to a lot of songs. If they agree, their users would have a terrible experience, only being able to play some songs on some devices.<p>In order for Spotify to have any decent user experience, they need to nip any DRM bypass as scale in the bud before the publishers find out, through cease and desist or worse. If better DRM becomes the only solution, everyone loses.<p>The difference between official and unofficial clients is that Spotify can have some (contractual) power over the official clients, like demand that music is cached encrypted, demand a certain limit for cached music, etc. Unofficial clients aren&#x27;t bound by any contract, so the developers could easily do something they shouldn&#x27;t be doing according to the terms and conditions Spotify lays out (or the terms and conditions of the copyright holders that Spotify must uphold).

            Something is stopping them: all the old devices that already know how to speak Spotify.<p>Spotify is built on bringing your music library with you everywhere. If your car or five year old stereo stops being able to play spotify songs, why would you still pay for a Premium account? 2% loss doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but at Spotify&#x27;s scale, that would mean loosing 2 million paying customers. If they pay $5 &#x2F;month, that&#x27;s not pocket change.

            One thing that could be done - and which is already what&#x27;s being done by most video streaming companies - is to just propose really poor audio qualities to devices&#x2F;softwares with less DRM capabilities and only unlock the better qualities when e.g. Widevine L1 or PlayReady SL3000 is available.<p>What&#x27;s more, media-oriented devices like smart tvs or game consoles usually have those requirements.

            But as a sibling has posted, this is a posture &#x2F; plausible deniability thing.<p>I&#x27;ve looked it up a few years ago, so this may have changed, but at the time you couldn&#x27;t just ask Spotify for the SDK &#x2F; docs to build your own Connect client. I don&#x27;t remember the details, but you&#x27;d have to jump through some hoops, at which point I stopped looking since I wasn&#x27;t about to build anything industrial. I expect some terms would be that you&#x27;d at least try to protect the keys.

            The name of the game is risk mitigation. In this case, there are lots of ways to rip a singular track. They are usually slow because you record the audio stream from Spotify.<p>But if you could get the original file from Spotify&#x27;s servers and decrypt it yourself, you could automate downloading your entire library, offline forever at source quality DRM free. Unfortunately, that is illegal and Spotify is going to dick them with lawyers. Pretty sure that&#x27;s what happened to this project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25017167" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25017167</a><p>History: after the developer decided to pivot from only being a tool to scrape the encryption keys needed to decrypt an individual song, the developer decided it would be a good idea to build in automating the downloading and also decryption of those files, instead of letting people develop that as a separate tool.<p>Developer and project has disappeared shortly after that decision.

            librespot is a reverse-engineered thin client (using the same api that e.g. your &quot;smart speakers&quot; would). It doesn&#x27;t use official APIs, arguably violates DMCA, and you pretty much have to use it if you don&#x27;t want to simultaneously run the full thick official client on the same device at the same time.

            I think the idea of desktop apps being web apps repackaged is now so ingrained that some people have never experienced true desktop app performance.<p>As in, zero latency, or no observable latency. Instant performance. Honestly, it sickens me how spectacular advances in hardware translate into performance being worse than before.<p>Even the Office client apps are now web (React). And you can tell. Sluggish and glitchy.<p>As for the Spotify app, I have little love for it. Overengineered garbage where the simplest actions leave you searching. Internally, they have created this massively complex structure of squads and tribes each taking care of just one tiny part of the experience. This may explain why Spotify is so disconnected and makes no sense.<p>All of this engineering effort, I imagine there to be at least a few hundred working on it, ultimately add up to an experience less usable than bloody Windows Media Player from the 90s.

            You&#x27;re right that the main source is a 2018 original tweet, and then some articles building on that tweet, and then news dries up.<p>This is the best I can find, with the Microsoft MVP clarifying the situation:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mspoweruser.com&#x2F;no-microsoft-is-not-rewriting-office-in-javascript&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mspoweruser.com&#x2F;no-microsoft-is-not-rewriting-office...</a><p>Specific point of interest:<p>&quot;Office 365’s UI, a lot of it, but definitely not all of it, are pieces that are built using React Native (Windows). API’s and Services are still going to be powered by C++, C#, or whatever is the most appropriate for that team. Nothing is converting to “all&#x2F;completely” JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript.&quot;<p>To me, this confirms that at least the UI is React. Anecdotally, it feels very &quot;web&quot; as I use it daily. Sluggish, missing paint cycles when switching between apps, and the typical main thread freezes.<p>I&#x27;ll let you decide if this is convincing enough evidence :)

            So Electron is the problem. It gets worse if you have lots of tabs open in Chrome + running other electron apps as well. A visible and obvious improvement when compared with a native app.<p>Also, Electron apps do not scale and it wastes CPU time, eats RAM up and fills up HDD space. On laptops, it drains the battery faster.<p>A quadruple negative to the user.

It&#x27;s literally every single thing I dislike about Spotify fixed. There are no podcasts, I can search, there&#x27;s no social senselessness anymore.. I&#x27;m thrilled.<p>The only problem I have is that eventually it just gobbles CPU. Having it open and doing nothing seems to take ~4% of my CPU, and while playing a constant 7.2%. Frankly, I assume this is decoding, but I haven&#x27;t traced yet. Eventually it spun out of control and pegged one CPU at ~90%, which a quick restart fixed.  All of this is to say it&#x27;s an incredible project - I&#x27;m not going back to the old client.

            I&#x27;ve never given Spotify a try because of the crummy web&#x2F;Electron player I saw everyone using. Wanted to try this out, but it only works with a premium account. That could&#x27;ve been mentioned more clearly, would&#x27;ve saved me the effort of compiling this thing.<p>I can&#x27;t judge the main application but just the settings screen makes me feel like the UI library powering this isn&#x27;t quite ready for prime time yet. I consider shortcuts and basic text handling like ctrl+a to select all text in a textbox to be basic features for any UI toolkit; the lack of such ease of use features really makes the GUI toolkit feel less native than the Electron cruft that&#x27;s overtaking our desktops.<p>As for the legality, the DMCA sucks but this client is definitely in violation of it. Breaking the TOS isn&#x27;t necessarily illegal so the tool is fine to use (at the risk of getting your account banned) but development can be quite risky. Hopefully, Spotify takes an interest and uses (a fork of) this project to write a faster player for their desktop clients instead of cease-and-desisting it to hell.

            Any circumvention of DRM, even simple DRM as long as it&#x27;s not too trivial, is considered illegal under the DMCA. The decryption routines Spotify uses should definitely be considered non-trivial DRM.

            No, not at all. There are ways to implement this without making it a requirement to use the app. For example, you implement a counter for each user of the app, so they can only use a subset of the API requests allowed for your application.<p>Then if they go over their allocated amount of calls, or they have been a user for X days&#x2F;weeks&#x2F;months, you give them a guided walkthrough on how to register their own API key.

            this, I wanted to make a little utility for getting lyrics for whatever song is currently playing on spotify[1] and ran into the issue for getting the song name without using the API since that&#x27;s just inconvenient for the end user. The most popular such project does go that way though.[2]<p>I ended up writing a small library that does that locally cross-platform by using the metadata from the app.[3] The approach is probably not as robust as the API, but much faster and works well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SwagLyrics&#x2F;SwagLyrics-For-Spotify" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SwagLyrics&#x2F;SwagLyrics-For-Spotify</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;johnwmillr&#x2F;LyricsGenius" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;johnwmillr&#x2F;LyricsGenius</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SwagLyrics&#x2F;SwSpotify" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SwagLyrics&#x2F;SwSpotify</a>

            Spotify regularly upsets me with change. Don&#x27;t change a UI that looks good and works well just to hide something I need. It feels like it&#x27;s just justification to have an entire team of client designers employed.<p>I remember when Spotify had Lyrics, which is an obvious choice of feature for a music service. It was off my a line or two, but it worked pretty well and I used it all the time. It was the best way to hear the music and see the lyrics that I knew of. Then, one day, I open the client and see that clicking the lyrics button showed a message that the lyrics feature was being enhanced and it&#x27;d be back soon. Then one day the button disappeared.<p>The only reason I use spottily over local music at this point is discovery, because they really do a great job at that.

            I never really got into Spotify because I found the UI so confusing, clearly designed for &quot;engagement&quot; instead of usability.<p>But this is perfect:<p>- search for the name of an album, press enter and voilà it plays the album in order like I expect<p>- Playback takes 1% CPU and 0.1% of RAM<p>- vim-ish bindings<p>- It even works with physical play&#x2F;pause&#x2F;next... keys on my keyboard<p>Thank you!

            Ripcord is excellent but you need to generate a new login token every few weeks. Sucks that these companies like slack and spotify et al. don&#x27;t just offer the tooling themselves that a subset of their customers clearly want.

            &gt; As I recall, shareware never did that. It violates the spirit of leaving the user alone, user automonomy.<p>Lots of shareware did and does that. It&#x27;s normal. It&#x27;s just an update check. It doesn&#x27;t self-update. It doesn&#x27;t transmit any information. No logs are collected.

            &quot;If it was off by default, most users would ask why it was off by default and why are they being tricked into being left to use outdated versions.&quot;<p>What evidence do you have to support this idea?  Is there somewhere we can view the feedback from this majority of users who believe they are being &quot;tricked&quot; into using &quot;outdated&quot; versions.  I have observed that developers are the ones who are desperate to push &quot;updates&quot;, to automatically install new code on the user&#x27;s computer with no user interaction required.  Users who bother to give feedback about software often complain about newer versions being not as good as the old ones.  They often question the nature of supposed &quot;improvements&quot;.<p>One of the things some shareware used to do, and software &quot;installers&quot; used to do in general, was to ask the user a series of questions to configure the settings before the first run of the program.  I am not suggesting that I prefer that approach, but the idea that someone would purport to believe that setting automatic update checks by default and acceptance of ongoing remotely controlled software installation by default is &quot;the norm&quot; just shows how today&#x27;s software authors make assumptions, and indeed engage in &quot;trickery&quot; through manipulation of defaults via &quot;dark patterns&quot;, that software authors in the past generally did not make.<p>Thats why a reference to &quot;shareware is coming back&quot; is, IMO, quite funny.  Today we have someone claiming he does not consider having an option off by default, and letting the user make the choice, as an alternative: &quot;I do not know what alternative there is.&quot;  The alternative is to let users turn  things on instead of forcing them to turn things off.   The &quot;opt out&quot; idea is an &quot;alternative&quot;, one adopted by online advertising and the reason the web is such a mess.  &quot;Opt out&quot; settings have a purpose and that purpose is not primarily for the users&#x27; benefit.

            Actually, you could just use use react (or vue or angular with nativescript) and have one codebase with a __native__ ui on desktop + css on the browser, but keep the app-logic and UI code the same.

            So right. As soon as you are the person paying for people and time to develop native apps, you start thinking, &quot;Geez, I could make an identical UI with web technologies and skip all the platform stuff entirely!&quot;<p>These apps are <i>identical</i> to native. Not one person could tell you the difference. The complaints about speed are nonsense, too. People don&#x27;t benchmark apps. They use them! These Electron and other web-wrapper apps are absolutely the future of all client-side app development.<p>If native apps are the railroad, web apps (w&#x2F; or without a wrapper, makes no difference), are the airplane.<p>BTW, there are many complaints about the Spotify UI, but does anyone ever complain that it&#x27;s a web-based UI? Who has ever said, &quot;Wow, I like Spotify but, ya know, it&#x27;s got a UI built with HTML and CSS and JS, so I don&#x27;t wanna use it.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not real. Proprietary app wrappers are proprietary because the companies that make them benefit from lockdown. They will always promote their locked-down platforms, and many enterprises have millions of dollars of <i>sunk costs</i> in these siloed application environments. The way out of prison is through web-based apps that run anywhere without the user even knowing or caring how that happens.

            What I don&#x27;t understand is: How many developers do you really need to create a native Spotify client?<p>My pet complaint is Google Chat, which is now a web app or a PWA. Seriously, I don&#x27;t believe that Google can&#x27;t afford to have three Mac developers assigned to Chat and create an awesome native application, rather than shipping that piece of junk PWA. Similarly I don&#x27;t buy that Slack, Facebook and Microsoft can&#x27;t hire or train the most bad-ass Mac or Windows developers to work on native versions of their products.

            On the desktop, I simply use a separate Firefox profile for Spotify with the web client. The only &#x27;special&#x27; thing is that I had to disable ServiceWorkers because they somehow caused some trouble every few weeks (dom.serviceWorkers.enabled = false). In addition, I use KDocker for a system tray icon.<p>However, on mobile it is a completely different story. The Spotify app requires so many resources that it takes forever to start (like a minute) and sometimes even causes my phone to reboot. For something like a MP3 player that is hilarious...<p>Does someone know if there is a good alternative mobile app?

            I am definitely going to check this out. I use the Spotify snap under Ubuntu as I never got Spotify client working when I upgraded to the lastest Ubuntu and they keep working on the main stable. I do not hate the UI of Spotify but having alternatives is really nice. I also have Spot installed. It is also a simple and native application to listen to your music. I am a very heavy Spotify user. We have a family subscription so my kids have their own premium. Last year I listened to 60K songs; I really like the yearly review BTW. Yesterday I was talking to my wife and we just swallowed the pill completely and we will be throwing out our CD collection to make room for a new cabinet (I currently own around 1000 CD&#x27;s).

            Is it just me or does the play buttons triange in the screenshot look horribly uncentered. Seems like the like positioned based on minimum&#x2F;maximum horizontal extend whereas aligning the &quot;center of gravity&quot; with the circle center might make more sense.

            It&#x27;s working just fine so far on Linux even it sounds like they&#x27;re mostly using MacOS. I could see using this a lot if playlist support was added. It seems snappy. I&#x27;m kind of surprised that htop reports 165M and Cpu reporting 38-45% which seems a tad bit high for playing a sound file O_O . I know it&#x27;s early days though, so I&#x27;ll keep an eye on it for sure. Very clean interface.

            I hope the team considers abstracting this codebase into a general framework after its reached a sufficient level of maturity.<p>Would be nice to have a growing ecosystem of high-performance, rock solid, cross-platform native app frameworks.

            Can you decouple the UI from Spotify and make a generic interface to plug in N streaming services? Then people could make a Spotify provider, a file provider, a Pandora provider, an Amazon music provider, etc.

            Just cloned and built this - was running within 3 minutes with no effort. On Windows. That&#x27;s unusual for native GUI apps to say the least.<p>Didn&#x27;t know Druid was even at this stage yet so that&#x27;s nice to see. It&#x27;s definitely living up to the goal of 60fps smooth resizing.

            Thank you! I took some time off after finishing my last full-time commitment, and wanted to cut my teeth on Rust a little bit -- exploring how feasible building cross-platform native apps is right now. So I&#x27;ve started building something that I&#x27;m missing and would like to use. Combine this with the pandemic, and here we are.

            Everyone hates slow, laggy, shitty software. The average consumer just has no insight as to why their software experience is bad. But don’t be fooled. A snappy, smooth experience does matter to consumers. Even when they can’t even quantify why one app “feels good” and another “feels bad”.

            And your point is?<p>Is 20fps fast enough for a video game? 30? 60? 90? 120? 240?<p>It’s subjective and relative. That doesn’t mean it isn’t important or meaningful.

            Why the hell is there not a stateful GUI markup standard? Mice and desktops did not go away with the advent of mobile. They are still the bread and butter of business, for example.<p>Thus, rather than reinvent the GUI adapter wheel for each and every programming language, let&#x27;s form a dynamic GUI markup standard based on existing open-source kits to avoid starting from scratch (Typically Tk, Qt, or WinForms. WinForm&#x27;s base is OSS, believe it or not.)<p>Then languages can read and write markup (XML or JSON text) to have GUI&#x27;s instead of glue on some screwy binary addon.
