            The cause is us. This has been in the works for decades, and we’ve been warned about it since the 70s. Governments just haven’t paid attention because they only care about the _now_ not the future.<p>I’ve seen how fucked our oceans have become since I was young. More debris in areas I never saw plastics before. Snorkeling is more depressing than ever.<p>We can potentially turn this around, but the oceans that we knew twenty years ago are long gone.<p>Act now or life is gonna be that much harder in fifty years.<p>I’m pretty cynical at this point though.

            Specifically the governments of Asia need to stop dumping plastic directly into the ocean. Even if they polluted at them same level as the rest of the world, it would be a huge success. But then the rest of the world and the oil industry also deserves blame for spreading the myth of plastic recycling.

            The west is also responsible for producing and glamorizing extremely wasteful lifestyles. We could have bulk food grocery stores where you can bring re-used glass jars but instead everything is wrapped in multiple layers of plastic meant to be tossed as soon as the product is consumed. The USA has pushed an extremely materialistic lifestyle that has driven the mass manufacture of plastic waste. Western countries need to take responsibility for the waste we produce instead of sending it “away” to be somebody else’s problem.<p>Edit: Just expanding on glass jars - I started saving all of my glass jars about a year ago. My shelf of jars is overflowing now, and they have many uses. I use peanut butter jars to hold my daily smoothie. I make candles with the jam jars.<p>We know the plastics industry pushed disposable products hard. And to me it speaks to a broader problem with US business logic - lie cheat and steal at any cost and that is &quot;good&quot; for society. There may be unseemly actions down the waste stream but we are responsible for the culture that produces so much trash.

            Re-used containers means reduced food-life after buying it or more preservatives, and higher chance of contamination. That will increase probability of food-poison. More wastage, more food needs to be produced, more environmental impact<p>On the topic of reusing bags, I wish it were as simple as stopping using single-use plastic bags. The most &quot;environmental-friendly&quot; alternative seems to be reusable-bags made of polyester PET(recycled), but you still have to reuse them on average more than ~35 times in order to have less environmental impact. graph: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;grocery-bag-environmental-impact" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;grocery-bag-environmental...</a><p>more info: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;faq-on-plastics#are-plastic-alternatives-better-for-the-environment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;faq-on-plastics#are-plastic-alter...</a><p>&quot;In fact, studies have shown that when we compare environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and resource use, plastic packaging tends to have a net positive impact. The impact of plastic production and handling is lower than the impacts which would result from food waste without packaging.&quot;

            Similar situation when ditching plastic or composites for glass bottles. You need a large number of reuses of the glass container (break-even at around 30-50 reuses) or you will actually end up with a net increase in emissions. Recycling glass should be a last resort, as it requires a lot of energy (compared to e.g. recycling PET bottles). Because glass is so much heavier than plastic packaging, transport distances also need to be kept low (good in general). If transport distance exceeds something like 500 km, a glass bottle will always result in higher net emissions than a tetra pack, even if reused a billion times.

            But it&#x27;s not just about emissions. Throw glass in a hedge, and it&#x27;s pretty inert: a shiny rock. Throw plastic in a hedge, and it&#x27;ll drift and get stuck around something, or get eaten by something that really shouldn&#x27;t be eating it, or break up into tiny pieces and poison the entire food chain… likely all three, and more.

            The biggest issue with plastic stuff in the wild is that things get stuck in it, especially marine wildlife, and birds and some other animals getting digestive problems when tearing it apart and eating it.<p>On the flip side, most plastic packaging (mainly PE and PP) is non-toxic and biology doesn&#x27;t really interact with it at all, even if you reduce it to microplastics.

            No. Like I said, PE and PP - which are the vast majority of plastic packaging, especially for foods, because the materials you are referring to are not food-safe in the first place - are biologically inert.<p>In fact, the monomers of PE and PP (ethylene and propene) are also not toxic, which is uncommon (compare with e.g. PVC: vinylchloride is toxic in all sorts of ways, polystyrol: styrene is also toxic in a few ways and damages DNA, teflon: it&#x27;s monomer is also a carcinogen). This is important, because making plastics generally leaves precursors in the finished product: the more the worse the process control is, which costs money and requires know-how.<p>See e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;23862761&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;23862761&#x2F;</a> for a study looking at whether these are EDC; they&#x27;re not: &quot;There were no significant differences between test and control groups in vagina or uterine weight. Data suggest that effluents from plastic food containers do not appear to produce significant adverse effects according to Hershberger and uterotrophic assays.&quot;<p>The single most problematic plastic for health purposes is PVC. PVC in its chemically pure form (difficult to do) isn&#x27;t bad, either. But pure PVC is a hard, brittle plastic, which is not that useful. So most PVC products consist of a large portion of plasticizer; some products (e.g. cables and other types of very soft PVC) are actually more plasticizer than PVC both by weight and volume. Both PVC and toxic paints are a popular choice for all kinds of toys.

            Re-using glass containers is actually an extremely low chance of contamination.  We have had easy glass sterilization techniques for a long time (most dishwashers have a sanitization cycle).  Further, your shelf life won’t be significantly reduced, unless you just don’t clean your containers.<p>The underlying argument you were responding to wasn’t really greenhouse gas focused. The discussion was mostly about plastic waste in the oceans and our environment. While it is possible the greenhouse gas budget is better with plastic, this doesn’t address the problem of accumulating forever waste within our environment.

            On the topic of bulk grocery shops, it would be really great if more people shop there (I’m in Vienna and we have a few but they’re struggling) but realistically, i don’t think the general crowd is ready to make such a drastic lifestyle change.I would be happy enough if supermarkets at least try and encourage people to go for the packaging free option, or provide incentives in this regard. It’s ridiculous and nonsensical that they charge more for you to buy your groceries loose aka without packaging. It’s like they’re punishing you for not going for the packet of 6 Granny Smith apples all wrapped in plastic and cardboard.

            &gt;It’s like they’re punishing you for not going for the packet of 6 Granny Smith apples all wrapped in plastic and cardboard.<p>I&#x27;ve always run on the gut assumption that they must be putting the worst apples that still look appealing into those packages.

            The packaging has a barcode so it can be scanned faster at a checkout. Faster scanning means less checkouts and staff which means lower capital and operating costs.

            Same! Or if I have to use one of their bags I put all the fruit and veg in the same bag and all the tags on it. Realistically it’s even less work for the cashier to scan everything all at once on one bag rather than pick up multiple packages and scanning them individually, so they have no excuse, really!

            I could care less about bulk supermarkets, and I don’t really think they’re a great answer. If anything, they may be worse in some ways.<p>For me, it’s the packaging. Japan is a great example of this.<p>Think of a banana, or an orange. Perfect package right? Now wrap them in plastic. Then when you buy them, they’re placed in a plastic bag. Sometimes each individual banana is wrapped individually... with plastic.<p>That’s Japan. That’s a lot of Asian countries, in fact.

            At least for fruits an vegetables most things at Billa and Spar are individual items you have to pick yourself and they strongly discourage those plastic bags.
That&#x27;s, unfortunately, not the case for literally every other item in their stores tho

            Yeah but it’s annoying because I know there are people who would literally buy the package of 6 apples just cos it’s on a special promo. If it’s almost equivalent to the price of 2&#x2F;3 apples, why not, right? And then they end up binning the rest that they can’t eat. So much food waste it’s crazy. They need to be more conscious in their decisions.

            It is well known that Americans consume far more natural resources and live much less sustainably than people from any other large country of the world. “A child born in the United States will create thirteen times as much ecological damage over the course of his or her lifetime than a child born in Brazil,” reports the Sierra Club’s Dave Tilford, adding that the average American will drain as many resources as 35 natives of India and consume 53 times more goods and services than someone from China.<p>Source : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blueridgeoutdoors.com&#x2F;go-outside&#x2F;united-states-consumption&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blueridgeoutdoors.com&#x2F;go-outside&#x2F;united-states-c...</a>

            As a father of three American kids, I see this first hand. I read (I think it was in Minimalist Parenting) that the average American kid has something like 40x the number of toys of the Average kid from a developing country. Dunno if it’s true, but I think it’s in the right ballpark.<p>My wife and I have tried to minimize waste. We generally buy used, etc. We have also tried to buy mostly non-plastic toys. But man, is it an uphill battle.<p>People just love to give us random stuff. For example, my dad rants about “Cheap Chinese crap”, but then turns around and buys my kids “Cheap Chinese crap” even after I’ve made it clear that I want less clutter in our lives.<p>There is a constant pressure on American parents to give their kids toys &#x2F; experiences &#x2F; entertainment. It comes from observing the frenetic activity of other parents, from targeted ads, from everywhere. But the fact is, kids just need to have a childhood. They don’t need their days stuffed with scheduled activities, the latest toys, etc. Just idle time, imagination, and quality attention from loving parents (Just a little attention everyday goes a long way.)<p>&#x2F;rant<p>Anyway, advice on how to exit the American way is very much welcome.

            &gt; Anyway, advice on how to exit the American way is very much welcome.<p>We&#x27;ve made a big deal about giving the kids &quot;experience gifts&quot;.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s lessons (my daughter got a week at a horseback riding camp, my son got dirt bike lessons). Sometimes it&#x27;s a trip (we&#x27;ve taken the kids on 3 separate cross-country road trips with tons of stops at national parks). Sometimes it&#x27;s a pass to a water park or minigolf place. The kids get involved in the experience they want, so they&#x27;re emotionally invested and it doesn&#x27;t feel forced for them. The only rule really is that the thing can&#x27;t be about electronics (i.e. no going to a video arcade).<p>Once we established that, we asked that grandparents do the same. Usually this is each set of grandparents taking the kids for a week or more in the summer, but they get creative sometimes.<p>It&#x27;s been four years and the kids are much happier with this than the random junk, and have said so.

            Ask for books. Tell your family that your children have enough toys, but what they&#x27;re really missing out on is stories and games to play, and knowledge about the world. Maybe throw in a “computer games and internet are bad” if you think it&#x27;ll fit your target audience.

            The number of toys or things is a misleading metric.<p>I have a toddler, and she has likely has 50x the number of toys, but 99% of them are recycled gifts that were handed off to us, or obtained through groups like our local BuyNothing, or from neighbors.  Her book collection of children&#x27;s books, and sing-along books is pretty astounding, but we didn&#x27;t buy a single one.<p>Much of our toddler clothes, and baby clothes was likewise donated to us from local families that outgrew them, as fast growing children can wear smaller sizes for just a few months.  When all of our kids have outgrown them, we plan on sharing them likewise.

Developed countries leading by example and demonstrating that sustainable development is profitable and successful is the only way to transform the current situation into a future in which the « polluting stage of development » is understood as being only a transient phase of development and not an end state.

            Meanwhile, nearly every possible vegetable and fruit is wrapped in plastic when bought at a supermarket in Switzerland. It’s infuriating. They have their own skin and are sold by weight. Why do we need to wrap them in plastic??

            China used to buy plastic waste from the west (95% of Europe and 70% of USA&#x27;s plastic waste). China isn&#x27;t some poverty stricken unaccountable backwater where it was just being dumped, they were explicitly engaging in contracts and giving good rates for backhaul routes on cargo ships. If they then mismanaged the waste after they took ownership of it, that&#x27;s China&#x27;s failing.<p>China have since mostly banned that, which sounds like what <i>China</i> needed to do to reign in their incapable plastic recycling industry. So that&#x27;s fine, but the problem remains that about 80% of ocean plastic waste comes from Asia. Almost 40% from The Philippines alone even when most of the west&#x27;s waste was going to China.  So this can&#x27;t be handwaved away as being due to &quot;the west&quot;, it&#x27;s a systemic problem in many countries in Asia in particular.

            Asia does not just mean « China ». Canada has been sending its plastic to the Philippines, where it is constantly mismanaged and ends up in the ocean (edit: not helped by the fact that Canada’s plastic was full of household garbage making it impossible to recycle properly anyway, see [1]) . Is it Philippines fault for mismanaging ? Sure, but it has been public for a long time and Canada kept sending plastic over there knowing full well what would happen with it. But it doesn’t matter because no one will blame plastic coming from Asia’s river on Canada.<p>Same story applies to India’s ship dismantling industry, where tons of damaging materials ends up in the ocean. Do we stop sending our ships there ? Of course not, because it doesn’t matter no one will blame Carnival for that.<p>We are not paying for recycling we are paying for environment damage laundering, so that at home we can display impressive lies such as « 98% of Canadian plastic is recycled » or whatever.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Canada–Philippines_waste_dispute" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Canada–Philippines_waste_dis...</a>

            &gt; Asia does not just mean « China »<p>Thanks I know, but that&#x27;s where the vast majority of the west&#x27;s waste went when we still had big pollution problems with other countries.

            Did you read the link? The Philippines seems to have had adequate inspection regulations, disputed the contract they had with this private company via legal channels, and Canada reciprocated by amending their laws to be able to receive the shipments back and The Philippines kept up pressure until that was done and it seems to be considered settled.<p>Dealing with other people&#x27;s plastic is easy because there is demand and money in it for you. Dealing with your own isn&#x27;t quite so interesting that way -- that&#x27;s what they need to be encouraged to do.

            That&#x27;s a better question for you to answer, since the incident you brought up contradicts the point you were hoping to make.<p>And I know how things work in The Philippines, I&#x27;ve lived there for some years, I&#x27;ve driven past the the shanty villages built on landfills and the storm drains filled with garbage.

            That&#x27;s utter rubbish, &quot;right to point fingers&quot;? A problem does not somehow become not a problem when the observer (or pointer-outer) changes.

            The governments of Asia need to stop dumping plastic into the ocean ? I’m pretty sure it’s the people, not « governments », who are dumping plastic on the land, which gets washed down the rivers into the ocean.<p>I agree that the blame is not always 100% on individuals.

            Yes and no. You need a proper functioning garbage disposal system first. I&#x27;ve visited places in countries where the people could shop plastic wrapped items en masse but the government failed to provide proper garbage disposal. What are these people supposed to do? They get their food wrapped in plastic but have no way of disposing of said plastic other than dumping it in nature.

            I assume their situation is made difficult by a huge population on tropical, (mountainous?) islands. Do they have reasonable locations for landfill?<p>Could other countries apply tariff-based pressure based on plastics detection at river mouths, and help with any methods of addressing the problem? There was a comment the other day that plastics in food&#x2F;bev wrappers was one issue. Surely these are not unsolvable problems with a bit more motivation?<p>Also wouldn&#x27;t hurt to publicise the info about ocean plastics coming from their islands (like your comment) and hopefully that encourages change also.

            The problem is we incorrectly assume that if we build something other cultures will just use it.

            Right! If the US (or some coalition of nations) recognized this problem and came to an agreement with the Philippines to handle waste management... it would probably be cheaper to handle it on their behalf for 100 years while the country continues to develop rather than try to force a culture change from the outside.<p>Many developing nations don&#x27;t worry about climate change because frankly they have a lot of shit going on. Manila has a very low quality of life. Would the US have listened to any outsiders if they started complaining to us about smoke during the industrial revolution, the dust bowl, the depression?

            We don&#x27;t know what the cause is. From the article:<p>Scientists are now scrambling to figure out what is killing these 40-foot-long marine mammals. The “what” is anything but obvious.<p>Some scientists believe there may be too many whales for the population to sustain itself. Others say this explanation of “overcapacity” and “natural causes” overlooks the gantlet of hazards that grays now face — including ecosystem alteration, ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, plastics pollution, disease, ocean acidification and loss of kelp forests.

We <i>do</i> know that we cause massive, let&#x27;s say, &quot;alterations&quot; to the oceans by acidification and plastic pollution alone, and there is very strong indication that the effects of those alterations are not positive.<p>So the worst case when addressing those issues is that we have solved or at the very least ameliorated acidification and plastic pollution, only to find out that gray whales dying specifically was not covered by those causes.<p>Yes, finding out the actual cause is important (there may be other issues we are not yet aware of), but prioritizing the recovery of the ocean <i>in general</i> is not exactly a waste of effort in the meantime. As an analogy, if a bathroom smells like excrement, fixing the toilets known to overflow is a suitable activity. If it still smells like excrement after, or if you discover a different cause while the toilets are being fixed, you&#x27;re still glad you fixed those toilets.

            I agree, the &quot;we don&#x27;t know that the cause is&quot; type of answer makes me think of those doctors saying back in the days that we didn&#x27;t know whether smoking cigarettes caused health issues.<p>There&#x27;s something called common sense and it&#x27;s whatever contradicts common sense that deserves a clear explanation&#x2F;evidence.

            Troubleshooting is very much like science.<p>If you are trying to fix the problem, finding the cause is very important. By just doing something, or worst many somethings, you may make the problem worse and still have no clue of how to fix it.<p>Now something like this is a little harder because it is not just trying to fix a problem, it is trying to fix a problem with a time limit. Similar to emergency medicine. But harder because the patient is one who&#x27;s anatomy and physiology you are not familiar with. And they might have reactions to the medicine you are giving them.<p>The article keeps hinting at lack of food, malnourished, feeding in unusual places.

&gt;Refusal to blame yourself with literally 0 evidence is itself evidence that someone is an oil company shill or something.<p>Is very hostile and breaks the guideline:

            I don&#x27;t know that questioning this idiom breaks the guidelines.<p>If not a shill it sounds like an ask for more resources, to save the gray whales or study the oceans, or something.<p>Either way, &quot;a precise cause has yet to be determined&quot; seems to be playing a little too close to the vest, and can be true without being especially meaningful.<p>&quot;Bad ocean management&quot; turns out to be more of a triage problem and less blue-sky research for the sake of knowledge.

            Ship strikes have been increasing over the years now as our ever-growing global economy depends on maritime transport.<p>The scientists are working on good solutions but it might be too late, too many ships travel too fast these days[0].<p>They also mention this in the article:<p>In a study published this year, a research team found that a variety of whales face risk of ship strikes. That was illustrated in May, when two fin whales came to port in San Diego, plastered to the hull of an Australian warship.<p>But of all whales in the Pacific, grays are the most likely to be struck by ships, the study concluded. “Risk appeared greatest during south- and northbound migration when much of the gray whale population is moving through waters near shore” — places with “high vessel densities,” the study found.<p>According to a NOAA database, 205 gray whales were killed by vessels between January 2016 and December 2020 in the eastern Pacific.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcasts.google.com&#x2F;feed&#x2F;aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9xdFVjWnZzWA&#x2F;episode&#x2F;ODA4YmExMGUtYjU3MC00N2NlLTkwOTktMDcyNWMxNGRkYzUz?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjQptjlh7fyAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&amp;hl=en-CA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcasts.google.com&#x2F;feed&#x2F;aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGV...</a>

            The cause isn&#x27;t known. It&#x27;s probably us, but saying &quot;it&#x27;s us&quot; isn&#x27;t helpful. Finding out the reason is helpful.<p>It&#x27;s hard enough to make changes to global human behavior when we have a well-defined problem with a known solution. Guessing at a cause and getting it wrong--or making hand-wavy statements about how the entirely of human behavior is a problem--not only doesn&#x27;t help anything, it actively hurts efforts to solve problems.<p>If you present people with evidence and with a pragmatic plan to solve a problem, they&#x27;re more likely to act. Obviously we get it wrong far more often than we get it right, but there are success stories, like saving many birds from extinction by banning DDT.<p>If you can&#x27;t come up with a cause and a solution, you just come off as a crank. If you get the cause wrong or your solution doesn&#x27;t work, that makes it all the harder to win support for the million other things that need fixing.

            While I&#x27;d say anyone ruling out man made causes of these whales&#x27; deaths would be demonstrating severe cognitive dissonance, isn&#x27;t it equally likely to be a disease or something not man made? Why does every bad thing that happens have to be caused by man? They could have a virus that jumped to them, something along those lines, just like out pandemic (which, I&#x27;ve heard, is not man made, and about the only problem plaguing this earth that people are adamantly sure isn&#x27;t). There are literally millions of other species they interact with besides us, many of which could cause this.<p>Maybe do the science before we jump to conclusions?

            The oceans are dying. Solving this problem should be a priority, but the effects are too complex and not immediately visible enough for people to care. I fear that by the time the effects will noticeably endanger humanity, not only will it be too late, people still might not understand the causation.

            Most likely the root cause is acidification of the ocean. Increasing the carbon dioxide in the ocean decreases the ph level of water, making it more acidic. While some animals and plants have evolved to handle highly acidic environments, most have not, and in general acid tends to be bad for living creatures. I know I&#x27;m oversimplifying things, but this seems reasonable. I assume if there were giant balls of plastic pollution in the whales belly this would be found in an autopsy and therefore plastic pollution is probably not the root cause.

            Did you mean to reply to me? I did not ascribe a single cause. What you say makes sense, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to say that only a single cause is present. Although prioritizing the biggest problem first seems reasonable of course, my fear is that we don&#x27;t prioritize any of it in time...

            Humans are the cause, and unless more governments and policies are in place to prevent excessive plastic and waste consumption, there isn’t a hope for wildlife.<p>I do freelance work for a reusable takeaway container company where restaurants stock our boxes and customers need only to download an app to get their food in reusable boxes (they can return anywhere). The app is super easy to download but still people are refusing to do it. I tried convincing a pregnant acquaintance to do it, telling her to think of the planet she’s leaving behind for her unborn child, and still she refused. Why? Convenience. So much easier to throw the damn plastic box away and tell yourself “oh it’s made of recycled plastic anyway.”<p>The fact is, whether it’s recycled plastic or not, plastic is plastic. Driving the demand for recycled plastic boxes isn’t going to fix our planet. Until the government steps in to say every food related shop needs to provide a reusable alternative and customers have to pay more for disposable waste (like how it is now with carrier bags in most supermarkets in Europe), I don’t see much change happening in terms of wildlife. It’s sad but it is what it is.

            If plastic is as recyclable as plastic manufacturers would have us believe, we could impose a ban on the production of new plastic after a short transitional period. Try suggesting that to anyone with an interest in the plastic production or consumption complex and see how they respond.<p>Even if one wanted to recycle all the plastics they use, it&#x27;s damn near impossible. Firstly, what is and isn&#x27;t &quot;currently&quot; recycled is not particularly transparent to the end-user. Your local authority (or privatised collection company in the case of businesses) might have a confusing set of rules and guidelines on how to dispose of different types of plastic (which to most regular folk are just &quot;plastic&quot;). Whoever&#x27;s collected the waste probably doesn&#x27;t deal with it themselves but sells it on, and then it&#x27;s a gamble as to whether that 3rd party recycles it, ships it off to a poorer territory, or just burns it.

            Exactly. I&#x27;m very skeptical about the percentage of plastic that is supposedly recycled. Furthermore, even if the plastic is actually recycled, most plastics e.g. polypropylene can only be recycled once.

            In our case we have to make people download the app, as we can then track how long they&#x27;ve had it and this also ensures the return the box. However, we&#x27;ve also realized that not many people are as tech-savvy as we are, especially the older generation, so we need to think about other alternatives soon if we want this to be feasible.

            Yeah, totally feel you about the data and downloading the app, that&#x27;s actually a really good point that I didn&#x27;t think about! Unfortunately as the boxes are made from food-grade stainless steel, they are worth more than the 2 euros, maximum 5 euros that we would charge as deposit. The risk of people keeping them and losing the 2 euros is fairly high. On the other hand, making it more than 5 euros would deter people from paying, so it&#x27;s a dilemma at the moment.

            There totally is, power budgeting is a very common thing. But you need an incentive to apply it first, otherwise it&#x27;s just ignored if it stands in the way for shipping. Smartphones for example always have that because they run on battery power and runtime is a big factor. But we need to apply this to more than just battery powered devices with long runtime needs.

            Those are marked on that page as &quot;Aboriginal subsistence catches&quot;:<p><i>&quot;In some parts of the world, whale products play an important role in the nutritional and cultural life of native peoples.  Four IWC member countries conduct aboriginal subistence hunts today: Denmark (Greenland), Russia (Chukotka), St Vincent and the Grenadines (Bequia) and the United States (Alaska and also potentially a resumption of hunts previously undertaken by the Makah Tribe of Washington State).&quot;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iwc.int&#x2F;aboriginal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iwc.int&#x2F;aboriginal</a><p>Looks like they manage allocations based on whale populations. The gray whale&#x27;s conservation status is marked as &quot;Least Concern&quot;.<p>The article submitted to HN notes that grey whales are fairly numerous, and I&#x27;d say these recent incidents are a canary-in-coal-mine scenario.

            We all want to find a reason why our ocean populations are depleting, but as soon as anyone says China, you&#x27;re racist (mainly from people on the left, too). This way of thinking and the resulting inaction is going to kill them even faster.

            That&#x27;s not true, rogue Chinese trawling fleets fishing illegally are quite widely and openly discussed - there&#x27;s no real doubt that they exist and have little incentive to bother fishing sustainably. What <i>is</i> frowned upon is just pointing the finger at &quot;China&quot; in general without being specific or even at least a little self-aware. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of pushback on that, and tbh it&#x27;s pretty fair.

            &gt; Something is killing gray whales<p>The article showed a real maturity for the media. It was specific, not whales, grey whales.<p>If you want to know why they are dying look at the comments.<p>They <i>don&#x27;t</i> care. Many can&#x27;t even be bothered to mention whales. Mostly not one iota of care is given to grey whales.<p>This is the war to be fought. The environmentalist, they are destroying the plant one species at a time.  They won&#x27;t win, but we will lose much while the environmental machinery ploughs as much as it can into the ground to keep it&#x27;s control.
