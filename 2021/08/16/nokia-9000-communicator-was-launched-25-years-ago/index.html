            I used to work as product manager in a major telco and had one of every single model of those, and they were some of the best hardware I ever used.<p>The peak was, I think, when I accessed Excel over Citrix while sitting in the airport waiting for a flight.<p>In comparison, the N900 I have sitting in the bottom of a storage box someplace was a major disappointment--Maemo never came close to delivering half the functionality I had in a 9500, even though the design principles were pretty advanced for that time.<p>(I strongly recommend reading &quot;Operation Elop&quot; for an idea of what that later stage in Nokia&#x27;s life was like, and why Maemo tanked: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asokan.org&#x2F;operation-elop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asokan.org&#x2F;operation-elop</a>)<p>But the 9000 series was definitely something I wish we had today in some usable, non-niche form.

            Maemo wasn&#x27;t the problem, and in fact N900 had a dedicated cult following for years after.<p>Nokia spectaculary blew its own foot with deprecating Maemo after only a few months - either the stupidest move in history or result of internal power struggles - and force-marrying it with Intel&#x27;s Moblin (itself a decent mobile OS) to create unholy mess that was Meego.<p>The book (btw awesome find, gonna read it at the first chance I get!) agrees with my recollection of the events:<p>&gt;  The operating system was named Maemo. As soon as it was
permitted to be fitted on a phone, that first Maemo smartphone was a reasonable success. It attracted a community of open source developers who created Maemo apps. With 12,000 members, this was the largest mobile developer community in the world. Then Nokia did something remarkable. It partnered with the chip manufacturer Intel, and the two companies renamed Maemo to
MeeGo.<p>Consider Maemo was Debian-based, using GTK, and Moblin was RedHat-based, using QT. It not only meant Nokia had to rewrite its proprietary UI and repackage everything, it also threw all the thriving dev community under the bus.

            Coincidentally, I was just reading something related to this debacle here - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workplace.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;177611" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workplace.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;177611</a> - too. And I do wonder how Nokia&#x27;s future would have been different if they had fully focused on Meego &#x2F; Sailfish OS instead of adopting Windows Mobile Platform. (Sailfish OS was developed by ex-Nokia developers).

            Being at Nokia Networks during that last phase, I could observe in first person how many of those things went.<p>Nokia used to have internal shows to get employees feedback for future products, Maemo not having a radio modem was a common remark, naturally they couldn&#x27;t add it due to Symbian.<p>Also think that Elop gets more blame than he deserves, as many see his connection to Microsoft and not the bonus from Nokia&#x27;s own management board.<p>NetAct versus other networking products, also suffered from the same culture issues, by the way.

            I appreciated the N900 (still have one), but Nokia caught my eye and then interest in the smartphone area before that, as I bought an E61 in an airport in Germany, while on my way back to the US. Once back to work I configured it as skinny (SCCP, actually) client to my Cisco CUCM, and amazed all my peers about being able to pick up my phone extension, over WiFi, on my cell phone.

            Out of interest I just had a look on eBay to see what Nokia 9500s go for and... wow. The answer is, kind of, proper money. As in, hundreds of pounds for unlocked models in good condition. Might not sound like that much in an era where premium flagship phones typically cost £1000-1500, but still pretty nuts for a phone that was released all the way back in 2004. I guess for a retro collector with the right sort of fetish this is reasonable[0].<p><i>[0] Btw, I&#x27;m absolutely not dissing this: I have my own fetish - something of a thing for old synths, particularly those of the early-ish digital era in the 80s that are still fairly affordable, and recently bought a Yamaha RX5 drum machine... from Australia. It wasn&#x27;t _that_ expensive, but it&#x27;s a similar level of expenditure. I love old analogue synths too: I just can&#x27;t afford them and, with these, because they&#x27;re a bit more sexy and fashionable than the digital options, you can often pick up much less expensive modern day reproductions and homages.</i>

            I have Dyslexia, which in me mostly surfaces as confusion of the various theirs, and a writing speed which would result in me never completing any class work. I dealt with that by learning to type, after which all my work was done on organiser type devices, first an Amstrad NC100, and then later on a Psion Series 5mx.<p>The Psion was such a lovely device, it would fit in a large pocket, but had a proper keyboard that you could comfortably type at a decent speed on. It was also my introduction to programming, and so probably indirectly responsible for me coming out of school with reasonable grades (having been able to actually finish work), and a career I&#x27;m still in twenty years later.

            Yeah, me and a friend of mine got one from a shop, I think they were like €15 or €25,- at the time - pretty steep for pocket money, but not impossible. I mean we didn&#x27;t actually use it much and since it only had a two line LCD screen, entering e.g. school schedules and contact information into it was a bit painful, but it was a neat gadget to have.<p>I have it in the drawer near my PC at the moment, I think I put in a battery the other day, still works.<p>Later on I bought a secondhand Palm V from the internet, I think it was €25,- that thing was pretty cool and more of the &#x27;smartphone&#x27; functionality than the organizer; you could install apps on it and the like, so Sudoku was a favorite.

            I had an N900- for me one of the main downsides of it was the touchscreen, it was fine but with my colleagues all using the HTC hero it was frustrating to set their devices up for them and see how much nicer the experience was with multitouch.<p>Very solid device otherwise- i went from an Xperia X1 to the N900.

            There are Android keyboards that replicate it. I tried a few but for whatever reason they still couldn&#x27;t replicate the experience. I suspect it&#x27;s the lack of hard buttons - I could type out an entire message without looking at the screen with a T9 keypad.<p>I&#x27;ve ended up switching to a swipe keyboard which I find efficient but it in an entirely different way to T9.

            For some inexplicable reason new Nokias seem to have ditched T9. The one feature that gives &#x27;dumb&#x27; phones an edge over touchscreens has been abandoned. The replacement is a horrid, crappy and eminently useless home - grown editor that is worse in every way. It seems Nokia execs enjoy shooting themselves in the foot. But anyway, their phones are irrelevant, it&#x27;s just a pity that they seem to be going backwards.

            The Microsoft-Nokia didn&#x27;t want to maintain the old OSs so went with a licensed clone of Series 30, and then post-Microsoft went with KaiOS (though newer ones seem to be back on the Series 30 clone, which is frankly a better experience than KaiOS was).  Like, I was never a big fan of Series 30 or 40 but they had an awful lot of iterative improvement over the years and they just pissed that all away.

            KaiOS (if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called) is crap and almost unusable. The Symbian series and more basic OSs were pretty complete and nice to use. Nokia no longer make good phones, or even mediocre phones.

            No I loved those buttons, and find miss-touching a screen so much easier! I could bash out messages on my Nokia 8250 without looking at all, and could type away with the phone in my bag. I&#x27;d love to know what my typing speed was actually like back then, but it sure felt fast!

            I would say if you were going to elevate anything after the 9000 it should be the Symbian devices- i had a 6600 and a friend had a 6630 and those will to me always be the first &quot;Smartphones&quot;
We played downloaded multiplayer games over Bluetooth in school, and though mine didn&#x27;t have official mp3 functionality I downloaded the app used on later devices and used mine as an mp3 player. Even downloaded a bunch of roms for the ngage that ran just fine.<p>In the end though the peak for me was Windows mobile, everything up to 6.5 was literally just a pc in your pocket, after that they made the mistake (imo) of trying to compete with apple and android for user experience and failed miserably. For my part I never wanted the improved UX- a start menu style system with a stylus was great for me. Nokias N900 was great, but in the end too niche to compete with HTC and Apple when they were pumping out androids and iPhones. I handled purchases at my work for smartphones and gave the HTC hero as suggestion for my colleagues since it was simpler and got a N900 for myself, and though I liked it a lot android certainly went a lot further in the end.

            I can literally -- and I mean that word in the proper usage -- think of <i>nothing</i> in the N900 (or earlier models) that changed the world in any way.  And I still own, and occasionally use, my N800.<p>Prior to the iPhone the acme of portable touchscreen interface design was the Newton Messagepad 2100.  Its interface was superior to Maemo in practically every way, despite being discontinued ten years prior.<p>Maemo feels like a crappy, half-assed attempt to implement some of the Newton&#x27;s magic on top of X11, and with weird desktop mouse-oriented design elements (menus, scroll bars, combo boxes, Windows-style tree-views, even <i>cursors</i> in some apps) bolted on awkwardly without any thought about their appropriateness to a tablet operating system.  I wrote an extensive article comparing the two way back when, when I was doing a moderate number of contributions to the N800 platform.  Maemo was amateurish at best, with an incredible array of inconsistent and obtuse iconography, several inconsistent sizes and designs for the same exact kind of GUI element (text buttons, icons, ), a complete lack of state persistence, absolutely <i>horrible</i> fonts, and a desperate need to be backward compatible with <i>X11</i>, hardly the best choice for a mobile OS GUI foundation.  It was clearly built by linux software developers and not GUI designers.<p>iOS didn&#x27;t borrow anything from the N900: it borrowed directly from the Newton and from MacOS and NeXTSTEP, when it wasn&#x27;t inventing things from whole cloth.<p>Thankfully now Android has shown us that Linux can shine in the mobile pad market, if you jettison X, stupid archaic design elements from desktop GUIs, and design a consistent and organized interface from the ground up considering the needs of the device and and user.

            I think Nokias 7650 deserves also mention. Launched in 2001&#x2F;2002 it arguably laid the foundation for mainstream smartphones, while Communicators were inevitably doomed to be niche devices. 7650 had also many of the hallmarks of modern smartphone, at least compared to Communicators which were more of evolutionary dead end.

            The problem really at that time and even with PDAs after that like the Palm Trio was that mobile data services really sucked in most locations where these devices would potentially have done really well.  The Nokia had additional problems in that the first wifi model had terrible battery life and then Nokia started to ruin their operating system.  Blackberry had the right timing with regards to mobile data and right solutions to these problems and more including the keyboard and Exchange integration so they did really well for a while until Apple disrupted it and Android followed.

            Was the Communicator ever really influential? I was in a Nokia dominated market at the time and pagers and then blackberrys seemed to be what actually drove that side of the market. The Communicator was seen as a curiosity.

            It was a high-end device for businesses. The price range made  it almost completely out of the question for regular consumers, and it was never meant as a consumer device. But when it was introduced in 1996, sending e-mail and fax and being able to browse the web on mobile was definitely a huge thing for businesses. Mind you, the dial-up internet <i>just</i> had started booming a couple of years earlier. The communicator predated Blackberries, but continued as a product line until 2007. So while the products coexisted in the market, we&#x27;re still talking about different eras here.

            Sure there are decent smart phones that only costs 100 euros, but I was referring to the fact that in 1996 communicator was deemed too expensive for consumer market, but now top of the line iphones sell huge volumes.

            Phones have become so important in our lives. In 1996, you never needed the internet to do anything, as our society was based on other technologies. People could live their lives without the internet, or even without a mobile phone and it would be no problem at all.<p>Now the internet, and increasingly mobile internet is becoming the default way of accessing almost any service, so having a phone that works for you is something that people are ready to pay for. You end up using it so much, that people feel like it&#x27;s not a waste of money.

            You have to remember how ahead of its time the Communicator was. The first blackberry device was 3 years away and the first one that could make calls was 6 years away when the Communicator was released. It might not have been a huge sales success, but it did show where the mobile phone market was headed years before anybody else.

            Back in early 2000s I worked at company doing pharma CRM for emerging markets in rural places like central Africa, Mongolia and east Russia. We used Nokia commnicators as a client nodes for field representives.<p>The platform was really limited, app development was tricky, but at the end it did the job and there were very few alternatives.<p>We actually ended up using emails as our sync mechanism: internet connectivity in places we served were as limited as you can imagine and also because of device limitation. It worked in a way that changes in data were serialized and sent to server that merged the data into the master and sent you changes back via email as well.

            I don&#x27;t think so. I worked on software on the (later model) 9500 and it was <i>awful</i>. Sure, it had a browser, but even over wifi it took minutes to render pages.

            A friend of mine worked at a bank and used early Nokia Communicator to remotely administer machines including AS&#x2F;400. He could do it from his bed while on standby, or while on the go. An absolute game changer. That it had a browser is more of an afterthought. And of course it is slow; GPRS is slow. But if you use the text-based part, and were good with CLI, it was great. I never got to like very small keys, but for me a &#x27;full&#x27; qwerty keyboard is a huge upgrade over T9. I never liked nor used T9 much. I avoided it as much as I could.<p>I own a Planet Cosmo Communicator which is a homage to the Nokia Communicator (as well as Palm devices). I also purchased the successor, the Planet Astro Slide, which has a slideout keyboard like the (patented) Nokia N900 (among others, like Symbian-based). The keyboard of these devices is, like the Planet Gemini&#x27;s, great.<p>That said, I believe a smartphone like Nokia N95 was more of a game changer for the general consumer. And Nokia became popular because of their iconic dumbphones (and their networking pioneering, hence their name reference to town in Finland); not so much their smartphones.

            &gt; 25 years since it changed the world<p>Nokia’s Communicator may have been the most capable phone computer of the pre iPhone era, but it didn’t change the world.  It was too expensive, too closed, and not well enough marketed to change much of anything.<p>I’m surprised to see it glorified here, not because it wasn’t a nice piece of visionary tech, but because the company that made it had such little impact on changing the world despite pioneering the category.

            It feels a little far-fetched to suggest that one of the leading handset manufacturers putting out one of the very first &quot;smart devices&quot; had no influence on the future of smart devices that followed it, if you ask me.<p>Yes, they weren&#x27;t in the hands of every stylish adult or high-spending teen, but it wasn&#x27;t for them. I&#x27;d guarantee it influenced the thinking of other people building products in that category for at least a few years. And in the long run the world changed due to that product category.

            The communicator was literally like a toy IBM PC.<p>Blackberry innovated by shrinking the keyboard to thumb size, and making do with a smaller display so it could fit in a pocket instead of requiring a handbag.<p>Those two innovations&#x2F; bold compromises over the Communicator enabled RIM to discover the first addictive euphoria of an always connected social device with the crack berry.<p>I say “social” but it wasn’t really because the app was really just email. But RIM got it into the gossip columns through Paris Hilton and Janet Jackson, setting the stage for the blockbuster device that landed in 2007 when Steve Jobs showed everybody what a leap forward into a new category could be.

            Key for blackberry was as you say the one handed keyboard.  That I would add - great battery life, robust (could drop it without expending upon some military tested grade case) and above all.  They focused on the one internet application buisness needed - email on the go.<p>That right there gave them a winner in those early days.<p>Now what gave Blackberry there consumer base was the PIN messaging which was a basic chat system that was simple and effective, something a bit more for those that grew up on SMS to engage with and they did.

            I owned one of these, not as good as a Psion 5MX that preceded if year before.  Sure this was an all in one but no, always laughed at the ariel and the thing felt like you could almost use it as an ice-pick with the ariel folded down and the unit closed.  But hey, was neat - just the usual issues of these open&#x2F;close designs was the ribbon cable to connect the screen - those always seem to fail outside warranty period.<p>But crux was, this was too dam expensive and heck a few years later Blackberry would have it&#x27;s moment and that did more for the market than the Nokia communicator ever did.  Heck the IBM Simon did more than the Nokia did for pushing things or about the same lack-lustre uptake.   
FWIW I got my communicator for free from a friend who orded one and got two with the company failing to take back the second one in a period of time that made it legally his (he notified in writing so was 3months, maybe 6).<p>I would also ad the Sony P800 was more game changer as well than the nokia communicator.  Also owned that and for the era - pretty darn good.

            If openness is your thing, you can get a N900 and run a your own Linux on it. Or you can try getting the developers phone N950 on ebay,  which has more recent hardware.<p>If I was forced to use an old Nokia as my daily driver, I would probable use a 5800 instead.

            I suspect that the majority of users are not fans of typing in any form. Many of them immediately press the dictation button and tell the phone what they&#x27;d like to see. Many people&#x27;s idea of cool or fun is totally <i>not</i> an office in their pocket, but rather a TV &#x2F; music player &#x2F; camera &#x2F; game console. Plus a phone, of course, for talking by voice.<p>The target audience of Nokia 9000, people like you or me, are long since not the target audience of flagship smartphones. Bluetooth keyboards,  11&quot; laptops, or some highly custom and expensive hardware are the choices for a proper &quot;mobile office&quot; today.

            It&#x27;s quite a trip on the memory lane when I am still using Nokia as my phone. The times when Nokia was the giant of the phone industry.

            It didn&#x27;t change the world. The iPhone did 10 years later. I guess the article is of interest because it has this wrong claim weaved in and even at it&#x27;s time the &quot;Nokia Communicator&quot; wasn&#x27;t a big success. Maybe we didn&#x27;t know what FAANG-like success looks like at that time and everyone thought &quot;Nokia is such a respectable, successful company in Scandinavia&quot;. Probably the article is of interest now because, we didn&#x27;t see 2006 (year the iPhone came out) and all the years after.<p>Shrinking a laptop to the size of a telephone wasn&#x27;t the right thing to do.

            Yeah...I remember the iPhone release.  I was so jealous of the capacitive screen and solidly implemented graphics acceleration.  But compared to the HTC WinMo phone I had at the time, it was missing such futuristic capabilities as 3G data, GPS for turn-by-turn nav, 3rd party apps, copy&#x2F;paste, MMS, background apps, front camera (although it was less important because video calls on 2G was a non-starter), and the ability to even change your background or ringer to something that didn&#x27;t ship with the thing.<p>Definitely glad that others were soon to follow with the more modern displays, because the first iPhones themselves were like a step back in many other ways compared to the Palms, Blackberrys, and PocketPCs of the day.

Do you think they just had a preset number of programs and that&#x27;s it?<p>Windows Mobile (and even fking Pocket PC) had text editors, browsers, music and video players, file management and transfer tools, GPS software, painting tools, etc.<p>Granted, you needed three cells in your brain to, <i>gasp</i>, install apps yourself, but they were available.

            At the time Nokia was not derelict. It is stated in the heading, it is now 25 years ago when Nokia started its path to become a global juggernaut.
