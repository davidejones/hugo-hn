            You know. I&#x27;ve never been interested in these e-ink notebooks where you can write on a digital screen that acts like paper. I&#x27;ve always felt that actual pen and paper were superior.<p>However, if you add some good spaced repetition software to one of these e-notebooks then I think you will have finally surpassed pen and paper for note taking.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of something like, you take a note on a page and then save it. A week later the page of notes you wrote is presented to you again and you can draw boxes around parts of the page and blur &#x2F; hide bits of text, etc; these then become your spaced repetition items. I&#x27;ve heard of studies showing that hand written notes are superior for memory, this is the best of both worlds, hand written and then automatic spaced repetition.<p>And how much easier is it to surrender your life to a spaced repetition algorithm when it is it&#x27;s own dedicated device? The idea of being able to memorize math, and other visual information, in addition to the usual written content (which is, again, better remembered if hand written) is so promising I&#x27;d happily pay hundreds of dollars for such a device.<p>I know there are some fairly hackable e-ink tables out there, has anyone done this?

            I just want taking notes and then chopping those notes into spaced repetition items to be separate.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean present the entire page, although a link back to the entire page for context would be nice.<p>Also, being able to remember things by their spacial layout on the page is an advantage, not a flaw. It allows you to employ your spacial and visual memory to help in memorizing concepts and facts.

            We&#x27;re already there.<p>The reMarkable (by reports) and Onyx BOOX (by direct experience) both satisfy this requirement.<p>I picked up the BOOX as an e-book reader, not a note-taking device.  <i>It turns out that the note-taking functionality is really, really good.</i><p>I <i>still</i> have the objection that notes are stuck in an application-specific interface.  Though on balance that&#x27;s not all bad.<p>There&#x27;s also the inherent privacy risk of having an electronic rather than physical record.

            I&#x27;m using a remarkable 2 and the lag when writing is almost non-existent. The thing traditional paper has over the e-ink tablet is the ease of shuffling through notes. Sure, I can tag, and organize, and search through notebooks on my tablet, but shuffling through a stack of paper is much faster, without the friction of using a (sometimes clunky) e-ink ui.

            Well said and I agree. Everything most e-ink tablets do you can already do with paper and pencil, more or less. You can search your notes on the tablet, you can search your notes in a paper notebook, and with the paper notebook you can remember things like &quot;it&#x27;s towards the back, after X&quot;. You can manually tag your e-notes, reality automatically tags your physical notes with things like page wrinkles and spilled coffee stains. So, slightly different but ultimately quite similar for most people.<p>Again, I think spaced repetition is a killer feature that could finally distinguish an e-ink tablet from paper. I think this idea has more potential for improving learning than almost all the multi-million dollar learning websites out there. It can systematically take you to savant levels of recollection in any topic. And right now this tool is locked behind some clunky text focused UI. (Yes, latex and pictures exist, but they suck when compared to drawing on a page.)

            It&#x27;s 21 milliseconds one reviewer said. And remember, it&#x27;s a refresh happening under the stylus and under your fingers, so it&#x27;s not comparable to regular screen refresh times.

            The consensus within the Anki community seems to be that yes, the SuperMemo scheduling algorithm (SM-17) is a bit better than Anki&#x27;s (SM-2 variant), but not by enough to matter, so you shouldn&#x27;t worry about it.<p>But when you look into tests people have done to see how much better it is exactly, it&#x27;s around 30% more efficient.<p>I still use Anki and am grateful for its existence, but this is a huge difference in efficiency. I wish there was a better open source scheduling algorithm available.

            How come Anki cant update it itself? Is SM-17 just a different set of exponential-decay functions from SM-2? Is that even copyrightable?<p>Also, if Anki is open-source, I&#x27;m surprised that there is no unofficial port that uses SM-17. But maybe I&#x27;m just ignorant of how much work that would involve.

            Anki is great... however:<p>... having used it for the last 4 years to try to memorize vocabulary in certain languages (Spanish &amp; French, recently started Chinese), I think it&#x27;s a <i>base layer</i>... (much like how Bitcoiners like to talk about BTC&#x27;s Blockchain). Reasons:<p><pre><code>  1. I&#x27;ve tired of it. I need a layer that makes me excited to use it.

  2. I&#x27;ve found it far-far less useful for learning other things than rote vocabulary memorization. It needs a layer that makes it easy to store and &quot;pull up&quot; everything I need to know.
</code></pre>
That said, I don&#x27;t want to sound like I&#x27;m looking a gift-horse in the mouth. Anki truly is a great piece of software, and my sincere thanks to the devs.

            In my opinion people often make the mistake of using Anki to memorize one-to-one translations of foreign words. It is more effective to use it to learn the mapping of whole sentences.<p>For every word you want to learn, add a few idiomatic and representative sentences in Anki. You can do the same for every new grammatical concept you want to learn.<p>And don&#x27;t forget to use Anki&#x27;s text-to-speech tools to practice listening as well as speaking.<p>Does it replace other forms of learning entirely? No, but it can be a great component of learning a new language.

            Totally agree with this.<p>When learning Japanese grinding vocab was extremely boring but did a fantastic job of bridging the gap between textbook literature and actually being able to read simpler (middle school level) native literature &#x2F; comics &#x2F; news stories.<p>And I didn&#x27;t even need that many words to bridge that gap. Maybe like 1000 or so over what I&#x27;d already picked up from textbooks.<p>Now? There&#x27;s no way in heck I&#x27;m going back to grinding vocab and instead slowly pick up new words by reading tons and tons of books.<p>I still need to rote memorize a bunch of kanji since picking them up naturally is pretty brutal, but like with vocabulary I&#x27;ll only do it to the point where I can stumble through YA-level books without looking something up every other sentence.

            It&#x27;s much more fun to watch native video &#x2F; read native materials and put in whole sentences that are just on the tip of your foreign language understanding (i + 1 theory from stephen krashen).<p>Instead of just 1 to 1 vocab mapping, look for chinese tv shows that you enjoy and start to slowly build up vocabulary by mining sentences.<p>Then when you do reviews, not only will you remember the vocabulary, you will also remember when it occurred in the story and have a cool memory of some of your favorite tv shows &#x2F; books &#x2F; etc.

            I&#x27;ve used Anki every day for almost a year now for Spanish vocabulary. My deck has over 4000 cards. Most are one-to-one translations of nouns and verbs, but some are phrases and Spanish idioms.<p>To your first point, it has basically become a habit for me. The key is to really commit to it for the first several weeks and establish the habit, then you won&#x27;t feel tired of it as reviewing your cards daily becomes something you &quot;just do&quot;.<p>Definitely agree with point 2. The Anki practice really shines when I combine it with my conversational practice. Memorizing the words alone doesn&#x27;t make me a better speaker, but it does mean there&#x27;s a lot fewer &quot;what&#x27;s the word?&quot; moments in the middle of a conversation.<p>I believe Anki memorization + regular conversational practice is second only to full immersion as the best learning strategy.

Blindly learning facts with no intent to synthesize them into something else will help you win at trivia contests. Learning to integrate those facts into something else (like conversation, with languages) is how you effectively learn. Both aspects are needed in order to become effective at whatever subject you&#x27;re studying.<p>That said, with Anki or any other tool these rules are incredibly handy:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;archives1990-2015&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20rules" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;archives1990-2015&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20ru...</a>

            When I first heard the term &quot;revising your notes&quot; I assumed it meant the kind of synthesis you speak of, or at least finding errors in lecture material. No, apparently it just means looking at them again, at least as a minimum.

            Hello! I made a few videos that explain how incremental Reading works:<p>1 Topics: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1ZNsn8IL-TM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1ZNsn8IL-TM</a>

As one might save their game state before and after a challenging section in a game, when you find a difficult to understand&#x2F;explain idea, incremental reading makes it easy to pause and synthesize that idea before moving on. Yes at the end also it’s good to summarize the ideas to yourself and simplify that explanation, and then use SuperMemo to memorize that explanation. Incremental reading is hard to explain why it is so useful, I’ve been using SuperMemo every day for 15 years and I still feel like I am learning new things

            Since the early 90s I&#x27;ve used a piano-practice scheme that provides spaced repetition. It greatly reduces the time needed to either (1) learn or (2) memorize pieces. I always feel compelled to cite this poem:<p>You can get a great deal from rehearsal<p>If it just has the proper dispersal<p>You would just be an ass<p>To do it en masse<p>Your remembering would turn out much

            Well, the first principle is not about spaced repetition but is more about active learning (wrong term?) vs. passive learning. In other words, don&#x27;t memorize by playing it a bunch and hoping repetition will beget recall. Instead, play from memory as far as you can (in sections as described below), filling in and approximating whatever you can&#x27;t remember exactly, but trying to recall parts in that section, even if you can&#x27;t piece them together in sequence.<p>The second principle is the spaced repetition. That works for learning the muscle memory as well as the memorization, but let&#x27;s just address memorization.<p>First I divide a piece into arbitrary sections, often pages but in information-dense music you&#x27;ve got to go a couple lines at a time. I do not usually divide at a sensible musical stopping point, because we remember the starts and ends of what we do much better than the middles. Choosing weird places to start and end helps get some of those middles into our heads; plus it&#x27;s really easy to mentally track what you&#x27;ve done if it&#x27;s at a page or line boundary.<p>Then, with sections A through, say, D, I&#x27;ll go in roughly this order, with &quot;A&quot; meaning I play all notes in section A in the proper sequence, even if I have to wait a few seconds sometimes to recall what happens next.<p>A A A; B B B A A; C C C B B A; D D D C C B A; D D C B; D C; D<p>...adjusting sometimes to accommodate the different information densities of the different sections. After this you&#x27;ll need some mental downtime because it sucks a lot out of you to recall so much. Later you can do sections E through H, etc.<p>By the time you&#x27;ve done that, you&#x27;re halfway to your goal. You can then start increasing the tempo toward performance quality by responsible metronome practice. I like to do<p>(1) the above routine out of tempo, waiting as long as necessary before notes<p>(2) the above routine at <i>any</i> tempo with metronome, doesn&#x27;t matter how ridiculously slow<p>(3) increasing the tempo gradually from there, not deviating from the &quot;note-perfect&quot; requirement

            really interesting stuff. I&#x27;m working on a tool that helps you play by ear by making you play back increasingly difficult melodies. Adding spaced repetition would probably make it a lot more efficient!

            Perhaps because of the AABBA rhyme scheme and the shorter third and fourth line.
But in a limerick the first line traditionally introduces a person and a place, which doesn’t happen here.

            The SuperMemo scheduling algorithm is a lot easier for me to deal with than Anki: if I miss a couple days, it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm me with a punishing review schedule.  With that, I really wish Woz would open source the SM18 algorithm, dealing with the SM UI is really painful.  I don&#x27;t love the Anki UI either, but it&#x27;s streets ahead of SM in that dimension.<p>Also, tangentially related: I really love Woz&#x27;s wiki, which is filled with interesting insights on learning: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru</a>

            Do you have some evidence that this particular algorithm is so effective?<p>I have some doubts that there is a &#x27;perfect&#x27; forgetting curve that maps over all items equally that this would matter to such a degree.<p>I.e. if it comes back after 3 days then 9 in Anki, or 2 days and 10 in SM18.<p>What matters is showing up and spending the time with your SR tool, as well as adding high quality cards.

            Just put in whatever time you have. Spaced repetition algorithms are robust against abuse. I have some spaced repetition items I&#x27;ve neglected for years, when I go back, the algorithms will do the appropriate thing and my time will still be used efficiently.

            I used Mnemosyne to memorize baby Rudin, Munkres’ Topology and large swaths of Dummit and Foote. Perfect scores on analysis and topology qualifying exams… good enough on algebra haha.<p>I had always been reluctant to use memorization but I found it helped immensely. Especially as a returning graduate student.

            Spaced repetition actually took off in recent years. But there&#x27;s another component of SuperMemo that didn&#x27;t, incremental reading: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Incremental_reading" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Incremental_reading</a><p>It seems a lot more effective than spaced repetition, but also a much higher level of commitment and a higher learning curve. It&#x27;s sort of like using a power tool. I haven&#x27;t tried it, but this is a good reminder that I should.

            The problem with this tool is you can&#x27;t review your extracts at the same time you are reviewing your flashcards.<p>For example, if you have a list of 50 PDFs and you want to incrementally read them, Polarized doesn&#x27;t have a way of scheduling when you&#x27;re going to read all 50 PDFs. Supermemo, you don&#x27;t have worry about that. IMO, that&#x27;s the key feature of Incremental Reading.<p>I can chuck dozens of articles at a time into Supermemo, and do not have to worry about forgetting to read them. They&#x27;ll show up in my reviews over time.

            Hello! I made a few videos that explain how incremental Reading works:
1 Topics: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1ZNsn8IL-TM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1ZNsn8IL-TM</a> 2 Incremental Reading core analogy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Wme2RLm1jWY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Wme2RLm1jWY</a> 3 How Incremental Reading makes micro learning easy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;piqq1kwYL5s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;piqq1kwYL5s</a>
Spoiler alert: basically incremental reading is like using save states when playing a game with an emulator. As one might save their game state before and after a challenging section in a game, when you find a difficult to understand&#x2F;explain idea, incremental reading makes it easy to pause and synthesize that idea before moving on. At the end also it’s good to summarize the ideas to yourself and simplify that explanation, and then use SuperMemo to memorize that explanation. Incremental reading is hard to explain why it is so useful, I’ve been using SuperMemo every day for 15 years and I still feel like I am learning new things

            I’ve been using SuperMemo for 15 years, in fact I just finished up my flashcards for today :) It definitely is useful but it isn’t the grand answer to all of life’s problems. It makes it very easy to remember stuff you want to remember but takes some training when it comes to how to structure desirable knowledge as a simple flashcard. Over the years I’ve rubber handed in how much I use SuperMemo, but the happy medium for me seems to be 1. I usually finish my flashcards first thing in the morning, 2. Get in the habit of “thinking with flashcards” by summarizing ideas into single sentences and 3. I keep an ongoing text document in my Notes app on my phone of information I find that is worth remembering. If SuperMemo had a robust mobile app that synced with the Windows program, it would be ideal. Using my Notes app seems to be the easiest alternative that I’ve found.

            It is a great algorithm. It is, however, a boring method and really takes a lot of discipline to make it a habit. For me, the best way to learn anything is have it tied to a fun challenge or a personal project. I&#x27;ve never been successful in the type of just-in-case learning.

            The most effective trick for me is simply knowing why I need to remember something.<p>If I don&#x27;t know its utility value, I won&#x27;t even be able to recall it an hour later. On the other hand, if I can see the utility, I might be able to remember it decades later after a single exposure.<p>If I&#x27;m using a map with GPS on my phone to find my way around a city, I won&#x27;t be able to recall any of the buildings or landmarks later and I won&#x27;t be able to find my way around even after many journeys. On the other hand, if I use street signs and ask around for directions, I will remember everything. In the former case, my brain knows that it can rely on the map and GPS so it doesn&#x27;t waste resources trying to remember streets, buildings and landmarks.

            I have similar &#x27;issues&#x27;. My wife tends to fuss over tiny details that seem completely irrelevant to me. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want to make an effort to comply with her more stringent expectations, it&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t even notice those details to begin with. It&#x27;s distracting to think about them. My mind is always trying to minimize its mental load by focusing only on things that it deems necessary. I guess it&#x27;s a more &#x27;entrepreneurial&#x27; mindset?<p>Most mathematicians seem to be able to remember anything regardless of utility value. I guess that&#x27;s why I chose a more engineering&#x2F;business career.

            I have noticed another learning dynamic and am curious to read other thoughts and experiences.<p>Often, I will read about something.  Say designing a PCB, or to play an instrument.  I will then watch a video, read, and or attempt the task just to get the lay of the land.<p>At that moment, if I really power through and reach a goal, the learning is useful.  I can retain and recall very reasonably.<p>However, say I attempt and do not reach a goal.  Maybe just exploring, or for lack of time.  If I remain interested, I will continue to read and or listen to audio, or video or talk to people about it.<p>On a future attempt not made too far in the future from last visit to the subject matter, many more things seem familiar!  My ability to navigate new skills and or recall rules, details is better than I would expect.  Sometimes I feel as if it is actually good to do that, let just a little time pass and then I will feel like I want to do it, and maybe that want is my mind having assembled new info seeks expression of it, a use.<p>Usually, I am overall more effective than I was on the initial attempt despite not being hands on.

            Sort of? It depends on the &quot;thing&quot;, but spaced repetition is pretty standard for physical activities like martial arts. In essence, you&#x27;re attending a class that focuses on drilling a particular technique on a regular interval. There isn&#x27;t much research from sports pedagogy, though I think its more because its just a &quot;known&quot; requirement that doesn&#x27;t require much new research. However, I would also say that spaced repetition goes beyond simply reviewing Anki flash cards and that there is an element of kinesthetic learning that is necessary to strengthen the learning gains.

            I am inclined to give his software a go.  Very interesting ideas that resonate with my own learning experiences.<p>This sales model is also interesting and notable:[1]<p>Older versions of SuperMemo are successively released as freeware.<p>By purchasing any of these freeware items you get registered in this store and become eligible to instantly upgrade to SuperMemo 17 (see Freeware Upgrade). In the future, you will also be able to upgrade to any SuperMemo at a big discount.<p>Your cheapest pathway to new SuperMemos is:
order SuperMemo 15 Freeware below (or any other collector item)
if you like SuperMemo 15, use Freeware Upgrade to get SuperMemo 17
in the future, keep upgrading to new versions of your choice (once registered in this store, you are perpetually eligible)<p>Well done!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;super-memo.com&#x2F;supermemo18.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;super-memo.com&#x2F;supermemo18.html</a>

            Does there exist an app&#x2F;website&#x2F;program that implements this technique for learning languages, combined with actual lesson plans?  I understand you can use the SuperMemo software or something like Anki to learn languages, but you need to decide what you want to learn and put it into the program.  What I&#x27;d like is something like Duolingo with an existing set of lessons and a progression, but that makes use of this reminder timing. (Duolingo does do reminders to practice old material, but it&#x27;s clearly not advanced.  It regularly has me practicing stuff that is far below my level and is effectively known forever.)

            The closest thing you&#x27;re probably going to find for languages is the Pimsleur method, which is also based on a specific formula of spaced repetition.  I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be for trying to achieve true conversational fluency, but I&#x27;ve found it very effective for quickly learning a basic set of words and phrases for a trip to another country.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pimsleur.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pimsleur.com&#x2F;</a>

            I&#x27;m making an app like this for Japanese, however it doesn&#x27;t have preset lessons yet. (I&#x27;m planning to add more structured lessons in the future.) For now what I have are a bunch of vocabulary lists for various shows&#x2F;novels&#x2F;etc. which you can pick and learn the vocabulary from, and then you can use the app to find the next show&#x2F;novel&#x2F;etc. where you&#x27;ll have to learn the least amount of new vocabulary to be able to consume it.

Again, should be enough to implement it yourself.<p>Other algorithms can be seen as variations on these themes. Like with Anki&#x27;s implementation (and I believe also SuperMemo&#x27;s) there is jitter added to the schedule so that too many cards don&#x27;t show up together over and over. This is to avoid the issue of remembering something because of what it&#x27;s with and not on its own. With language learning, say you enter a dozen cards on colors and review them all in one day, strictly speaking they could all end up recurring at the same time in the future. By adding jitter they get spread out so you can avoid accidental &quot;topic&quot; days and end up with a proper mix of cards for study.

            I put together a page that lets you try out different spaced repetition algorithms (with javascript code included), and you can try out your own algorithms as well: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ussherpress.com&#x2F;freshcards&#x2F;srs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ussherpress.com&#x2F;freshcards&#x2F;srs&#x2F;</a><p>There&#x27;s a link on the page to some info on how to use it as well, since it may not be obvious!

            I&#x27;ve used this npm package to implement spaced repetition review of bookmarked words in a dictionary app. It&#x27;s nicely put together and very readable.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;supermemo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;supermemo</a>

It keeps its state alongside your notes, and if you want to change your notes while doing a review session that&#x27;s seamless.

            Just look at an image search for &quot;spaced repetition&quot; and you can create it from the graphs you see.<p>Essentially you&#x27;re creating a set of reminders&#x2F;events with linear or exponential spacing between. A common pattern appears to be 1, 3, and 6 days after first learning, which is also 1, 2, and 3 days apart from each other.
