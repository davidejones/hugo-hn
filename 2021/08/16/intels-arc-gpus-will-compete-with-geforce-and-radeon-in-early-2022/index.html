            As TFA rightly points out, unless something <i>drastically</i> changes in the next ~6mo, Intel is going to launch into the most favorable market situation we&#x27;ve seen in our lifetimes. Previously, the expectation is that they needed to introduce something that was competitive with the top end cards from nVidia and AMD. With basically all GPU&#x27;s out of stock currently they really just need to introduce something competitive with the almost <i>anything</i> on the market to be able to sell as much as they can ship.

            Yup; three other points I&#x27;d add:<p>1) I hate to say &quot;year of desktop Linux&quot; like every year, but with the Steam Deck release later this year, and Valve&#x27;s commitment to continue investing and collaborating on Proton to ensure wide-range game support; Linux gaming is going to grow substantially throughout 2022, if only due to the new devices added by Steam Decks.<p>Intel has always had fantastic Linux video driver support. If Arc is competitive with the lowest end current-gen Nvidia&#x2F;AMD cards (3060?), Linux gamers will love it. And, when thinking about Steam Deck 2 in 2022-2023, Intel becomes an option.<p>2) The current-gen Nvidia&#x2F;AMD cards are <i>insane</i>. They&#x27;re unbelievably powerful. But, here&#x27;s the kicker: Steam Deck is 720p. You go out and buy a brand new Razer&#x2F;Alienware&#x2F;whatever gaming laptop, the most common resolution even on the high end models is 1080p (w&#x2F; high refresh rate). The Steam Hardware survey puts 1080p as the most common resolution, and ITS NOT EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE to #2 [1] (720p 8%, 1080p 67%, 1440p 8%, 4k 2%) (did you know more people use Steam on MacOS than on a 4k monitor? lol)<p>These Nvidia&#x2F;AMD cards are unprecedented overkill for most gamers. People are begging for cards that can run games at 1080p, Nvidia went straight to 4K, even showing off 8K gaming on the 3090, and now they can&#x27;t even deliver any cards that run 720p&#x2F;1080p. Today, we&#x27;ve got AMD releasing the 6600XT, advertising it as a beast for 1080p gaming [2]. This is what people actually want; affordable and accessible cards to play games on (whether they can keep the 6600xt in stock remains to be seen, of course). Nvidia went straight Icarus with Ampere; they shot for the sun, and couldn&#x27;t deliver.<p>3) More broadly, geopolitical pressure in east asia, and specifically taiwan, should be concerning investors in any company that relies heavily on TSMC (AMD &amp; Apple being the two big ones). Intel may start by fabbing Arc there, but they uniquely have the capacity to bring that production to the west.<p>I am very, very long INTC.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;hwsurvey&#x2F;Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;hwsurvey&#x2F;Steam-Hardware-Softw...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;amd-unveils-the-radeon-rx-6600-xt-a-graphics-card-for-power-gaming-at-1080p" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;amd-unveils-the-radeon-rx-6600-xt...</a>

            Steam will hardly change the 1% status of GNU&#x2F;Linux desktop.<p>Many forget that most studios don&#x27;t bother to port their Android games to GNU&#x2F;Linux, which are mostly written using the NDK, so plain ISO C and C++, GL, Vulkan, OpenSL,..., yet no GNU&#x2F;Linux, because the market just isn&#x27;t there.

            The first wave of Steam Decks sold out in minutes. They&#x27;re now pushing back delivery to Q2 2022. The demand for the device is pretty significant; not New Console large, but its definitely big enough to be visible in the Steam Hardware Survey upon release later this year, despite the vast size of Steam&#x27;s overall playerbase.<p>Two weeks ago, the Hardware Survey reported Linux breaching 1% for the first time ever [1], for reasons not related to Deck (in fact, its not obvious WHY linux has been growing; disappointment in the Win11 announcement may have caused it, but in short, its healthy, natural, long-term growth). I would put real money up that Linux will hit 2% by the January 2022 survey, and 5% by January 2023.<p>Proton short-circuits the porting argument. It works fantastically for most games, with zero effort from the devs.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about Linux being the majority. But its definitely looking like it will see growth over the next decade.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomshardware.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;steam-survey-linux-1-percent-steam-deck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomshardware.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;steam-survey-linux-1-perce...</a>

            It took 20 years to reach 1%, so...<p>I believed in it back in the Loki golden days, nowadays I rather bet on macOS, Windows, mobile OSes and game consoles.<p>It remains to be seen how the Steam fairs versus the Steam Machines of yore.

            Don&#x27;t let history blind you to the now ;)<p>It&#x27;s way better now than it was back then. There was a long period of good ports, which combined with the Steam for Linux client made Linux gaming a real thing already. But instead of fizzling out like the last time there were ports, now Linux transitioned to &quot;Run every game&quot; without needing a port. Some exceptions, but they are working on it and compatibility is huge.<p>This will grow slowly but steadily now, and is ready to explode if Microsoft does on bad move (like crazy Windows 11 hardware requirements, but we&#x27;ll see).<p>Biggest danger to that development are the gpu prices, the Intel gpus can only help there. A competent 200 bucks model is desperately needed to keep the PC as a gaming platform alive. It has to run on fumes - on old hardware - now.

            Vista brought a lot of migration to Linux indeed. And the Mac being incapable of playing games is a factor for quite some people. But until recently, gaming on Linux was limited.<p>No one said everyone though.

            What&#x27;s the rate of increase though? Has it been linear, 0.05% per year? No: it has increased about 0.25% since 2019. It&#x27;s not just that Linux is increasing, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s <i>rate of increase</i> is also increasing.

            How is it wishful thinking? It&#x27;s a proportional increase. Meaning that it has increased in both absolute and relative terms, and done so at a faster rate in the last two years. I&#x27;m stating an observation of the data. I don&#x27;t see room for wishful thinking in that.<p>Other platforms can increase while Linux also increases, the two aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s going to take over the market. It&#x27;s a huge long shot it will ever really rival Windows. Even if makes significant headway on Steam, that also doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate to a corresponding change in OS market share. But the pending arrival of the Steam Deck combined with an enormous increase in game compatibility has nonetheless set the stage for significant gains for Linux with Steam.<p>Which part of the above observations are wishful thinking?

            Not disagreeing with your overall point, but it&#x27;s pretty rare for people to port their mobile game to PC even if using Unity and all you have to do is figure out the controls. Which you&#x27;ve probably got a beta version of just to develop the game.

            I think talking about <i>android games</i> is moving the goalposts a bit. There&#x27;s no market for Android games on windows either.<p>On my end, and my Year of Linux Desktop started almost a decade ago, the Linux experience has not only never been better (of course) but has improved faster in recent years than ever before, and gaming is one of the fastest improving areas.<p>Proton is a fantastic piece of software.

            … Nvidia <i>did</i> release lower end cards that target the same market and price point as the 6600 XT a lot <i>earlier</i> than AMD though - as far as MSRP goes the 3060 and 3060 Ti bracket the 6600 XT’s $380 at $329 and $399 (not that MSRP means a thing right now) and similarly brackets performance, and even the MSRP was not received well in conjunction with the 1080p marketing.  <i>Both</i> manufacturers have basically told the mid and low range market to buy a console even if you are lucky enough to get an AMD reference or Nvidia FE card.

            I&#x27;ve happily taken their advice and have moved to an Xbox Series S for a good 80% of my gaming needs. What gaming I still do on my PC consists mainly of older games, emulators and strategy games. Although I&#x27;ve been messing with Retroarch&#x2F;Duckstation on my Xbox, and it&#x27;s been quite novel and fun to be playing PS1 games on a Microsoft console.

            Same here, I was looking to buy a GPU and for half the cost of a decent one (current market prices) I instead bought an Xbox Series X and a gamepass subscription. My gaming needs have been covered since February and gamepass keeps delivering while gpu prices are still too high for a no very serious gamer like myself.

Oh, and I couldn&#x27;t resist Splinter Cell (the original Xbox version) and Beyond Good and Evil, which are also discounted to like 4 Euros. I might just end up buying the whole Splinter Cell series.<p>Otherwise, I have a list of 100 games installed that I&#x27;m slowly playing through that Game Pass has given me access to.

            Intel sells expensive CPUs which are becoming useless thanks to ARM - as much in consumer devices as they are in datacenters, with big players designing their own ARM chips.  GPUs are their lifeboat. Three GPU players is better than two, but I don&#x27;t see much of a reason to be long Intel.

            I don&#x27;t believe much of anythign Apple tells me.  The x86 is fine, but any reasons to prefer it to other architectures are disappearing fast.  As someone who&#x27;s suffered (literally suffered) due to Intel&#x27;s abysmal and execrable graphics performance in the past, I don&#x27;t expect that they&#x27;ll exactly blow out this market.<p>One of the biggest reasons I want a <i>real</i> next-gen ARM-based Surface Pro is that I want to put Intel in the rearview mirror forever.  I didn&#x27;t hate Intel until I started buying Surfaces, then I realized that <i>everything</i> that sucks about the Surface family is 100% Intel&#x27;s fault, from beyond-buggy faulty power management (cutting advertised battery life more than in half) to buggy and broken graphics (&quot;Intel droppings&quot; or redraw artifacts on the screen) to &quot;integrated&quot; graphics performance that just simply sucks so bad it&#x27;s unusable for simple 3D CAD, much less gaming.

            &gt; These Nvidia&#x2F;AMD cards are unprecedented overkill for most gamers. People are begging for cards that can run games at 1080p, Nvidia went straight to 4K, even showing off 8K gaming on the 3090, and now they can&#x27;t even deliver any cards that run 720p&#x2F;1080p. Today, we&#x27;ve got AMD releasing the 6600XT, advertising it as a beast for 1080p gaming [2]. This is what people actually want; affordable and accessible cards to play games on (whether they can keep the 6600xt in stock remains to be seen, of course). Nvidia went straight Icarus with Ampere; they shot for the sun, and couldn&#x27;t deliver.<p>Do they need dedicated GPUs at all then? My impression has been that if you just want to go at 1080p and modest settings modern integrated GPUs can do fine for most games.

            It depends on the game; for something like CS:GO or Overwatch, an integrated GPU @ 1080p is fine. For something like Cyberpunk, Apex Legends, or Call of Duty, its really not enough for an enjoyable experience.

            There are also more reasons to buy nvidia gpus just than their speed they have great driver support, features like RTX Voice which cleans up the audio and other proprietary features like DLSS.

            I don&#x27;t own any INTC, just index funds right now, but I tip my hat to you on Intel. Buying Intel today is essentially like gobbling up American apple pie. If you love China, buy paper design firms AMD or Apple. If you like the USA, buy Intel or maybe a paperweight in Nvidia, as they&#x27;re diversified at Samsung and in talks to produce at Intel.<p>I&#x27;m expecting China-Taiwan-US tensions to increase, and all these outsourcing profit seeking traitors will finally eat crow. As if &quot;just getting rich&quot; wasn&#x27;t enough for them.<p>My stock bets and opinions don&#x27;t have to necessarily be pro-American (certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy anything outright anti-American). But I love it when they align like today.<p>Looking forward to picking up an Intel Arc.

            That depends on how much of TSMC&#x27;s capacity they&#x27;ve reserved, and which node they are manufacturing on. I&#x27;m guessing that a low end GPU doesn&#x27;t need a 5nm node. I think these are 7nm, which is still going to be booked tightly but probably not as heavily bottlenecked as smaller nodes.

            Independent of the question around TSMC they are still affected as:<p>- Shortages and price hikes caused by various effect are not limit to the GPU chiplet but also most other parts on the GPU.<p>- Especially it also affects the RAM they are using, which can be a big deal wrt. pricing and availability.

            The &#x27;+&#x27; in this case is a common process node trope where improvements to a node over time that involve rules changes become Node+, Node++, Node+++, etc.  So this is a node that started as Samsung 10nm, but they made enough changes to it that they started marketing it as 8nm.  When they started talking about it, it wasn&#x27;t clear if it was a more manufacturable 7nm or instead a 10nm with lots of improvements, so I drop the 10nm++++ to help give some context.

            Did you bother trying to do any research or comparison between TSMC&#x27;s 7nm &amp; Samsung&#x27;s 8nm or did you just want to make the claim that numbers are just marketing? Despite the fact that numbers alone were not being talked about, but two specific fab processes, and thus the &quot;it&#x27;s just a number!&quot; mistake wasn&#x27;t obviously being made in the first place?<p>But Nvidia has Ampere on both TSMC 7nm (GA100) and Samsung&#x27;s 8nm (GA102). The TSMC variant has a significantly higher density at 65.6M &#x2F; mm² vs. 45.1M &#x2F; mm². Comparing across architectures is murkey, but we also know that the TSMC 7nm 6900XT clocks a lot higher than the Samsung 8nm RTX 3080&#x2F;3090 while also drawing less power. There&#x27;s of course a lot more to clock speeds &amp; power draw in an actual product than the raw fab transistor performance, but it&#x27;s still a data point.<p>So there&#x27;s both density &amp; performance evidence to suggest TSMC&#x27;s 7nm is meaningfully better than Samsung&#x27;s 8nm.<p>Even going off of marketing names, Samsung has a 7nm as well and they don&#x27;t pretend their 8nm is just one-worse than the 7nm. The 8nm is an evolution of the 10nm node while the 7nm is itself a new node. According to Samsung&#x27;s marketing flowcharts, anyway. And analysis suggests Samsung&#x27;s 7nm is competitive with TSMC&#x27;s 7nm.

            I didn&#x27;t say NVIDIA did directly price cards?  Doesn&#x27;t sound like you are doing a very good job of following the HN rule - always give the most gracious possible reading of a comment.  Nothing I said directly implied that they did, you just wanted to pick a bone.  It&#x27;s really quite rude to put words in people&#x27;s mouths, and that&#x27;s why we have this rule.<p>But a 6900XT is available for $3100 at my local store... and the 3090 is $2100.  Between the two it&#x27;s not hard to see why the NVIDIA cards are selling and the AMD cards are sitting on the shelves, the AMD cards are 50% more expensive for the same performance.<p>As for <i>why</i> that is - which is the point I think you wanted to address, and decided to try and impute into my comment - who knows.  Price are &quot;sticky&quot; (retailers don&#x27;t want to mark down prices and take a loss) and AMD moves fewer cards in general.  Maybe that means that prices are &quot;stickier for longer&quot; with AMD.  Or maybe it&#x27;s another thing like Vega where AMD set the MSRP so low that partners can&#x27;t actually build and sell a card for a profit at competitive prices.  But in general, regardless of why - the prices for AMD cards are generally higher, and when they go down the AMD cards sell out too.  The inventory that is available is available because it&#x27;s overpriced.<p>(and for both brands, the pre-tariff MSRPs are essentially a fiction at this point apart from the reference cards and will probably never be met again.)

            &gt; But a 6900XT is available for $3100 at my local store... and the 3090 is $2100.<p>That&#x27;s just your store being dumb, then. The 6900 XT is averaging about $1,500 brand new on eBay[0] while the 3090 is going for about $2,500[1]. Even on Newegg, the cheapest in-stock 6900 XT card is $1,700[2] while the cheapest 3090 is $3,000[3]. Everything I&#x27;ve read suggests that the AMD cards, while generally a little slower than their Nvidia counterparts (especially when you factor in ray-tracing), give you way more bang for your buck.<p>&gt; the prices for AMD cards are generally higher<p>This is just not true. There may be several reasons for the Nvidia cards being out of stock more often than AMD: better performance; stronger brand; lower production counts; poor perception of AMD drivers; specific games being optimized for Nvidia; or pretty much anything else. But at this point, pricing is set by supply and demand, not by arbitrary MSRPs set by Nvidia&#x2F;AMD, so claiming that AMD cards are priced too high is absolutely incorrect.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw=6900xt&amp;_sacat=0&amp;LH_ItemCondition=1000&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;LH_Complete=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw=6900xt&amp;_sacat...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw=3090&amp;_sacat=0&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_ItemCondition=1000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw=3090&amp;_sacat=0...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newegg.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;pl?N=100007709%20601359957&amp;Order=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newegg.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;pl?N=100007709%20601359957&amp;Order=1</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newegg.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;pl?N=100007709%20601357248&amp;Order=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newegg.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;pl?N=100007709%20601357248&amp;Order=1</a>

            This is a problem for AMD especially, but also Nvidia. Not so much for Intel. They&#x27;re just budging in line with their superior firepower.

            &gt;TSMC is also not stupid. It&#x27;s better for them for their customers to compete<p>It depends how much money is involved. I don&#x27;t think TSMC, nor any business is the master chess player you&#x27;re envisioning, losing billions to instead worry about AMD&#x27;s woes. But rather consider AMD&#x27;s troubles as something they&#x27;ll have to sort out on their own in due time. They&#x27;re on their own.<p>Now, AMD and TSMC do have a good relationship. But large infusions of wealth corrupt even the most stalwart companions. This is one of those things that people don&#x27;t need to debate, we&#x27;ll see the results on 3nm. At a minimum, it looks like Intel is going to push AMD out of TSMC&#x27;s leading nodes. There&#x27;s no way to size this up as good news for AMD.<p>&gt;If Intel uses TSMC&#x27;s fabs, TSMC makes money and uses the money to improve TSMC&#x27;s process which AMD does use.<p>TSMC is going to make money without Intel anyway. Choking AMD may not be their intention, but it&#x27;s certainly a guaranteed side effect of it. Intel makes so much product that they are capable of using up their own space, and others. And now the GPUs are coming. Intel makes 10-times the profit AMD does per year. If AMD didn&#x27;t have an x86 license, no one would utter these two companies names in the same sentence.

            I expect AMD to start using N3 after Apple and Intel have moved on to N2 (or maybe 20A in Intel&#x27;s case) in 2024 so there&#x27;s less competition for wafers.

            Exactly. There are plenty of people that just want to upgrade an old GPU and anything modern would be a massive improvement.<p>I&#x27;m still rocking a 1070 for 1080p&#x2F;60 gaming and would love to jump to 4K&#x2F;60 gaming but just can&#x27;t convince myself to buy a new GPU at current prices.

            I refuse to engage with the current GPU pricing insanity, so my 5900x is currently paired with a 960 GTX.  When Intel enters the market it will be another factor in driving pricing back down, so might play Cyberpunk in 2022...

            If you really want to play Cyberpunk on PC, and don&#x27;t want to buy a new GPU.. playing it on Stadia is an option (especially if you have a GPU that can support VP9 decoding). I played it at 4K&#x2F;1080p, and it looked pretty good. However, I think if you want the best graphics fidelity (i.e. 4K RayTracing), then you probably do want to just get a high end video card.<p>Disclosure: Work at Google, but not on Stadia.

            That&#x27;s not quite true. The Arc was originally known as the DG2 and is the successor to the DG1. So to say it isn&#x27;t &quot;remotely related&quot; is a bit misleading, especially since we have very little information on the architecture.

            For some comparison, that&#x27;s a 30W 80EU part using 70GB&#x2F;s memory. DG2 is supposed to be 512EU part with over 400GB&#x2F;s memory. GPUs generally scale pretty well with EU count and memory bandwidth. Plus it has a different architecture which may be even more capable per EU.

            Just to add on that, DG1 was comparable to integrated graphics, but just in a discrete form factor. It was a tiny bit better because of higher frequency, I think. But even then it wasn&#x27;t better in all cases, if I recall correctly.

            To be more specific, Intel currently allocates a fair chunk of their dies to iGPUs. Will that no longer be the case when Intel manufacturers their own dedicated GPUs? It seems like a waste of silicon.

            Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve noticed prices falling on the lower end. My aging RX 580 was worth over $400 used at the beginning of the year; it now goes for ~$300. The 5700 XT was going for close to $1k used, and is more recently selling for $800-900.<p>With that said, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a sign of the shortage coming to an end; I think the release of the Ryzen 5700G with integrated graphics likely helped bridge the gap for people who wanted low-end graphics without paying the crazy markups.

            I remember RX 580s going for 170 Euros before the pandemic. I can only hope that prices reach sane levels sooner than later, but I suspect we&#x27;re going to see at least another year of outlandish prices.

            They also seem to be the most willing to open up their GPU sharding API, GVTG, based on their work with their existing Xe GPUs. The performance of their implementation in their first generation was a bit underwhelming, but it seems like the intention is there.<p>If Intel is able to put out something reasonably competitive and that supports GPU sharding it could be a game changer. It could change the direction of the ecosystem and force Nvidia and AMD to bring sharding to their consumer tier cards. I am stoked to see where this new release takes us.<p>Level1Linux has a (reasonably) up to date state of the GPU ecosystem that does a much better job outlining the potential of this tech.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IXUS1W7Ifys" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IXUS1W7Ifys</a>

            This is the main reason I&#x27;m excited about this. I really hope they continue the very open approach they&#x27;ve used so far, but even if they start going binary blob for some of it like nvidia and (now to a lesser extent) amd have at least they&#x27;re likely to properly implement KMS and other things because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve been doing already.

            That is just part of the story.<p>CUDA wiped out OpenCL, because it went polyglot as of version 3.0, while insisting that everyone should write in a C dialect.<p>They also provide great graphical debugging tools and libraries.<p>Khronos waited too long to introduce SPIR, and in traditional Khronos fashion, waited for the partners to provide the tooling.<p>One could blame NVidia, but it isn&#x27;t as the competition has done a better job.

            &gt;  ROCm supports Vega, Vega 7nm, and CDNA just fine.<p>yeah, but that&#x27;s exactly what OP said - Vega is three generations old at this point, and that is the last consumer GPU (apart from VII which is a rebranded compute card) that ROCm supports.<p>On the NVIDIA side, you can run at least basic tensorflow&#x2F;pytorch&#x2F;etc on a consumer GPU, and that option is not available on the AMD side, you have to spend $5k to get a GPU that their software actually supports.<p>Not only that but on the AMD side it&#x27;s a completely standalone compute card - none of the supported compute cards do graphics anymore.

            I really don&#x27;t think people appreciate the fact enough that for developers to care to learn about building software for your platform, you need to make it accessible for them to run that software. That means &quot;run on the hardware they will already have&quot;. AMD really need to push to get ROCm compiling for RDNA based chips.

            I&#x27;ve mentioned this on other forums, but it would help to have some kind of easily visible, public tracker for this progress. Even a text file, set of GitHub issues or project board would do.<p>Why? Because as-is, most people still believe support for gfx1000 cards is non-existent in any ROCm library. Of course that&#x27;s not the case as you&#x27;ve pointed out here, but without any good sign of forward progress, your average user is going to assume close to zero support.

            AMD&#x27;s MI100 has those 4x4 BFloat16 and FP16 matrix multiplication instructions you want, with PyTorch and TensorFlow compiling down into them through ROCm.<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong: $9000 is a lot for a development system to try out the software. NVidia&#x27;s advantage is that you can test out the A100 by writing software for cheaper GeForce cards at first.<p>NVidia also makes it easy with the DGX computer to quickly get a big A100-based computer. AMD you gotta shop around with Dell vs Supermicro (etc. etc.) to find someone to build you that computer.

            That makes a lot more sense, thanks. They could do with making that a lot clearer on the project.<p>Still handicaps them compared to Nvidia where you can just buy anything recent and expect it to work.

            NVidia can support anything because they have a PTX-translation layer between cards, and invest heavily on PTX.<p>Each assembly language from each generation of cards changes. PTX recompiles the &quot;pseudo-assembly&quot; instructions into the new assembly code each generation.<p>---------<p>AMD has no such technology. When AMD&#x27;s assembly language changes (ex: from Vega into RDNA), its a big compiler change. AMD managed to keep the ISA mostly compatible from 7xxx GCN 1.0 series in the late 00s all the way to Vega 7nm in the late 10s... but RDNA&#x27;s ISA change was pretty massive.<p>I think its only natural that RDNA was going to have compiler issues.<p>---------<p>AMD focused on Vulkan &#x2F; DirectX support for its RDNA cards, while its compute team focused on continuing &quot;CDNA&quot; (which won large supercomputer contracts). So that&#x27;s just how the business ended up.

            I bought an ATI card for deep learning. I&#x27;m a big fan of open source. Less than 12 months later, ROCm dropped support.

That&#x27;s MI25, MI50, or MI100.<p>&gt; As a footnote, I suspect in the long term, small purchases will be worth more than the supercomputing megacontracts. GPGPU is wildly underutilized right now. That&#x27;s mostly a gap of software, standards, and support. If we can get that right, every computer have many teraflops of computing power, even for stupid video chat filters and whatnot.<p>I think you&#x27;re right, but the #1 use of these devices is running video games (aka: DirectX and Vulkan). Compute capabilities are quite secondary at the moment.

My dev desktop would like a working GPU 24&#x2F;7, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be nearly that big.<p>If I had my druthers, I would have bought an NVidia 3050, since it has adequate compute, and will run once available &lt;$300. Of course, anything from the NVidia consumer line is impossible to buy right now, except at scalper prices.<p>I just did a web search. The only card from that series I can find for sale, new, was the MI100, which runs $13k. The MI50 doesn&#x27;t exist, and the MI25 can only be bought used on eBay. Corporate won&#x27;t do eBay. Even the MI100 would require an exception, since it&#x27;s an unauthorized vendor (Amazon doesn&#x27;t have it).<p>Combine that with poor software support, and an unknown EOL, and it&#x27;s a pretty bad deal.<p>&gt; I think you&#x27;re right, but the #1 use of these devices is running video games (aka: DirectX and Vulkan). Compute capabilities are quite secondary at the moment.<p>Companies should maximize shareholder value. Right now:<p>- NVidia is building an insurmountable moat. I already bought an NVidia card, and our software already has CUDA dependencies. I started with ROCm. I dropped it. I&#x27;m building developer tools, and if they pick up, they&#x27;ll carry a lot of people.<p>- It will be years before I&#x27;m interested in trying ROCm again. I was oversold, and AMD underdelivered.<p>- Broad adoption is limited by lack of standards and mature software.<p>It&#x27;s fine to day compute capabilities are secondary right now, but I think that will limit AMD in the long term. And I think lack of standards is to NVidia&#x27;s advantage right now, but it will hinder long-term adoption.<p>If I were NVidia, I&#x27;d make:<p>- A reference CUDA open-source implementation which makes CUDA coda 100% compatible with Xe and Radeon<p>- License it under GPL with a CLA, so any Intel and AMD enhancements are open and flow back<p>- Have nominal optimizations in the open-source reference implementation, while keeping the high-performance proprietary optimizations NVidia proprietary (and only for NVidia GPUs)<p>This would encourage broad adoption of GPGPU, since any code I wrote would work on any customer machine, Intel, AMD, or NVidia. On the other hand, it would create an unlevel playing field for NVidia, since as the copyright holder, only NVidia could have proprietary optimizations. HPC would go to NVidia, as would markets like video editing or CAD.

            ROCm seems to be tolerably decent, if you are willing to spend a couple hours, and, big if, if HIP supports all the various libraries you were relying on. CUDA has a huge support library, and ROCm has been missing not just the small fry stuff but a lot of the core stuff in the that library.<p>Long term, AI (&amp; a lot of other interests) need to serve themselves. CUDA is excellently convenient, but long term I have a hard time imagining there being a worthwhile future for anything but Vulkan. There don&#x27;t seem to be a lot of forays into writing good all-encompassing libraries in Vulkan yet, nor many more specialized AI&#x2F;ML Vulkan libraries, so it feels largely like we more or less haven&#x27;t started really trying.

            is there any indication that ROCm has solved its stability issues?  I wasn&#x27;t doing the testing myself, but the reason why we rejected ROCm a while back (2 years?) was because you could get segfaults hours into a ML training run, which is... frustrating, to say the least, and not easily identifiable in quickie test runs (or CI, if ML did more CI).

            &gt; Do you think AMD should solve every problem CUDA solves for their customers too?<p>They had no choice. Getting a bunch of HPC people to completely rewrite their code for a different API is a tough pill to swallow when you&#x27;re trying to win supercomputer contracts. Would they have preferred to spend development resources elsewhere? Probably, they&#x27;ve even got their own standards and SDKs from days past.<p>&gt; everyone else using GPU&#x27;s is running fast as they can towards Vulkan<p>I&#x27;m not qualified to comment on the entirety of it, but I can say that basically no claim in this statement is true:<p>1. Not everyone doing compute is using GPUs. Companies are increasingly designing and releasing their own custom hardware (TPUs, IPUs, NPUs, etc.)<p>2. Not everyone using GPUs is cares about Vulkan. Certainly many folks doing graphics stuff don&#x27;t, and DirectX is as healthy as ever. There have been bits and pieces of work around Vulkan compute for mobile ML model deployment, but it&#x27;s a tiny niche and doesn&#x27;t involve discrete GPUs at all.<p>&gt; Is it just too soon too early in the adoption curve<p>Yes. Vulkan compute is still missing many of the niceties of more developed compute APIs. Tooling is one big part of that: writing shaders using GLSL is a pretty big step down from using whatever language you were using before (C++, Fortran, Python, etc).<p>&gt; do ya&#x27;ll think there are more serious obstructions long term to building a more Vulkan centric AI&#x2F;ML toolkit<p>You could probably write a whole page about this, but TL;DR yes. It would take <i>at least</i> as much effort as AMD and Intel put into their respective compute stacks to get Vulkan ML anywhere near ready for prime time. You need to have inference, training, cross-device communication, headless GPU usage, reasonably wide compatibility, not garbage performance, framework integration, passable tooling and more.<p>Sure these are all feasible, but who has the incentive to put in the time to do it? The big 3 vendors have their supercomputer contracts already, so all they need to do is keep maintaining their 1st-party compute stacks. Interop also requires going through Khronos, which is its own political quagmire when it comes to standardization. Nvidia already managed to obstruct OpenCL into obscurity, why would they do anything different here? Downstream libraries have also poured untold millions into existing compute stacks, OR rely on the vendors to implement that functionality for them. This is before we even get into custom hardware like TPUs that don&#x27;t behave like a GPU at all.<p>So in short, there is little inevitable about this at all. The reason people may have been frustrated by your comment is because Vulkan compute comes up all the time as some silver bullet that will save us from the walled gardens of CUDA and co (especially for ML, arguably the most complex and expensive subdomain of them all). We&#x27;d all like it to come true, but until all of the aforementioned points are addressed this will remain primarily in pipe dream territory.

            The paradox I identify in your comments is the start &amp; where you end. The start is that AMD&#x27;s only choice is to re-embark &amp; re-do the years &amp; years of hard work, to catch up.<p>The end is decrying how impossible &amp; hard it is to imagine anyone ever reproducing anything like CUDA in Vulkan:<p>&gt; <i>Sure these are all feasible, but who has the incentive to put in the time to do it?</i><p>To talk to the first though: what choice do we have? Why would AMD try to compete by doing it all again as a second party? It seems like, with Nvidia so dominant, AMD and literally everyone else should realize their incentive is to compete, as a group, against the current unquestioned champion. There needs to be some common ground that the humble opposition can work from. And, from what I see, Vulkan is that ground, and nothing else is remotely competitive or interesting.<p>I really appreciate your challenges, thank you for writing them out. It is real hard, there are a lot of difficulties starting afresh, with a much harder to use toolkit than enriched spiced up C++ (CUDA) as a starting point. At the same time, I continue to think there will be a sea-change, it will happen enormously fast, &amp; it will take far less real work than the prevailing pessimist&#x27;s view could ever have begin to encompassed. Some good strategic wins to set the stage &amp; make some common use cases viable, good enough technics to set a mold, and I think the participatory nature will snowball, quickly, and we&#x27;ll wonder why we hadn&#x27;t begun years ago.

            Saying all the underdog competitors should team up is a nice idea, but as anyone who has seen how the standards sausage is made (or, indeed, has tried something similar) will tell you, it is often more difficult than everyone going their own way. It might be unintuitive, but coordination is <i>hard</i> even when you&#x27;re not jockeying for position with your collaborators. This is why I mentioned the silver bullet part: a surface level analysis leads one to believe collaboration is the optimal path, but that starts to show cracks real quickly once one starts actually digging into the details.<p>To end things on a somewhat brighter note, there will be no sea change unless people put in the time and effort to get stuff like Vulkan compute working. As-is, most ML people (somewhat rightfully) expect accelerator support to be handed to them on a silver platter. That&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;d argue by doing so we lose the right to complain about big libraries and hardware vendors doing what&#x27;s best for their own interests instead of for the ecosystem as a whole.

Between them the world supply of high end GDDR is monopolized.<p>Intel is going to deliver some badly needed competition.  They don&#x27;t even have to approach the top of the GPU high end; just deliver something that will play current games at 1080p at modest settings and they&#x27;ll have an instant hit.  Continuing the tradition of open source support Intel has had with (most) of their GPU technology is something else we can hope for.

            If they support virtualization like they do on their iGPUs that would be great and possibly drive adoption by power users. But I suspect they&#x27;ll use that feature for market segmentation just like AMD and Nvidia do.

            Edit: Okay I had it slightly wrong, rewritten.<p>Aurora was originally slated to use Phi chips, which are an unrelated architecture to these GPUs.

It&#x27;s more that they were halfway through making a supercomputer and then started over.<p>I could probably pin the biggest share of the blame on 10nm problems, which are irrelevant to this architecture.<p>As far as <i>this</i> architecture goes, when they announced Aurora was switching, they announced 2021.

            &gt; I could probably pin the biggest share of the blame on 10nm problems, which are irrelevant to this architecture.<p>I doubt that.<p>If Xeon Phi were a relevant platform, Intel could have easily kept it... continuing to invest into the platform and make it into 7nm like the rest of Aurora&#x27;s new design.<p>Instead, Intel chose to build a new platform from its iGPU architecture. So right there, Intel made a fundamental shift in the way they expected to build Aurora.<p>I don&#x27;t know what kind of internal meetings Intel had to choose its (mostly untested) iGPU platform over its more established Xeon Phi line, but that&#x27;s quite a dramatic change of heart.<p>------------<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m more inclined to believe in Intel&#x27;s decision (they know more about their market than I do), but its still a massive shift in architecture... with a huge investment into a new software ecosystem (DPC++, OpenMP, SYCL, etc. etc.), a lot of which is largely untested in practice (DPC++ is pretty new, all else considered).<p>--------<p>&gt; As far as this architecture goes, when they announced Aurora was switching, they announced 2021. That schedule, looking four years out for a new architecture, has only had one delay of an extra 6 months.<p>That&#x27;s fair. But the difference between Aurora-2018 vs Aurora-2021 is huge.

            Mostly unrelated, but I&#x27;m still amazed that if you bought Intel at the height of the Dot-com bubble and held on, you still wouldn&#x27;t have broken even, even ignoring inflation.

            It was sold as a serious gaming GPU.<p>Recall that this was an era where GPUs weren&#x27;t yet a thing; instead there was 2D video cards and 3D accelerators that paired with. The i740 and TNT paved the way toward GPUs, while I don&#x27;t recall whether either had programmable pipelines they both had 2D capacity. For budget gamers, it wasn&#x27;t a _terrible_ choice to purchase an i740 for the combined 2D&#x2F;3D ability.

            I definitely remember that era, I just don&#x27;t remember that having anything other than an entry-level label. It&#x27;s possible that this could have been due to the lackluster results — Wikipedia definitely supports the interpretation that the image changed in the months before it launched:<p>&gt; In the lead-up to the i740&#x27;s introduction, the press widely commented that it would drive all of the smaller vendors from the market. As the introduction approached, rumors of poor performance started circulating. … The i740 was released in February 1998, at $34.50 in large quantities.<p>However, this suggests that it was never going to be a top-end contender since it was engineered to hit a lower price point and was significantly under-specced compared to the competitors which were already on the market:<p>&gt; The i740 was clocked at 66Mhz and had 2-8MB of VRAM; significantly less than its competitors which had 8-32MB of VRAM, allowing the card to be sold at a low price. The small amount of VRAM meant that it was only used as a frame buffer, hence it used the AGP interface to access the system&#x27;s main memory to store textures; this was a fatal flaw that took away memory bandwidth and capacity from the CPU, reducing its performance, while also making the card slower since it had to go through the AGP interface to access the main memory which was slower than its VRAM.

            My recollection is that the switchover to referring to them as a &quot;GPU&quot; wasn&#x27;t integrating 2D and 3D in the same card, but the point where we offloaded MUCH more computation to the graphics card itself. So we&#x27;re talking specifically about when NVidia launched the Geforce 256 - a couple of generations after the TNT

            It&#x27;s kind of amazing to me that I never really encountered or read about the i740. I got <i>really</i> into PC gaming in 1997, we got internet that same year so I read a ton and was hyper aware of the various hardware that was released, regardless of whether I could actually own any of it (spoiler, as a ~11 year old, no I could not). How did this sneak by me?

            Interesting, but the add-in-card GPU market <i>for graphics purposes</i> is so small, it&#x27;s hard to get worked up about it. The overwhelming majority of GPU units sold are IGPs. Intel owns virtually 100% of the computer (excluding mobile) IGP market and 70% of the total GPU market. You can get almost the performance of Intel&#x27;s discrete GPUs with their latest IGPs in &quot;Tiger Lake&quot; generation parts. Intel can afford to nibble at the edges of the discrete GPU market because it costs them almost nothing to put a product out there and to a large extent they won the war already.

            I would guess that the main point has to be hardware accelerated features, such as ray-tracing. I agree though that it seems pointless to buy a budget GPU when it’s basically a scaled up iGPU. Perhaps it makes sense if you want a mid-range CPU without a iGPU and you can’t operate it headlessly, or if you have an old PC that needs a mild refresh.
