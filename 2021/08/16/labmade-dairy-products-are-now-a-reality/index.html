            I have been involved with plant-based cheese making for the last year or so, and here&#x27;s my opinion:<p>This is interesting research, but lab-made cheese is far away from being in the shelves. Producing casein with yeast is one thing, but that doesn&#x27;t mean  you can just make cheese out of it. In cow or goat milk (or sheep milk), there are 4 different casein proteins arranged in micelles together with other molecules. That exact set up is important, because when you add rennet (i.e. mostly the enzyme chymosin) to it for coagulation, it cuts the kappa caseins (which are on the outside of the micelles) at a specific position. That&#x27;s key to the process that is set in motion after that, leading to the texture, taste and function we know from different cheeses.<p>Other challenges include the mass production of casein in this way. Cheeses contain typcially between 10-15% protein per weight, so you need to produce a lot of it. This is unlike e.g., Impossible Foods, which also produce heme with yeast, but of course they need much less of it per kg of meat.<p>We&#x27;re looking at ways of directly make cheese from plant proteins by finding an enzyme that works similarly how chymosin works with casein. It&#x27;s not clear if this will work - but if does, it will be a cheaper and simpler process than trying to produce milk synthetically.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that I dismiss the synthetic casein approach - I think it can work, it&#x27;s just important to understand that it&#x27;s not as simple it sounds. In the future, we might see cheeses made with both approaches, maybe each with their pros and cons.

            It seems like you would want to build a high surface area framework&#x2F;scaffold of the 3-5 dependent layers above the actual production of milk. One semi important question is how do you determine which genome to use. Each cow for instance produces genetically different milk which is based on its genome and epigenome. My guess is we can probably get to a near product pretty quickly with known tech and the next century will be consumed with making adjustments as more is uncovered about the role played by systems not included in the model. Eventually you will likely end up with a basic model of every system in the cow to achieve actual milk.<p>It is curious how so much bio technological&#x2F;financial effort is spent on something that not only does not contribute to the extension of human life but also serves no other purpose than it’s own end. In general milk is more of a cultural commodity than an anything close to a necessity.<p>Personally I would much rather biotech focused efforts on life saving&#x2F;extending tech and then we can address other desires later like more perfect hairlines, longer orgasms and memories ect, but such is the conundrum of capitalism trying to determine which humanitarian goal to solve.

            What do you mean, food not being lifesaving?<p>Unless there&#x27;s a plan to wean off all industries off cow milk, we&#x27;ll need it to vastly reduce environmental impact.

            The article and the parent comment are about producing milk that is <i>identical</i> to cow milk in a bioreactor instead of in a cow&#x27;s udder. It&#x27;s not about milk alternatives or cheese from plant sources like cashew.<p>Just like there are companies working on lab-grown meat vs. meat-like products (e.g. Impossible, Beyond, Planted).

            I can&#x27;t access the article, but I&#x27;ll mention something else. One year ago I met a guy who was working with trying to make bacteria produce caseine and whey. He had some experience making cheese and said that the proteins found in milk are really the secret behind making cheese taste and feel like cheese.<p>The goal was to just have bacteria, feed them molasses (which is cheap and easy to come by) and get raw milk protein as a result. Much more efficient than actually going through a cow.<p>&quot;I would love to say that products in stores is only 2 years away, but let&#x27;s say 5 to be on the safe side&quot;.<p>Milk is substitutable. You loose the taste for it in a year or so. Cheese? I have tried many vegan cheeses. They all suck.

            &gt; Milk is substitutable. You loose the taste for it in a year or so. Cheese? I have tried many vegan cheeses. They all suck.<p>I think there&#x27;s also a marketing issue with these things. This reminds of two anecdotes.<p>A few months ago, I got curious and tried one of those &quot;alternative milks&quot;. As &quot;milk&quot;, they all tasted terribly. Some tried to mimic the taste more than others. Some had tons of seed oils, which, I&#x27;ve heard, aren&#x27;t all that great for the body. But one of these, I actually liked. It didn&#x27;t really taste like milk, and it had next to nothing aside from oats and water.<p>A few years ago, I was out at a bar in Paris and caught a discussion between three people, one French, one Italian and one Wisconsinite. The subject was the cheese brought from the US. And the part that stuck with me was along the lines of: &quot;This doesn&#x27;t taste like Parmigiano at all. &#x2F; But it&#x27;s still very, very good cheese. &#x2F; I think you&#x27;d have much more success selling it as its own name&quot;.<p>My point is that maybe instead of trying to recreate &quot;vegan steaks&quot; or &quot;vegan cheese&quot; or whatever, call it something new and let it stand on its own. It will probably never be the same as &quot;the real thing&quot;, and that&#x27;s OK. Even better if it can forego all those weird, highly processed ingredients needed to try to give it a semblance of texture, etc.

            I think it is good that they exist, because sometimes you want something that is similar to food you had growing up. A staple food when I grow up was milk-boiled macaroni with a special kind of sausage (falukorv) and ketchup. I have been able to make it for my kids, and I really like to present at least a small part of my culinary heritage. And sometimes I just want a friggin burger. Which I can get almost everywhere by now, and it is greasy and savoury in all the right ways.<p>But in general I do think there are great products out there already. In the last years in Sweden tempeh started becoming available, and more brands of tofu (especially smoked varieties) started showing up in the groceries.<p>People have been eating those for hundreds or thousands of years, and they are amazingly versatile products. I have come to the realization that I don&#x27;t need new products. I just need to discover the ones that are already available.

            Sounds good - something very like animal proteins without raising entire animals to produce them.<p>Beyond that though, I&#x27;m really interested in foods that could be created that <i>don&#x27;t</i> mimic existing foods derived from animals or plants. You could imagine a nutritionist defining requirements - combinations of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, various micronutrients. Now add the aesthetics of taste, texture, consistency etc. Some of these would be &quot;ready to eat,&quot; either hot or cold, but others could be raw materials for traditional cooking: shred a block of this solid stuff, fry it in that liquid oily stuff, and drizzle some thick spicy stuff on it. Marketers to invent names, of course. Maybe we even get food tailored to us individually, based on specific nutritional needs, fitness goals, religious restrictions or palate.<p>This doesn&#x27;t <i>sound</i> appetizing, so I think it would be a gradual process, where new products 
come out that aren&#x27;t <i>quite</i> like natural foods, but are still acceptably tasty, and cheaper or more nutritious. Gradually we get things that are quite different. It would take a while, but I suspect in a few hundred years we&#x27;ll have things that are unimaginable today but as accepted as cheese, beer or sausage. And with much, much lower impact on the biosphere.

Nothing from a Twinkie to cheese (one of the oldest processed foods) resembles anything that comes from animals or plants.<p>Humanity has been doing this for all of recorded history.<p>Often the processing came of necessity:  many of our culinary traditions are simply things that evolved such that we could preserve food pre-refrigeration.  The problem is that we still don&#x27;t seem to be very good at making healthy processed foods, and once you stray away from basic foods, there&#x27;s strong market pressures to optimize for taste (and, let&#x27;s be honest, borderline addictiveness) above nutrition.

            The work toward this kind of &#x27;ready to eat&#x27; food has already started, with companies selling things like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mealsquares.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mealsquares.com&#x2F;</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jimmyjoy.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jimmyjoy.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>The zeitgeist seems to be about going back to more natural food though, at least in my circles.<p>The underlying fear is that what is sold as &#x27;nutritionally complete&#x27; food is actually incomplete, but that we don&#x27;t know enough about nutrition yet to notice it : so the best strategy is to keep a tried and true diet, like a Mediterranean diet.

            Yeah, that is a completely well-founded fear and undoubtedly true in the short term. Living on nothing but meal squares or Soylent would be a bad idea. But I don&#x27;t imagine anyone would have to do that. Nor do I imagine that synthetic food would have to be nutritionally complete; it&#x27;d just be designed with a specific purpose rather than being the byproduct of some organism&#x27;s survival strategy.

            True. But we aren&#x27;t infant cows. We have different and more varied needs. So I guess I&#x27;m wondering what milk would be like if we designed it for weaned humans, in various circumstances.

            True that we aren&#x27;t infant cows, but we&#x27;re very close. There aren&#x27;t many nutrients that we need but they don&#x27;t, or vice versa (vitamin C is an exception) -- the bigger difference would be in relative amounts. You can live quite happily for a long, long time on a diet of bread and cow milk.

            I saw one commentator below mention quorn, but I think it depends on how this was done, presented and marketed.<p>Some top chefs do something approaching this - not quite at the molecular level in the way mentioned here, in a lab (although it&#x27;s called molecular gastronomy), but nevertheless experimenting with different combinations and techniques.  Artisanal experimentation vs industrial production.

            As someone who was brought up vegetarian but later ate meat occasionally, I personally prefer the taste and texture of Quorn pieces, mince and sausages. I’ve never tried the stuff that tries to more directly imitate meat though. More generally I find the rise of vegan foods that try to emulate the taste and texture of meat quite disappointing, but they’ve pushed good vegetarian food out of many menus.

            &gt; Lactose intolerance is rising in the US population<p>Isn&#x27;t it just the logical consequence of non-European immigration? AFAIK lactose intolerance is a pretty well-known phenomenon (unlike gluten): <i>mamals</i> are lactose intolerant after <i>weaning</i>, and as such most humans are so. There exist a few places (northern Europe, subsaharian Africa, southern? India, somewhere in the middle East) where the same kind of nonsense mutation on the gene responsible for weaning appeared, so people from there are usually lactose tolerant even after being weaned. The more people not coming from there there is in your population, the less lactose tolerant your population will be.<p>Edit: incorrect english wording

            In most cultures with a majority of lactose tolerant people, there&#x27;s a lot of lactose in everyday food, so people missing the mutation usually never complete their weaning before long in adulthood, when for some reason they “stop or drastically reduce [their] intake”.<p>Unless you know for sure that you have the mutation, stopping drinking milk or consuming dairies at some point in your life comes with a risk of not being able to drink milk ever again in your life.

            That sure isn&#x27;t how my lactose intolerance went. I stopped drinking milk as a child because it became unpleasant and as an adult have no trouble eating the many dairy products that don&#x27;t have a lot of lactose (cheese, yogurt, etc).

            <i>weaning</i> is what I meant. I didn&#x27;t know that word and because severing is really close to <i>sevrage</i> (the French word) and semantically close to it, I assumed it meant the same while writing and only realized it was incorrect when I checked after pressing the <i>reply</i> button.

            I&#x27;d also like to see those studies of yours. And I wonder if that accounts for lactase persistent people like me, and accounts for a more healthy population because the saturated fats of milk is probably more harmful to an already more overweight group.

            &quot;now this&quot; is a good thing that is happening. The dairy industry (mega farms) pollute like few others and with the way they treat animals it is good if that entire industry can be replaced by something else. The farming industry also receives billion upon billions in farm subsidies (at least in the EU). Money that can be saved when the farms has gone out of business.

            This should also impact the meat industry.

            Slight impact yes, but pushback not really. Modern dairy breeds are very different from meat breeds. Using dairy breed calves for consumption is a reaction to the problem of calf disposal but not a necessity of meat production.

            Buffalo in Yellowstone are not a useful reference point here.  I hunt animals across the US, and I can assure you that flies and mud is the LEAST of the problems wild animals have to deal with.<p>A particularly revolting example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdnsciencepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1139&#x2F;cjz-2018-0140#.W9tXqRNKgWo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdnsciencepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1139&#x2F;cjz-2018-0140#.W9tXqRN...</a><p>A study published in the Canadian Journal of Zoology in 2018 found that from 2014 to 2016, 70 percent of moose calves in west-central Maine and northern New Hampshire died of emaciation by winter tick infestation. On average, each animal hosted 47,371 ticks.

            newscientist used to be one of my favorite news outlets, and them going paywall would not bug me as much if just a few weeks before going paywall, they didn&#x27;t (justifiably) go on a rant how paywalls destroy science...

            Are they?<p>I can&#x27;t access the article behind the paywall, but I ultimately have a very simple question: Where can I (living in Germany, Europe) buy one of these milk alternatives that tastes like milk? Can you name a shop?<p>I would like to buy it. I&#x27;m willing to pay a premium. I feel this is an important enough development given the high greenhouse gas impact of milk that I&#x27;d like to be an early adopter.<p>It&#x27;s not the first time I read about something like this, but often enough if you look into some of these plant replacements it&#x27;s some startup saying &quot;we have fancy tech that allows us to create this product that really is like the original&quot;, but they only announce it, but haven&#x27;t gotten to the point to actually produce and sell it.

            I&#x27;m worried that there might be regulatory hurdles. The article says:<p>&gt; nobody has to convince regulators that the foods are fit for human consumption, because they are made using microorganisms and processes that are already “generally recognised as safe”.<p>But the only mention of the &quot;food industry&quot; is FDA, which is specific to the USA:<p>&gt; When Perfect Day asked the FDA to approve its whey protein in 2020, the agency said yes right away.

            But is a &quot;real milk alternative&quot; available in the US? Perfect Day seems to only sell ice cream. (I don&#x27;t eat a lot of ice cream, but from what I can tell vegan ice cream alternatives are already pretty good. It&#x27;s actual milk - and cheese - that are the challenge.)

            is it not easier to simply buy carbon offsets, if that&#x27;s your actual concern in the first place?<p>We will never replicate the real thing closely enough.

            I buy carbon offsets to try to blunt my impact but I&#x27;d also pay a premium for more sustainable milk (and more importantly cheese) that was harder to distinguish.<p>Carbon offsetting is a poor substitute for just not having a big carbon footprint to begin with. It&#x27;s a sticking plaster at best, and incredibly hard to verify the impact of as an individual consumer.
