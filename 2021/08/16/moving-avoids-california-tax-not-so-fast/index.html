            I know that we have a tendency on this site to oversimplify things, but if you read the list of things you have to do to demonstrate residency elsewhere, it really is quite simple. If you actually live elsewhere like a normal person and are only back in California occasionally for vacation, you&#x27;re at little risk of being audited and even less risk of being assessed taxes. The problem comes in when you try to have your cake and eat it. For example, you might run into trouble if you&#x27;re trying to work and live in Cali five months and thirty days a year without paying California taxes.<p>I know for me, as a relatively high income individual, the FTB did not even make a peep about our residency change. They didn&#x27;t even ask for any documentation, to the best of my recollection.

            I moved six years ago.  I got demand letters from the CA tax board for four years after I left. I didn&#x27;t owe them a dime but they still tried. Had to call and submit paperwork every time. At least the CA tax board people are super agreeable. It was annoying but less so because they were nice.

            My partner lived and worked in CA in the early 2000&#x27;s. Moved to NYC in 2004. Had zero ties to CA after that. Switched her driver&#x27;s license, voter registration, filed and paid taxes in NY, owned and operated a company in NY, had no CA bank accounts or investments, never set foot back in the state. CA still would regularly come after her about every other year and make her go through the same process of calling and sending them paperwork to convince them that she didn&#x27;t live there. Her bank accounts would get frozen for weeks at a time and she&#x27;s paid lawyers thousands of dollars to clear it up. That continued regularly until 2014, when we moved abroad and she closed her US bank accounts. CA probably <i>still</i> thinks she&#x27;s a resident but now there aren&#x27;t any bank accounts for them to go after.

            Do you know whether she filed the right partial-year CA tax filing for the year you moved?  It almost sounds like she missed a step that would &quot;close out&quot; the CA tax records...<p>My wife and I moved overseas around the same time, filing one CA non-resident&#x2F;partial year filing. In subsequent years, we only filed IRS returns with the foreign earned income exclusion, etc. and had no further issues.  It was the other, ongoing treasury department reporting requirements that were a pain, not taxes per se.  We eventually moved back and had another CA partial-year return to start things up again.<p>We even used a trusted relative&#x27;s CA address as our mailing address for federal tax filings and US financial accounts we kept open while abroad.  We did let our CA drivers licenses lapse while getting new ones overseas.

            LA did the same thing to me for 6 years. They put me into collections at some point, which somehow never showed up on my credit report (thankfully), but every single year they&#x27;d harass me about taxes, and I&#x27;d need to fax them documentation.

            RSU&#x27;s?  Exercised options? My understanding is that you would pay taxes on shares sold.  Shares not sold are not yet income.  Taxes get paid when RSU&#x27;s vest but that is usually done by your company on your behalf and the numbers will show up in your tax paperwork.   A potential wealth tax may side step that however.  Either way I let my tax lawyers figure all that out.

            This isn&#x27;t right. They are counted as income when they vest. They will appear on your W-2. When you sell them is not important for the purpose of income taxation.

            Yeah I think the phrasing threw me off.  There are taxes paid at the time of vesting of RSU&#x27;s (vs options) but that is usually done by your employer before you even see the stock in your stock management accounts.  The bigger and more ugly taxes come from selling off the stock.

            Depends on how long you wait to sell, and if what happens to the asset price in the mean time. I sell all my shares the day after they vest or the same day. I pay basically zero net taxes on that action.

            Not a tax expert but IIRC since they were earned in CA, they generally are taxed when they result in a net gain of some sort (e.g. sold directly or exercised).  Go to Section E of the FTB&#x27;s publication 1100.

            urgh maybe I should talk to a tax expert. The section discusses NSOs but I have ISOs. I also don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s impacted by the fact that the company I work for is based in Boston (options were granted after I moved to Cali though), and I&#x27;m mainly curious as to how it would be impacted if I move to an income-tax-free state before the options vest

            Same story here. I moved from CA to WA on Jan 4 of one year where that meant I worked a total of two days in CA for that calendar year and it took me at least 4 years of threatening letters and never-ending phone calls before they gave up their claim that I owed CA taxes for half that new year.

            The fact that they&#x27;re nice and polite in contrast with literally every other state agency who&#x27;s taking your money is an indicator that they don&#x27;t have a legal leg to stand on in many cases and don&#x27;t want people digging in their heels and hiring a lawyer.

            I remember this being publicized some years back when a Super Bowl was being held in California, and someone calculated that one team would have to pay California more in taxes for their presence in the state than they would themselves be paid for the privilege of losing the Super Bowl.

            CA taxes the income for the time period you work in the state. They couldn&#x27;t pay more in taxes than they earned. The amount they paid in taxes for CA was likely quite low, as their income during that time probably wouldn&#x27;t come close to the top bracket for yearly income.

            &gt;States tax a player based on their calendar-year income. They apply a duty day calculation which takes the ratio of duty days within the state over total duty days for the year.

            This article is misleading, inaccurate, and reflects poorly on forbes. It&#x27;s phrased as if they&#x27;re paying that much tax on the superbowl winnings, but they&#x27;re being taxed on their normal earnings, during the time they are in CA, which is the case for a number of states with income tax. The article also claims they&#x27;re paying the top rate, without considering marginal taxes.

            I have several neighbors who have fled California (smart bastards), and they knew to make it a very clean break.  First get an apartment in another state; move bank accounts to new &quot;state&quot; bank in new state; get a new driver&#x27;s license in that state; ensure employment address and all &quot;official&quot; addresses are changed, along with any and all other correspondence that&#x27;s possible; sell house and&#x2F;or car -- leave, leave, leave.

            These are all things you should be doing anyway if you&#x27;re moving so it&#x27;s not a particularly high bar to meet.<p>And as with most things, the burden is on you to the extent that you want to actually prove them wrong. If you don&#x27;t find yourself going back to California and you&#x27;re willing to get a nasty letter from them every now and then, it&#x27;s really a non-issue even if they firmly believe you are&#x2F;were a California resident. They can&#x27;t lien property outside of the state. If they put something on your credit report, you can dispute it with the reporting agency (who are much more likely to be reasonable than some FTB bureaucrat). Yes it can be a pain in the ass but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as big of a hurdle as TFA is making it out to be.

            That&#x27;s definitely some IANAL advice that should be supercede by one&#x27;s lawyers advice. For example, it&#x27;s well known for those moving to Puerto Rico under Act 20&#x2F;22 that the safest bet in case you would ever get audited is to close your USA bank accounts to cleanly sever the connection. This applies even if you get new ones from Puerto Rican branches of the same. Once you&#x27;re being audited, all of these factors are plugged into the formula and this is definitely is one of the factors used in determining if you are still substantially connected to the United States.<p>The IRS also looks at if you have joined a church or other social organization in PR. That&#x27;s a rough one for me if I get audited. While I didn&#x27;t end up going to PR, I left the country two years ago and during an audit I would not fare well not being able to point to any social organizations, relationships with the opposite gender, or friendships I have overseas even though lawyers suggest setting all of these up. I&#x27;m not that social so I&#x27;m at risk and hope I don&#x27;t face an audit. (Covid was a big factor in avoiding social contact too.)<p>Although all the about is IRS related, I think it&#x27;s well established that states often work with the IRS procedures as inspiration for their own

            &gt; moving to Puerto Rico under Act 20&#x2F;22<p>That&#x27;s quite out of scope of the California thread though, as it is a much more complex situation. Income in PR is not subject to US taxation (even federal) so it&#x27;s quite unlike moving in or out of a state like California.

There&#x27;s no legitimate reason one would have to sell all property in a state when moving out, for example.

            Imagine you live in California and get a job that pays you $X salary plus equity vesting at 1000 shares per year.<p>After a year, you move out of California and continue at the same job.<p>In year 1, you&#x27;ll pay California taxes on the 1000 shares that vested at the end of that year.<p>What about years 2, 3 and 4? You&#x27;d guess that you wouldn&#x27;t pay any California taxes on those vest events. Because you &#x27;earnt&#x27; those shares after you left CA.<p>Not so fast. Because you were living in CA when those 4000 shares were granted (on a 4 year vesting schedule), you&#x27;ll pay taxes on these proportions of each vesting event:<p>Year 1: 100% (lived in CA since grant to vest date)<p>Year 2: 50% (lived in CA for half the time between grant and vest)<p>Year 3: 33%<p>Year 4: 25%<p>So, even though you lived in CA for only 25% of the time, you pay CA tax on over 50% of your shares.

            My FAANG employer and my CPA both agree I owe tax on RSUs that “partially vested” while a resident. An example of 48 shares of RSUs that vest 1&#x2F;48 every month for 4 years (48 months), and I lived in CA for 6 months after they were granted (not vested, granted). In months 1-6, all were 100% California taxable. In month 7, I owed 6&#x2F;7ths of the normal California tax. In month 8, it was 6&#x2F;8ths. In month 48, the final vest, will be taxed by California at 6&#x2F;48ths of a full resident. My new state also taxes them, but I can deduct taxes I pay to California so I don’t get double-taxes.

            It has 8 lines. 7 of those are metacommentary (aka &quot;noise&quot;). 1 is useful information (&quot;data&quot;). It would be more efficient to have a higher signal-to-noise ratio in comments. Especially when responding to someone who is politely asking a question requesting more information.

            I wouldn&#x27;t get tax advice from random people on the internet. If you make above a certain amount of income, and if you have stock options you likely are, it is worth your while to hire a CPA to do your taxes and get tax advice from.<p>It might sound expensive, but the alternative is worse. Consider a friend of mine during the 1999 stock bubble who had stock options. The bubble burst, and he owed taxes on the bubble amount, even though he never sold the stock. He was bankrupted, lost his house, and moved in with his family to a trailer. He had no idea about the tax consequences of his options.

            Most of that page deals with ISOs and NSOs, which are very different from the case you described. The section &quot;E. Restricted Stock&quot; is itself about Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs) NOT Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), the latter of which is what I imagine most non-executives reading this are getting. In case of RSAs you actually &quot;own&quot; the stock during the vesting period (including having voting rights), so it makes some sense to be taxed on it for that period.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carta.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;breaking-down-rsas-and-rsus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carta.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;breaking-down-rsas-and-rsus&#x2F;</a>.

            It&#x27;s unclear whether RSUs are covered by section E:<p>- RSUs are a type of restricted stock, which suggests that they would be covered by section E. (supporting my earlier assumption.)<p>- The examples in section E talk about &#x27;purchase date&#x27; instead of &#x27;grant date&#x27;, suggesting they&#x27;re talking about RSAs. (supporting your point.)<p>However: RSUs must be covered by that publication somehow. If they&#x27;re not covered by section E, then which section covers them?

            RSUs are, I imagine, not covered by this page because – unlike ISO&#x2F;NSO&#x2F;RSAs – RSU vesting schedules are simply a vague promise by the employer and not something legally binding or formally recognized by tax authorities.

            This is similar in vein to GDPR (hear me out) - not in content of course but in the general thought process (ideology?) of those behind it.<p>California is free to make up whatever nonsense California wants to make up. It doesn&#x27;t mean that anyone needs to recognize it or be bound by it if they&#x27;re in California. Just as the GDPR doesn&#x27;t actually have any authority over US companies that don&#x27;t operate within the EU, if I&#x27;m not a resident of California, California can say whatever it wants about my tax status but that&#x27;s just not how it works in reality. No other state recognizes FTB&#x27;s jurisdiction over former-Californian-now-State-X-residents. If you don&#x27;t live in California when your shares vest, California can <i>claim</i> it has a right to some tax revenue, but it doesn&#x27;t.<p>To my knowledge this hasn&#x27;t been adjudicated to any court outside of California so whether or not it&#x27;s legal in a broader sense remains to be seen. It&#x27;s certainly possible, but until there&#x27;s case law to support California taxing former residents on income earned&#x2F;vested after California residency ended, it&#x27;s fanciful.

            You&#x27;re right about the parallel. If you never again step foot in California, and have no assets in California, then perhaps there&#x27;s no way for California to enforce their claim.<p>But, even if no other state would enforce California&#x27;s claim, couldn&#x27;t the FTB get a court judgement against you in California? And then enforce by nabbing you next time you pass through SFO, or by seizing any property you might have?

            This is basically my understanding.  Any income that could be connected to California will be subject to taxes.  Or at least the FTB will try.<p>I know some folks who left the state and got a “taxes owed” notice from FTB.  They replied with “i haven’t set foot in CA for 3 years, I don’t owe anything” and the FTB dropped it.<p>It’s basically the same as NY and NJ which does it’s best to get its pound of flesh.

            Basically you can&#x27;t claim to have left California if you (even inadvertently) still have significant legal ties to the state. And probably not at all if you spend 9 months a year there.<p>If you move, deliberately cut all official ties like license, voting registration, storage units, etc.<p>All of which makes sense: if you&#x27;re moving these are things you should do anyway. It&#x27;s likely that California is probably much more strict in chasing down these details because its high tax rate makes it attractive to have a legal residence in one state while mostly still operating out of CA.

            You should listen to Mike Birbiglia&#x27;s &quot;My Girlfriend&#x27;s Boyfriend.&quot; In it he tells a story about how he&#x27;s T-boned by a drunk driver, but due to paperwork issues, he&#x27;s on the hook for the damages to his rental car. It becomes an obsession for him, until his girlfriend makes him realize that being right is not as important as being happy, and he just lets it go and pays to make it go away and stop sucking his happiness out of his life.

            So to escape the evil tax board after moving out of California you have to...do normal stuff that you are legally required or otherwise expected to do as a resident of a new state&#x2F;city — like switching your drivers license, registering your cars, registering to vote, making your address change official, not spending &gt;9 months of the year &quot;visiting&quot; California.<p>Yes some well-intentioned people unfortunately get caught in this mess at times, but a far greater number are those who worked for a SV startup for years and conveniently moved to a no-tax state a month before IPO when all their stock became &quot;real&quot;.

            I was in a similar boat a decade ago.  I read the FTB documentation (FTB 1031 Sect. E-L) carefully and just accepted it would be subjective criteria test in court if it ever came down to it.  I started keeping immaculate records (motivated by the IRS&#x27; substantial presence test or bona fide residence test depending on the year and where the family was in terms of which country it was in — e.g., moving to another).  The main points that were relevant — memory serves — were a permanent work contract in the new country and having dissolved housing contracts and similar in CA.  My advice: if going abroad, aim to promote your residency status in the new country to &quot;permanent residency&quot; (cf. Green Card, Niederlassungserlaubnis, Niederlassungsbewilligung) over just  being permitted either temporary or long-term (cf. Aufenthaltserlaubnis, Kurzaufenthaltsbewilligung). It takes some work to earn permanent residency over the others (e.g., being in good standing, language mastery, and ability to substantively demonstrate financial independence).  The idea of earning permanent residency (in a place where it&#x27;s difficult to earn it) and throwing it away to return to CA suddenly would probably appear preposterous in court in terms of FTB arguing that you&#x27;re just away from CA temporarily.<p>I kept a US driver license out of convenience in CA.  Never was a problem, though I transitioned it to another state where I had family ties and a mailing address hear later.<p>I kept my CA bank account out of practicality.  It was the only bank I had dealt with out of about six in rapid succession that was supportive and friendly with my living abroad (e.g., power of attorney, wire transfers without being in-person).<p>Voter registration in CA is fine per Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA).  You are entitled your vote; what will differ is whether the state grants you purely federal or also local voting rights.  You get federal at a minimum.  UOCAVA is a bit hand-wavy with the criteria, so I did transfer my voter registration to the other state where I had the license.<p>For the one year I was half-in California while also being abroad, I still filed taxes accordingly for that year for CA.  IIRC, I might have even filed 0 in a CA FTB form for the next year.<p>So: in short, multiple years with &quot;weak&quot; bureaucratic carryover ties in CA without issue, but ultimately transferred all matters aside from bank account to a state with deeper ties (even if living abroad).  Never an issue.<p>The real monster, which dates back to the US Civil War, is the need to pay and file taxes when domiciled abroad.  You can then add FATCA on top of that as a cherry.  The CA FTB is a dream compared to the IRS here.  I’ve basically accepted that this situation won’t improve in my lifetime.  Maybe my children’s.

            This is my understanding as well.  It&#x27;s not that keeping a CA drivers license means you are a resident, it&#x27;s just one (of many) factors the FTB will use to determine whether or not you are a resident.<p>If you can break major ties with CA (not earning income in the state, you don&#x27;t have a home in the state, you spend less than 30 days a year in the state) and show substantial evidence of residency in another place (employment contract, primary residence, etc) then it&#x27;s a bit cleaner.

            It is not just moving out of State. California also requires former residents to pay taxes if they move to another country, even if you live overseas for the entire year. Before moving to another country, many people transfer their residency to a State that places no obligations on people that aren’t actually in the country.

            But California doesn’t have a tax treaty with other jurisdictions and doesn’t recognize the foreign earned income exclusion (first 100k is tax free federally). This means that even if you don’t owe anything federally (as you earned less than 100k and&#x2F;or worked in a country with a tax treaty and can offset all your federal tax liabilities) you will still owe the state of California money.

            BTW the Federal exception is impossibly narrow to ever meet the first year you are overseas:  a date in February starting overseas is required (it&#x27;s like 10.5 months WITHIN the calendar tax year - e.g. if you move overseas in March of the year, you SOL on the exemption).<p>Pretty much unlikely you&#x27;ll qualify the first year.

            That&#x27;s not how the foreign earned income exclusion works. For example, if you meet the 330-day physical presence test using the 12 months between April 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, you can qualify for a prorated amount of the FEIE.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;p54#en_US_2020_publink100047508" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;p54#en_US_2020_publink10004...</a>

            Some States have residency programs specifically targeted at nomads and expats that do not have a fixed address in the country. You don’t have to live there, you just need to show up in person to do all of the usual paperwork to establish your citizenship in that State.<p>South Dakota is famous for this but a few other States are also popular. From the State’s perspective they are generating a bit of revenue from someone who otherwise consumes no resources, so it is a good deal for both parties.

            You have to fulfill the residency requirements for state X while also not looking like you live in state Y.<p>Like another poster said, you can go to South Dakota for literally a day or two and fulfill their residency requirements, but that is not likely to be enough for tax purposes. You should be employed by a company registered in that state; you should have a physical mailing address in that state (e.g. a PMB); you should file a USPS change of address form listing your new mailing address as your official address and change your registered address with service providers like banks and telecom; you should avoid spending more than 182 days per year in any other state as another poster mentioned; etc.

            I&#x27;m not sure if its an absolute requirement, but remember you are trying to make it appear as if you have moved to that state and made it your state of residence. Not filing a change of address form looks strange without any other data in that context.<p>If you want to avoid people knowing your address, I would recommend using a &quot;private mailbox&quot; (PMB) service and making that your official address. This gives you an address that is recognized as a physical address by most services and USPS but basically functions as a mail proxy: they will receive your packages &#x2F; letters and forward them to another address you provide them. If you are concerned about stalkers or other hostile people, you could have the PMB forward mail and packages to a P.O. Box or commercial mail receiving agency (UPS Store et al) which is not where you live. Escapees and America&#x27;s Mailbox are examples of PMBs with receiving facilities in South Dakota.

            Anyone know how 83(b) elections (aka &quot;early exercise&quot;) works with Californian tax?<p>After the 83(b) election, if you fully vest all the early exercised shares in California, then move elsewhere for a year or more before selling, will California still tax the gains from that sale?<p>On the one hand, I&#x27;m vesting the exercised shares whilst in CA. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve early exercised, so there is no realized gains until I&#x27;ve sold. So if I leave CA, renounce all ties to CA as the article says, then sell, will CA come after me?<p>Is this analogous to buying a share of Google whilst a CA resident, then becoming a resident somewhere else and then selling that share of Google there?

            &quot;There, a nonresident sole proprietor performed all of his services outside of California. However, some of his customers were located in California. Is that enough for the poor guy to attract California tax liability? The California taxing authorities said he was operating a &quot;unitary&quot; business. Therefore, his tiny business was subject to California&#x27;s apportionment rules.&quot;<p>&quot;The California Franchise Tax Board matched income records showing that he collected $40,000 of income from California companies.

            In states with no income taxes, it ends up being the opposite.<p>At least you all get a break.

            I invite you to try attaining home equity in California through labor. Vanishingly few people in the highest reaches of the state&#x27;s most lucrative industry are able to do that.<p>These prices aren&#x27;t made out of saved-up paychecks. Not even for white collar jobs. They are <i>wealth</i>. A group of people who were in the right place at the right time, trading amongst themselves. When an uppity little worker somehow makes enough to break into their club, they take it as a reminder about how that pesky income inequality really needs fixing. Turn up the taxes on wages until he goes away. But no more taxes on our ownership. That&#x27;s out of the question.

That statistic is trending up.<p>There are estimated to be 13.3 million housing units in California[2]. This means 7.3 million of those units are owned by their occupant(s). The <i>adult</i> population (&gt;=18yo) of California is estimated to be 24.9 million[3]. So if we assume all 7.3 million owner occupied housing units have a single owner-occupant, this would mean that approximately 29% of adult Californians own their residence.

            The median home price is $818k [0]. That works out to about $3,400&#x2F;month. To afford that you need to make $130k [1]. That is an 89th percentile wage locally [2]. And that&#x27;s a single family home. In the cities for that price we&#x27;re probably talking about a condo with a $500-$1000 monthly HOA.<p>The vast majority of the value in these homes is appreciation. Having more in appreciated asset value than 90% of your neighbors could ever catch up to through wages is <i>exactly</i> what defines the moneyed, flying-over-everything class.<p>I have a home in California, btw. I was able to stretch for a 1BR condo by earning half a million a year. That is definitely not what most other homeowners did, and it&#x27;s not as if the people with 2BR and 3BR have even better salaries.

            It&#x27;s complicated in CA. Yes, they stay local in the county and are meant to fund education. The caveat is that due to proposition 13 property taxes no longer are able to fund education completely and the state has to step in to cover the gap, so property taxes have a large impact on the state budget.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lao.ca.gov&#x2F;reports&#x2F;2012&#x2F;tax&#x2F;property-tax-primer-112912.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lao.ca.gov&#x2F;reports&#x2F;2012&#x2F;tax&#x2F;property-tax-primer-1129...</a>

            It is pretty useless to have a single ranking for tax rates when people of various incomes have various tax rates.  This report gives a better idea for an individual’s tax rate based on income, although it does not take into account personal circumstances due to prop 13 in CA:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itep.org&#x2F;whopays-map&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itep.org&#x2F;whopays-map&#x2F;</a>

            I think both are relevant. States have many differences and more or less progressive structures, but average revenue&#x2F;spend tells an important part of the story.<p>If a state (e.g. California) is collecting and spending 50% than average on a per capita basis, it begs the question of what that money is spent on, and if there are diminishing returns in value.

            Depending on how you count, California has about the 10th highest total tax burden among US states.

            No free meds in Canada. Well, not for most people. And no dental care coverage either. Just doctor&#x2F;hospital care.
Education isn&#x27;t almost free. Annual tuition is $7k-$8k CAD ($6.5kish USD) a year. 
And subsidized child care is... dicey. Depends on province, etc. and unlikely to find availability.<p>As for parental leave, could you live on $595 CAD ($472 USD) a week? That&#x27;s the maximum... Not ideal in the Toronto area where the average for a 1 bedroom apartment is around $2000 CAD a month.  It certainly helps a lot when you have a working spouse, but it&#x27;s not enough to raise a child on your own.<p>It&#x27;s not a worker&#x27;s paradise up here.

            Well, meds while in hospital are free, and otherwise they are much cheaper or offered for free to qualified individuals. So they&#x27;re either cheap or free.<p>I&#x27;d consider that almost free education haha, but also I&#x27;m from Quebec, so the average is 3k per year for tuition (also why can&#x27;t other province follow suit here). In any case, it&#x27;s far away from a 60k tuition you can get in the US. You won&#x27;t really see anything above 16k per year in Canada even for med school at the best university.<p>I&#x27;m also from Quebec, so for childcare you get 7$ per day, but yes it can be hard to find availability.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d be happy with unpaid parental leave even, but off course I&#x27;m an engineer, so I can afford it. I think a lot of parents can afford having one at home with 500$ a month and the other working. So it&#x27;s still a pretty big perk.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not a worker&#x27;s paradise up here. It&#x27;s better than it could be though<p>I think that&#x27;s slightly off topic, California has way better jobs for engineers, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m no longer in Canada. But job availability and pay is kind of orthogonal to taxes (unless you&#x27;d tell me the tax money goes towards attracting higher paying jobs to the state).<p>So the question remains, where the hell does the tax money go here? And why can&#x27;t they offer as many services when the taxes are just as high, especially considering the state is way richer than any province in Canada, it seems they could afford to offer even more services than in Quebec for all that money.

            CA is particularly bad but I&#x27;ve seen this from smaller states as well. I went to grad-school in PA (CMU). After graduating and moving out of PA, a couple years later PA demanded taxes on income I only earned after leaving the state.<p>It amounted to only like $40 and I was afraid it&#x27;d cost way more to fight so I just paid it, even though it was a completly fabricated tax bill. Today I&#x27;d fight it just on principle but I was too poor then and couldn&#x27;t afford to talk to a CPA or lawyer.

            My tax attorney gave me a list similar to that, but it only had 19 items.  I think the items I didn&#x27;t see on the other list were birthday cards, clubs and social groups and heirlooms.  They&#x27;ve had some clients get grief from the FTB but a phone call can sort it out.  My attorney of course offered to do this for me.  This is my last year in California so I guess I will find out how hard this is.

            Taxes are based on where the work is performed, not where your employer is located in all US states in aware of. So remote work solely out of your home in Reno, NV for a California company would have no state income taxes (since Nevada doesn&#x27;t have state income tax).

            I don&#x27;t do a ton of contract and I don&#x27;t like CA taxes. But this seems slightly antagonistic. Hiring a CPA will make taxes easier, both of these can mainly be solved with more money.<p>Why are recruiters negotiating with you about whether or not 13% is a far increase for being in CA? To me it seems like the high end for comp in Silicon Valley is much higher than the high end for comp in Texas. And 10-20% salary adjustment for an internal move between a MCOL city and Silicon Valley seems normal.<p>I don&#x27;t know your situation, but a 15% bump for working in CA sounds cheap in general.

            WA taxes capital gains profits which exceed $250k annually.  The rate is also less than you&#x27;d likely pay in CA(max 13%?).  Not great, but better than CA.<p>The thing that gets me about WA are the insane liquor taxes(and higher base prices as well for some reason).  OR isn&#x27;t too far away though, and they seem to have reasonable prices despite the state liquor monopoly.

            A tax that starts at 90% for low income people and ends up at 2000% for high net worth individuals would be the one of the most progressive tax systems imaginable and yet would be completely unaffordable.

            A reasonable proxy is state expenditure per capita.<p>In the case of california, the state happens to collect a disproportionate amount from cap gains which helped in 2020 and caused a crisis in 2008. Also spending is higher per capita in the less densely settled (and predominantly Republican) portions of the state (most of it if you look at a political map) simply because the infrastructure is thinner and more critical and social services are more expensive to provide.
