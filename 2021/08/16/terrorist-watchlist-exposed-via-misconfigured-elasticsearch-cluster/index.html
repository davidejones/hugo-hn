            &gt; “The terrorist watchlist is made up of people who are suspected of terrorism but who have not necessarily been charged with any crime,” Diachenko wrote. “In the wrong hands, this list could be used to oppress, harass, or persecute people on the list and their families. It could cause any number of personal and professional problems for innocent people whose names are included in the list.”<p>I’m curious how many journalists are on the list. Now that we are pulling out of Afghanistan, we should reevaluate the other actions we took after 9&#x2F;11. The patriot act deserves another look and possible edit.

            &gt; but this began with gang affiliation lists<p>Civil courts have been able to exercise significant control of your life, including extended imprisonment without due process, for longer than these lists have been in effect. Frankly Americans have a lot fewer rights than they think they have, including the non-right of due process for being on a government list.<p>Edit: To pre-empt some comments I know are coming, civil courts do not require due process in the way you probably think of due process: a civil court can act against you without giving you representation, without allowing you to have representation, without you present, in secret from the public, and even without notifying you<p>EDIT2: While I&#x27;m soapboxing I&#x27;ll note the power the civil court has over you isn&#x27;t much different than the power three-letter agencies have over you (since they are usually given very broad mandates), it&#x27;s just that civil courts have been around so much longer it&#x27;s a good retort to people thinking they used to have rights. Whatever three-letters can&#x27;t do to you is generally picked up by similar state agencies.

There are typically strict  requirements that have to be met before civil court can render a ruling or judgment without a party present, especially where there is no indication that the party has received notice first.<p>A lot of anecdotes about drastic judgments and rulings being handed down by civil courts happen when parties ignore notice of the proceedings. There are a lot of rules for handling cases in civil court and they are grounded in the constitutional right to due process. Notice and due process are taken really seriously in most US jurisdictions. Federal Courts are especially strict about following the rules.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;rules&#x2F;frcp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;rules&#x2F;frcp</a>

            I think the brunt of their points are there are few protections and they tend to have far to much power over those who not in the 1% and can afford to drag a case out for years. Also judges are people too and quite often are affected by emotion. Statistically your are significantly more likely to get off with a better judgement if they&#x27;ve just had a good lunch. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;justice-is-served-but-more-so-after-lunch-how-food-breaks-sway-the-decisions-of-judges" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;justice-is-ser...</a>

            I honestly don&#x27;t see a good reason.<p>The process is commonly abused by divorce lawyers to gain control of the house for their client, and the bar for evidence is extremely low. The way our adversarial justice system is supposed to work is that the truth comes out in a fair fight. This process obviously ignores this foundation.<p>If there&#x27;s really enough evidence to suggest immediate violence, then they should be arrested for terroristic threats and other stuff. And let&#x27;s not forget that the protective order is just a piece of paper and won&#x27;t stop any violence if the person is truly motivated.<p>Frankly, I think a lot of civil court actions have been created just to avoid the protections guaranteed in the criminal system.

            That’s by design to make justice more accessible. IIRC, you can petition the judge to adjourn the case and move it to normal court.<p>Also, I believe in small claims as a defendant you can appoint an attorney to represent you.

            I&#x27;ve never had a good experience &quot;pre-empting&quot; comments that will inevitably be used to derail your thread.<p>In any case, I was mostly thinking that it has to be a form of privilege to feel like a particular slippery slope hasn&#x27;t happened yet. I think about how the word &quot;privilege&quot; is used, and its more like &quot;exemption from some inconveniences that aren&#x27;t obvious&quot;. Your post about people not noticing that civil courts and agencies have these power over assumed rights is a decent example of that.

            Worse than that, sometimes these intelligence agencies create said terrorists.<p>&gt; Of these defendants caught up in FBI terrorism sting operations, an FBI informant was the person who led one of every three terrorist plots, and the FBI also provided all of the necessary weapons, money, and transportation.<p>I&#x27;m sure such a thing is something no American would agree with. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if similar actions were happening at all levels (gangs to terrorists).

            Here&#x27;s my positions, but of course I&#x27;m open to other opinions. I wrote a big list and I realized I could distill a lot of my ideas. For one I&#x27;m a big fan of STAR and Approval voting. We&#x27;ve seen over a hundred years of ordinal methods in various countries (including America) and seen the failure. Time to move to what the experts are suggesting. Which brings me to the second point. Lots of these topics are extremely complex and contain a lot of nuance. Us non-experts can see a high level but sometimes these nuanced points matter a lot. So let&#x27;s not be so aggressive in asserting how right we are. Also, we need to focus on unity. Mic drops and calling people names doesn&#x27;t help us. We need nuanced and calm conversations. Our fellow citizens, no matter how crazy their beliefs, are not our enemies. Don&#x27;t dehumanize people, that&#x27;s divide and rule. Lastly, we need to stay focused. I think there is a new thing to be outraged about every other day. Let&#x27;s talk about what the big important problems are and focus on those first. Let&#x27;s recognize that doing so isn&#x27;t dismissing the other problems. We only have so much bandwidth. Right now we have no such priority list, we&#x27;re just jumping from thing to thing. Solving problems takes time (a thing we often forget). If our attention to the problem is shorter than the time it takes to solve the problem then we will never solve these problems.<p>Edit: One thing I wanted to add is that we can have different groups focus on different things. It&#x27;s not a zero sum game. This is because not everyone is an expert in everything, and thus the utility they contribute isn&#x27;t the same as every task they contribute to.

            You refuse the two party system and work on a third party geared towards pre-emptive avoidance of the corruption mechanisms that got the two big ones. Do that at the local and state level first, attacking gerrymandering and other incumbent favoring electoral manipulation methods to weaken the two party strangle hold, such as heavy petitioning and lobbying to force state Secretaries of State to fix election laws.<p>Until we the people are actually represented in the legislative branch nothing fundamental will change. Being that the other branches are largely unaccountable to the citizenry, the legislative branch is the logical entity to focus on (and the fourth estate, heavily under attack by the executive et al)

            Under the US system as it is, with first-past-the-post voting and all votes for a state going to the presidential candidate who got the most, a third party can&#x27;t gain any traction. Worse, third parties under the US system are another vehicle for corruption (example: Republicans paying fees and collecting signatures to get Greens on the ballot to divide the left vote and get a Republican in office, though this problem could be fixed with some form of instant runoff).  You&#x27;d need constitutional reform.<p>While imperfect, I think that German electoral system is much better. Any party that gets 5% or more of the vote is guaranteed fair representation, gerrymandering isn&#x27;t a possibility.<p>However, in a multiparty system deals still have to be struck to put together governing coalitions, so a party that insists on being purist is likely to be shut out.

            &gt; to get Greens on the ballot to divide the left vote and get a Republican in office<p>If people are serious about voting reform (and they should be) then this &quot;spoiler effect&quot; can be weaponized:  start a grassroots campaign to vote third party until the Democrats support changing the voting system at the state level (and vote in primaries for Democrats who support this change).<p>This may lead to few tight state races being lost, but that means that only a small percentage of the population would be enough to get the Democratic Party officials to take notice.  To make the signal even more clear, the third party chosen should be one that focuses as narrowly as possible on voting reform, such as the Alliance Party[0], which may also encourage some disgruntled Republicans to temporarily lend their votes, whereas they would be more reluctant to support the Green Party, for example.<p>Of course there is a danger that voting reform would get portrayed as a pro-Democrat policy (if it isn&#x27;t already), but once enough Republicans (in majority Democrat states) have experience casting their ballot in a more expressive and representative system, it will be harder for Republicans in other states to oppose it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theallianceparty.com&#x2F;political_reform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theallianceparty.com&#x2F;political_reform</a>

            To be honest, a lot of this is already happening and I don&#x27;t think the Democrats care. When voter turnout is high, Democrats win hands down. When voter turnout is low, Republicans win. But the kicker is that both parties thrive when they are losing. This may often be counter intuitive to many people but I think many have bad priors when modeling the game that politicians are playing.

            Actually, Democrats are generally in favor of instant runoff voting, and many more liberal places have enacted it.<p>But yes, there are a lot of professional campaign consultants who have the system wired that they profit whether they win or lose, and many of those work for Democrats.

            We are looking at a republican party the majority of which would happily end democracy to end the threat of them ever being tossed out again. Tipping the scales in their direction at this critical juncture to motivate Democrats seems like a spectacularly bad idea.<p>Seems like it would be a better and safer idea to to work towards the same goal using primaries to tilt already democratic districts in the direction of reformers.

            &gt; While imperfect, I think that German electoral system is much better.<p>I often see people compare the US system to European systems and use &quot;party&quot; in both. I think this results in a pretty bad comparison, but takes some nuance to understand why. Democrats and Republicans are more accurately compared to coalitions in European systems than they are to European parties. As a point, AOC or Bernie have very different political ideologies than say Pelosi or Biden, yet are in the same party. Similarly Trump is very different ideologically than say John Kasich. While there is variance within European political parties I believe that we see a larger variance within American parties and thus it makes it more accurate to compare to coalitions.<p>In addition to this we should recognize that most European systems are working under a parliamentary system which causes this proportionate representation. We don&#x27;t quite have a system like that in America and it would be tough to change the entire system. This is why many people, such as myself, are proposing systems like STAR or Approval. By being able to score (or rate) candidates (instead of ranking) we can achieve a proportionate representation with very minimal change, especially since systems like Approval already work on current voting machines. It is also a lot easier and more transparent compared to many round systems from ordinal voting.<p>&gt;(example: Republicans paying fees and collecting signatures to get Greens on the ballot to divide the left vote and get a Republican in office, though this problem could be fixed with some form of instant runoff<p>But I also want to be clear about this. Ordinal systems (such as IRV&#x2F;STV) fix this kind of spoiler there is another spoiler that is fairly important: the favorite betrayer. That is because the green party here is called a weak spoiler, they don&#x27;t have a large voter base. But we need to also be VERY concerned with strong spoilers. For example: if Bernie ran against Biden. Ordinal systems are still vulnerable to this type of spoiler while cardinal systems are resistant to both strong and weak spoilers.<p>Edit: I wanted to add that we actually saw strong spoilers in the 2016 and 2020 elections, in the primaries. In 2016 it happened in both parties. Bernie and Clinton were a split. Many people didn&#x27;t vote Bernie because they thought Hillary would better beat Trump. Similarly in the Republican party you had Trump, Cruz, and Kasich. Many Republicans liked a moderate like Kasich but didn&#x27;t think he was a strong candidate. In the 2020 election we again saw this vote splitting in the Democratic primaries. While these cases are more obvious, such splitting also happens a lot in congressional races and other down ballot races.

            &gt; most European systems are working under a parliamentary system which causes this proportionate representation.<p>Could you clarify what you mean here?  There is nothing about a parliamentary system which inherently requires or leads to proportional representation, as the UK system shows.  Similarly it would be possible in the US congressional system to have proportional representation by having multi-member districts (as was allowed[0] before 1967) and using a system like STV, also called multi-winner ranked-choice voting.[1]<p>&gt; cardinal systems are resistant to both strong and weak spoilers.<p>While I support any serious alternative to FPTP, it&#x27;s worth being aware of the deficiencies of Approval voting.  Firstly, it can confront voters with difficult questions about whether they support a certain candidate enough to approve of them.  For example, a Democrat voter might hedge their bets by voting for a moderate Republican to prevent a more extreme Republican winning, while hoping that enough Republicans approve of a moderate Democrat.<p>Secondly, though, I think that an important goal for a voting systems is that it doesn&#x27;t increase (and ideally decreases) the dependence on voting machines.  As recent events have shown, every additional element to a voting system is just expanding the attack surface for people to target FUD at, and a voting machine is a complex system which is very hard for the average voter to reason about (even if the purported hardware designs and source code were publicly available).<p>While it is still feasible to count Approval ballots by hand, and the process can be split between districts to produce sub-totals which can be summed, the fact that a given ballot can have multiple marks on it does increase the complexity for human counters, which makes the counting slower and more expensive.  In particular, if there are N candidates in an election, then a FPTP ballot can be placed onto one of N piles, whereas 2^N piles are needed to group all possible Approval votes physically together.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much that complexity would actually slow down the counting, but in a world where election workers are being threatened with violence for doing their job, even an extra hour of counting is hard to justify.  Fortunately, though, there is a voting system which satisfies the above criteria, namely Asset Voting.[2]  In its single-winner variant, the election proceeds just like a FPTP one, with the same ballot papers, instructions, and counting process, but after the count is complete, the candidates from fewest to most votes get to reassign their share to a remaining candidate, until one candidate has a majority.  This removes the spoiler problem, and relies on the fact that voters are choosing someone to represent them and who can therefore be entrusted with the job of assigning their votes to the ultimate winner if necessary.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amacad.org&#x2F;ourcommonpurpose&#x2F;recommendation-1-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amacad.org&#x2F;ourcommonpurpose&#x2F;recommendation-1-3</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Single_transferable_vote" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Single_transferable_vote</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Proportional_representation#Asset_voting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Proportional_representation#As...</a>

            The third party would need to get local traction first.  This is the best way forward on a number of dimensions, but most third party candidates go national instead, because while it cannot effect change, it is substantially more profitable.

            Honestly voting is high on my priority list. The reason is because I believe that voting will have a lot of downstream effects. It will make a lot of other things easier. But I don&#x27;t believe we should be trying to change things at the national level at this point (that&#x27;s down the line). I think we should be trying to implement systems like STAR and Approval at local levels. City, County, State. We know that these are the systems the experts are suggesting. So let&#x27;s stop doing the same experiment we&#x27;ve seen fail a hundred times. And while the dragon is the end goal, if we can&#x27;t defeat the low level monsters it would be insane to go fight the final boss.

            plus even more relevant to HN is when authorities are using algorithms as a scapegoat. we probably know what will happen when they start using black box ML with a ton of bias baked in.<p>There is a scary (gross in my mind) story that reports on some dystopian pre-crime Minority Report Sheriff targeting kids.<p>Looks like the court case is in process, though not sure why court didn&#x27;t immediately shut it down pending trial given how (to my non-lawyer brain) this seems that plaintiffs will almost definitely prevail given clear violations of multiple Amendments.<p>From the reporting:
&quot;Over the span of five months, police went to his home 21 times. They also showed up at his gym and his parent’s place of work. The Tampa Bay Times revealed that since 2015, the sheriff&#x27;s office has made more than 12,500 similar preemptive visits to people.<p>These visits often resulted in other, unrelated fines and arrests that further victimized families and added to the likelihood that they would be visited and harassed again. In one incident, the mother of a targeted teenager was issued a $2,500 fine for having chickens in the backyard. In another incident, a father was arrested because his 17-year-old was smoking a cigarette. These behaviors occur in all neighborhoods, across all economic strata—but only marginalized people, who live under near constant police scrutiny, face penalization.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.tampabay.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;2020&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;police-pasco-sheriff-targeted&#x2F;school-data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.tampabay.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;2020&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;p...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ij.org&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;pasco-families-win-round-one-in-lawsuit-challenging-predictive-policing-program&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ij.org&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;pasco-families-win-round-one-in...</a>

            I&#x27;ve heard of this, going back a year or two. The sheriff&#x27;s target the households presented by the algorithms with the intention of fining, arresting, and otherwise legally harassing the targeted families in an attempt to drive them out of town.<p>Selective enforcement of laws is a problem, and there are plenty of laws to selectively enforce.

            &gt; fine for having chickens in the backyard<p>Land of the free. The arbitrary harassment of the population is one thing, but then there is that mountain of actual laws and regulations that would be considered an overreach even by the standards of most totalitarian dictatorships in the world.

            The slippery slope is only a fallacy if there is no reasoning presented between steps though.<p>&quot;We should track who is gang affiliated&quot; -&gt; &quot;We should track who has done terroristic acts&quot; -&gt; &quot;We should track who is affiliated with terrorists&quot; -&gt; &quot;We should track who may be affiliated with them&quot;<p>All seem to be reasonable steps, which IMO makes it not a case of the slope being a fallacy.

            &gt;but this began with gang affiliation lists.<p>An old coworker of mine was on a gang registry because of people he associated with when he was a teenager. He was in his late 20&#x27;s-early 30&#x27;s when we worked together. Really nice guy, super hard working, spent his free time gaming or hanging out with his girlfriend, got really into his puppy and being a dog owner. Hadn&#x27;t been around gangsters for at least a decade.<p>He&#x27;d regularly get pulled over and hassled by cops just because when they scanned his plate he&#x27;d show up as being on the gang registry. Ended up losing his license for several months because his friend who was his passenger one time had a very small amount of weed in a bag in his pocket when he got pulled over.<p>Pretty much any time cops are around or even whenever he drives, there&#x27;s always a chance he&#x27;s going to get pulled over and harassed randomly.<p>Not because of anything he ever did, just because he chose the wrong friends when he was young.

            Yes, that is a problem. But that&#x27;s not what the parent poster is talking about.

            &gt; Imagining disasters is how we&#x27;re in this mess<p>I posted some links in my original comment that talk about specific problems. That being said, &quot;allowing those in authority to do things that could be used inappropriately... and then it turning out that they did exactly that&quot; doesn&#x27;t require ANY imagination.

            Please note the four demands the ACLU makes in the publication you linked.<p>None of them demand that police lists should not exist, or that judicial oversight should be necessary to put a person on one.<p>Instead, they demand that:<p>1. The lists be accurate.<p>2. The lists be accurate.<p>3. Allowing people to contest them on a case-by-case basis.<p>4. To not blacklist people from employment based on them.<p>The ACLU seems to be in agreement with me.

            I don&#x27;t see them agreeing with you at all. I see you saying &quot;the lists are fine&quot;, whereas they are saying &quot;the lists are not fine, but would be ok if these things were true (but they&#x27;re not atm)&quot;. Personally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough. I think someone being known to be on the terror watch list is likely to cause them all sorts of problems; and anyone can be put on the list for pretty much any reason.

            This is how the KGB, Stasi, and other secret police organizations work. It&#x27;s a way to extra-judicially monitor and control the population. This should give you pause for thought. Law enforcement that the public can trust is a big deal. Our government already bends the laws quite a bit to suppress dissent, we shouldn&#x27;t enable them to do more of this.<p>It&#x27;s a lot more straight-forward if the police investigate crimes reported to them by citizens. That&#x27;s what they are supposedly there for, right?

            Dismantling the State&#x27;s oppression system goes further than having legal constructs expire. As long as there is parliaments, police, prisons and borders, the State will use those to oppress people, and no amount of using the oppressor&#x27;s tools (legislation) can change that.<p>&quot;Just&quot; dismantle the psychopathic institutions that govern our societies (a revolution) and make sure anyone who attempts to rebuild them is look down on with contempt.

            Most journalists working for big outlets are docile when asked politely not to publish on a certain topic (either by their boss, or by government agencies), and that&#x27;s how they avoid problems. See for example Glenn Greenwald&#x27;s choice to leave the Guardian in order to publish the Snowden papers. For the french-speaking among us (not sure you can find english subtitles), the documentary &quot;Les nouveaux chiens de garde&quot; (the new watchdogs) goes into detail, interviewing sociologists and journalists, about the ties between the mainstream capitalist media establishment and other circles of power (industry, political parties).<p>About the no-fly list specifically, you should really check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_Fly_List#Notable_cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_Fly_List#Notable_cases</a> . Some relevant quotes:<p>&gt; TSA refused to allow an Air France flight from Paris to Mexico to cross U.S. airspace because it was carrying Colombian journalist Hernando Calvo Ospina<p>&gt; On August 19, 2009, Air France flight AF-438 was not allowed to cross into U.S. airspace because of the presence on board of one Paul-Emile Dupret, a civil servant at the European Parliament for 18 years, who had written some articles criticizing the EU&#x27;s policies toward Latin America because they are aligned too closely with those of the United States<p>&gt; A U.S. citizen, stranded in Colombia after being placed on the No Fly List as a result of having studied in Yemen<p>&gt; In October 2008, the Washington Post reported that Maryland State Police classified 53 nonviolent political activists as terrorists, and entered their names and personal information into state and federal databases<p>Seems like it&#x27;s not hard in practice for psychopaths in uniforms to abuse secretive powers given to them.

            Some things were made permanent under subsequent laws (or at least extended). For example, financial reporting for people depositing &quot;large&quot; amounts of cash. I think it started out at $10k under the patriot act. Now I think it&#x27;s $5k. That is a good bit of cash, but it could easily be made selling a used car or something.

            90% of the Patriot Act was permanent law and is law today. A few of the most objectionable parts had &quot;sunset&quot; provisions in them and those (after several rounds of modifications and numerous extensions) are what has, finally, been allowed to expire. Most of the provisions of the Patriot Act are in effect today and will be until a future Congress changes them.

            Likely just Baader–Meinhof phenomenon[1]. Interestingly, I think that phenomenon ignores the superset of when you actually had seen something multiple times before but for whatever reason started noticing the frequency more frequently (eg you’ve seen backronym’s before, but you’re happening but your brain has decided to notice them more because maybe you saw them in quicker succession than you’re used to).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Frequency_illusion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Frequency_illusion</a>

The terror watch list had about 1.9M though, so this must be the terror watch list.<p>1.9M people is a massive number of people<p>&gt; The No Fly List is different from the Terrorist Watch List, a much longer list of people said to be suspected of some involvement with terrorism. As of June 2016, the Terrorist Watch List is estimated to contain over 2,484,442 records, consisting of 1,877,133 individual identities.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_Fly_List" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_Fly_List</a>

            &gt;1.9M people is a massive number of people<p>I would say incredibly massive.<p>I mean, to get onto that &quot;terrorist&quot; list (if it is of US origin) most probably it means that the person must have traveled to or within the US by plane (or applied for a Visa, or similar), otherwise the fields of passport_id and country_of_issuance can be empty and (false or real) matches only depend on name, surname and date of birth.<p>In Italy something that is similar to the US SSN is the Codice Fiscale that can be thought as a condensed string based on Surname, Name, Sex, Date of birth, and place of birth (each italian comune, think of a municipality has its own alphanumeric code).<p>At the time it was introduced, there were of course a number of &quot;collisions&quot; due to homonimy or partial homonimy (the algorithm uses only some consonants of Surname and Name, making collisions more likely) and a provision for an &quot;exception&quot; was made, altering last character (which is a control character and normally is a sort of hash of the other data).<p>This allowed up to 26 people born in the same municipality on the same day and with same (or similar) surname and name to get a distinct codice fiscale.<p>For strangers the code for place of birth is instead of municipality the much more generic country of birth.<p>The amount of collisions with foreigners staying in Italy or however needing the codice fiscale (coming from a few countries) zoomed to higher than that and now there are quite a few &quot;non-standard&quot; codice fiscale where one (or more) of the numeric characters has been replaced by a letter character according to a substitution algorithm 0=L, 1=M, etc. starting from the last (rightmost) number.<p>This has raised the number of possibilities from 26 to (I believe) 128 or so and for the moment the system still works.<p>However, last data I could find, is 2016 and there were  36,000 &quot;collisions&quot; on 94,000,000 total, (in 2000 it was some 24,000 on 80,000,000 or so).<p>I wonder what kind of probabilities there are, if you have a common enough name and you are born in a country for which there are many entries in that list to be &quot;picked&quot; for homonimy, if the passport info is either empty or not used.

            You know, I can understand why the Terrorist Watch List is secret ― but not why the No Fly list is. If there is a list that governmental agencies and&#x2F;or commercial companies are <i>obliged</i> to check you&#x27;re not on before providing you with their service, then <i>surely</i> such list must be public or at the very least, one should be able to easily inquire about whether he&#x2F;she is on it or not.<p>For a related example, Russian government maintains a list of banned Internet resources. The list is not public — at least in theory — but there is an official web site where you can input an URL or a domain name and it would response either with &quot;no, it&#x27;s not on the list&quot;, or with &quot;yes, it&#x27;s on the list, here&#x27;s who ordered it and when&quot;.

            Surely the easy way to check if a name is on the list is to book a flight in that name.  If the booking gets rejected, it&#x27;s on the list.<p>Repeat for every name you want to check, and make use of the airlines free cancellation policy so you don&#x27;t actually have to spend money.

            I knew a Mexican citizen with a green card who was always having trouble reentering the US and never knew why. I looked at the most wanted list and saw there was a fugitive with the same first and middle name, albeit no resemblance and different family name. Didn&#x27;t matter.

            As expected, it is only a matter of time untill all the intensely private data collected by NSA and pals is leaked or stolen and used by criminals for fraud and extortion.

            The main databases the NSA has are far too large to be easily leaked.<p>Even blueleaks was &lt;1T (~300GB iirc) and many people had trouble downloading it.  I am sure many IC databases are several hundreds or thousands of times larger even without indices.<p>It&#x27;s not like you could just throw up a 4000TB torrent for a 7z of all of the north american phone call metadata for last year.

            When I worked on the main NRO ground processing station for electro-optical collections, we were generating double-digit petabytes daily, and that back in 2008. Don&#x27;t even know what it&#x27;s up to now.<p>Not only is there no practical way for anyone other than maybe Google or CERN to download that much data, unlike the no-fly list, actual classified information isn&#x27;t attached to any networks that can be accessed from outside of a secure facility. This means the only way to egress data is for an inside threat to copy it onto USB drives or possibly optical media, maybe steal hard drives. But there are pretty hard limits to what you can just bulk copy. It can&#x27;t be much more than a person can hide in a bag.

            It&#x27;s amazing how many hacks and data breaches all come down to dangerous default settings. Elasticsearch defaulted to no security, anyone hitting the IP has full access to the cluster. MongoDB is another infamous example. Even today, one of my sites is being DDoSed by a bunch of 2007-era Ubiquiti network devices which use ubnt &#x2F; ubnt as the root login and naturally got exposed to the internet. Bad defaults linger for a long time.

            Wonder if they did it on purpose. I can&#x27;t figure out what the purpose might be - a whistleblower wanting to raise awareness about it and realizing they didn&#x27;t want to have to relocate to Russia or say live an Ecuadorian embassy for years. Or, I can imagine, a rogue agent wanting to warn someone they are on the list without communicating with them privately, so there is no metadata linking them, and they &quot;accidentally&quot; leaked the whole list.

            What really bugs me about these lists isn&#x27;t just that they exist, but that there&#x27;s continuous clamoring to expand the scope in which they are applied.

            Databases of people are the exact opposite of human rights. IBM famously enabled the nazi holocaust to go faster&#x2F;further because of their punch-card databases. Eastern Germany Stasi, and KGB&#x2F;FBI scandals famously pushed for privacy regulations in pretend-free countries like France (Loi Informatique et Libertés, 1978). Anything that uniquely identify someone else (ID card, phone number, DNA) is a tool of tyrants to oppress their people.

Find the cases that are wrong and sue those responsible behind the desks. This is the only way this can stop.<p>The website is extremely horrible. Did use a dev browser without adblock. Grave mistake.

            I’m curious if anyone who is on the leaked list now has standing in court to litigate their status, whereas they could not prove their status&#x2F;data before.<p>One of my biggest complaints with national security programs is that they tend to argue that transparency (even to the voters and elected representatives whom these programs ostensibly protect) threatens the program. Sometimes when leaks happen, it gives the citizens a tool they didn’t previously have to challenge those programs.

            Just an hour ago I was having a dialogue with someone on Hacker News saying we needed a national ID system after the T-Mobile hack. I said that the US Government should not be trusted to be any more secure than T-Mobile with such a system.<p>I rest my case.

            A national ID doesn&#x27;t necessarily have data security implications any more than the current state-by-state DMV system does.<p>The relevance of a national ID is (presumably) so that banks can check identity more reliably, i.e. making security breaches like the T-Mobile one irrelevant. It wouldn&#x27;t matter if your SSN was public information.

            Genuine question because I don&#x27;t really understand how IDs work in the US: is there a database or a system that would allow an agency to keep track of all of your IDs, like driving licenses from different states, etc.? Is there anything similar that institutions like banks could use? Also, my understanding is that most Americans use a driving license as their ID. Are passports the only national, i.e., not state-level, IDs available to Americans?

            Passport and SSN are national ids. They are issued by the Federal government, so it is nation wide database.<p>On top of that, states have their own ID systems. Typically there are 2 options: just a state ID or driver’s license, that serves also as an ID. Most people in the US get driver’s license early(permits as early as 15), so there aren’t that many who has just the ID.<p>Now, SSN is issues upon birth. Before you know it, you can already start paying taxes.<p>For passport you need to apply, typically you would need it if you wanted to travel outside of the US. Otherwise, you rarely need it. This is because for the most part you deal with state bureaucracy, as most of the day to day life falls within state’s jurisdiction. Driving, getting married, divorced, buying things like a vehicle or a real estate, opening a bank account, domestic aur travel, etc. Some can live their entire lives without a passport, because a state ID will suffice. Even for things like voting in federal elections - you don’t need a passport. Contrary to many people’s beliefs, in the US the states vote, not people. This is&#x2F;was by design. Now it gets more centralized, but the original concept is close to EU in terms of states autonomy. This means, that even for federal elections procedures vary greatly by state (its been on the news a lot lately). Moreover, you aren’t required to have an ID. It is not illegal not to have an ID or be off the grid.<p>Before 9&#x2F;11 you could even go to Canada using state ID only. Now I think even it’s possible, probably only if you have some special kind of ID.<p>This is how things have been until recently. Then REAL ID came around. Because states rules governing ID issuance, they vary greatly. So we ended up with some states’ IDs that were as easy to counterfeit as printing a piece of paper. Some states would not do a due diligence verifying your name or address and would just take your word for it. READ ID is to addresses: mandates minimum protection level, due diligence a state needs to do to confirm address, etc. New federal regulations does not allow air travel with state ID that don’t comply with REAL ID requirements. Few states still don’t, so residents of those states will need passports for domestic travel. I think this trend will continue beyond air travel.<p>States aren’t required to share this data with federal government or each other. It is, however, a requirement for REAL ID. At the same time there are many businesses, that specialize in aggregating various identity information a out people. Credit bureaus are such businesses as well. They aren’t only in business of credit checks, but also identity verification, employment verification, etc. Some of these companies have federal, state and local agencies among their clients.<p>Fun fact: you can board a domestic flight without an ID. For example, if you lost it. TSA has a procedure to establish your identity. This includes asking you a bunch of facts about your life, such as where you lived in year X, last 3 cars you owned, your spouse full name and birthday,   etc. I suspect they maybe using one of the credit bureaus identity verification product offerings.

            I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect the FBI to not expose this. I&#x27;m with you on Elasticsearch being too insecure but you&#x27;re talking about secret government info. If they put that on the open internet that&#x27;s a serious failure on their part and they&#x27;d have fucked it up with another tool if they weren&#x27;t fucking it up with ES.

            Not much to tell... old forum friend from back when forums were the big thing. We&#x27;d play videogames together that weren&#x27;t too sensitive to lag in our off hours. She had a few stories from life there, I forget what her role was. At one point she got to shake the hand of the president and she showed me a picture of it. We lost touch and I have no idea what she&#x27;s up to now.

            It looks like it was &quot;leaked&quot;, as in, publicly exposed server indexed by a few search engines. It&#x27;s possible that this researcher was the only one to come across it, and reported it immediately. In which case it&#x27;ll never see the light of day.

            &quot;The exposed server was taken down about three weeks later, on August 9, 2021.

            That&#x27;s easy: perverse incentives.<p>1. Secure by default makes for a higher barrier to entry. It&#x27;s human nature to want to keep barriers of entry low for your life&#x27;s work. (I have similar thoughts around copyleft licenses being better for the users but hard to sell to the creators.)<p>2. Security is &quot;available&quot; to anyone savvy enough to clear all the hurdles to secure the system, so the creators feel justified to blame the user.<p>3. The product is developed with an assumption that something <i>outside</i> the product is supposed to provide security. For example, the Go.CD devs (excellent product otherwise) scoffed at the idea of improving their crappy password hashing (single round of SHA256 with no salt IIRC), instead suggesting that I should wrap the service in some other, safer authentication mechanism.

            Think I&#x27;ve posted this before but my employer paid Elastic for the official training - and even that course included everything on how to set up, run and tune ES but applying any security was only covered in the advanced course that you had to pay another $x thousand dollars to attend.<p>So even doing official Elastic training still leaves you with a nice footgun.

            Yeah. &quot;Not leaking data&quot; is basically a pay-for way for Elastic to commercialise the tool. A pretty shitty way, I would say.

            By default, Elasticsearch is unsecured. If you manage your own ES cluster, you have to go through a few steps to secure it manually. Lots of people either don&#x27;t know&#x2F;don&#x27;t care about this though, so they regularly expose their data to the whole internet.

            I have no clue if i&#x27;m on the list. However as an anarchist i believe there are chances i&#x27;m on there, because we anarchists are opposed to all forms of domination and exploitation, so there&#x27;s a lot of people in power who are angry at us. The ancestor of Interpol, the first international conference gathering psychopaths from political police from across the planet in 1898, was famously a conference &quot;for social defense against anarchists&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;International_Conference_of_Rome_for_the_Social_Defense_Against_Anarchists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;International_Conference_of_Ro...</a><p>I have had many friends over the years go through prison and put on &quot;terrorism&quot; lists by the french secret service for their political activities. Government is tyranny. Governments only exist to serve the rich and powerful, and ensure nothing ever changes. If you&#x27;re not convinced, you can look up FBI&#x27;s &quot;COINTELPRO&quot;, of which the current no-fly list program and terrorism-creation program (search for &quot;How the FBI creates terrorists&quot;, plenty of documented cases) are just a continuation of COINTELPRO and other FBI&#x2F;CIA programs designed to prevent the people from exerting their free will and right to organize.

            So are you saying you&#x27;re just guessing because you believe the government has it out to get Trump supporters? If, it turned out, there was a similarly large number of people on the list prior to Trump&#x27;s election, would that change your mind? I think the concern that an extra-judicial list this large certainly has the potential for abuse, and America&#x27;s 3-letter agencies have historically used the auspices of national security to target and harass political opponents and personal enemies. However, you don&#x27;t have any reason to suspect that this list contains that group specifically, right? Other than just some perceived marginalization by mainstream society, that is.
