            I actually mentioned in a thread about Plaid in 2018 that they sold transaction history to third parties, and the cofounder came onto HN to explicitly deny that [1].

            Based on this, and the blog post, they clearly take issue with the term ‘sold’.  Making the users data accessible via api to customers who’ve paid for access to said data does not constitute ‘being sold’, as far as their lawyers are concerned. The fact that 98 million users disagree is unfortunate...<p>The product was sold as infrastructure, and used as data collection, and 98 million users were not aware of that.<p>If you’re unable to reconcile why users of square cash would be confused when they hear their data is accessible through some service called ‘plaid’ for which they’ve never signed up, or given their data, then maybe you could start with defining terms as they would, rather than how you’d prefer they sound.<p>Having data in a database doesn’t make it yours, it’s the users. It was when it was in their bank, it is when you move it to your service and it remains when you provide it to someone else.

            I replied in a few other threads on this. We don&#x27;t make the user&#x27;s data accessible via API outside of the app the user connected. Your personal data is not sold or rented or given away or bartered to parties that are not Plaid, your bank, or the connected app.<p>We talk about all of this in our privacy policy, including ways that data could be used — for example, with data processors&#x2F;service providers (like AWS which hosts our services) for the purposes of running Plaid’s services or for a user’s connected app to provide their services.<p>Here&#x27;s the policy if you want to look: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;#consumers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;#consumers</a>

            I don&#x27;t think the policy helps much. For example,<p>&gt; We share your End User Information for a number of business purposes:<p>&gt; - With the developer of the application you are using and as directed by that developer (such as with another third party if directed by you);<p>&gt; - With our data processors and other service providers, partners, or contractors in connection with the services they perform for us or developers;<p>This is so vague that I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s even supposed to mean. What Plaid lawyers will argue it means when pressed is a further question.

            Thank you for the response — I know you&#x27;re likely very restricted in what you can say here, but:<p>You just settled a claim that you sold customer transaction histories, and from the article linked, the plaintiffs&#x27; lawyers claim that you have agreed to implement meaningful business practice changes to remediate these issues.<p>(1) If you&#x27;ve never sold transaction histories, why settle a lawsuit alleging that you sold transaction histories?<p>(2) What meaningful business practice changes could you be making if there&#x27;s no issue to begin with?<p>(I&#x27;m relying on the article here as a source of truth).

            You’re right that I can’t write much (legal, PR team say hello).<p>The bottom line point is, we don’t sell data and that’s not the main allegation. The main allegation is that people didn’t understand that we were part of the flow of connecting banks to apps. We disagree.<p>Before 2017, there was a whitelabel experience of Plaid that didn’t say “Plaid”, didn’t have the Plaid logo, etc. We still stand by our belief that our disclosures at the time were more than adequate. But it’s not something we want to have protracted litigation around.<p>The reality is that our experience today is vastly different (and has been for a while). As for “what meaningful business practice changes could you be making if there&#x27;s no issue to begin with.” Like most companies, we’re always making improvements to our experience -- today we have a consent pane that makes our role clear, a portal for people to manage their data, etc.

            (IANAL either) I understand and agree that part of the issue is that they, allegedly, underhandedly collected this data.

The lack of banking APIs is the only reason Plaid exists and has to resort to scraping or storing banking information.

            &gt; Oh, also, if people are so terrified of Plaid, they should write to the Congresspeople and ask them to write a bill to force banks to write &amp; provide REST APIs.<p>Why REST? Yes, I’d certainly rather call rest APIs than, say SOAP APIs, but do really want Congress specifying that much technical detail?

            I haven&#x27;t used Plaid and I haven&#x27;t read the litigation, but it seems the following scenario may have happened:<p>1) Users use Plaid to buy&#x2F;sell with a variety of vendors and banks
2) Vendors and banks were aware that specific users were buying &#x2F;selling because they were buying&#x2F;selling their products
3) Users consented to #2 because they were buying&#x2F;selling their products<p>4) Plaid provided aggregated reports that said &quot;5% of your customers also shopped on Amazon&quot;<p>People sued over #4

            I worked at Plaid from when it was less than 50 people to when it was a little over 100.  There was no selling of data going on when I was there in any form (anonymized, aggregated, or otherwise). More generally, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for Plaid to sell data. They already make a huge amount of money on the API. Why jeopardize that? In terms of the settlement size, it actually seems like peanuts to me in comparison to the size of Plaid and the number of affected people. I mean it basically translates into 60 cents a person. This seems more like a payoff to the class action lawyers, enough to make it worth their while but basically nothing for their &quot;clients.&quot;

            Did you pull all transactions on plaid auth requests?  Did you store that data to build out your risk score product?   You’re standard customer(one verifying their account for an ACH pull) more than likely didn’t know all their transactions were being stored and mined.  They just wanted to fund their robinhood account.   That is the issue.

Copy-pasta:<p>No, your personal data is not sold or rented or given away or bartered to parties that are not Plaid, your bank, or the connected app. We talk about all of this in our privacy policy, including ways that data could be used — for example, with data processors&#x2F;service providers (like AWS which hosts our services) for the purposes of running Plaid’s services or for a user’s connected app to provide their services.

            That&#x27;s just not at all true. If you&#x27;ve ever worked in &#x2F; around law you&#x27;d understand how it&#x27;s less about right and wrong and more about risk management.

            A legal settlement over a lawsuit is the epitome of &quot;if legally they are stating things accurately&quot;, how can you possibly conclude that their settlement relates to how you, a mere human, believe the English phrases to be constructed. One explanation is dismissed because it touches on supposedly irrelevant legal details yet your belief is based entirely on another legal detail. It sounds like you&#x27;ve made up your mind already regardless of what the &quot;plain English&quot; circumstances could be.

            I&#x27;m betting you are right. It may be that they sold aggregated data, and that they aggregated based on factors that might have been <i>too</i> granular in some situations.<p>Perhaps something like &quot;all users who are in the UK and logged in last Sunday morning&quot;. Something like that could have been a pain to sess out for each instance of data sharing, in addition, if you &quot;settle in court&quot;, you can also set court-approved definitions of what &quot;anonymously aggregated&quot; means.

            I see a lot of suspicion in thread below, which I very much understand.<p>I&#x27;d like to take a minute though to express my frustration with the banks that refuse to supply any sort of limited APIs. How is it 2021 and I still can&#x27;t give my tax person read only access to a specific year of transactions? Plaid and others trust issue would be so much easier if the banks had any sort of control over sharing aside from none or authorized to do anything.

            No, your personal data is not sold or rented or given away or bartered to parties that are not Plaid, your bank, or the connected app. We talk about all of this in our privacy policy, including ways that data could be used — for example, with data processors&#x2F;service providers (like AWS which hosts our services) for the purposes of running Plaid’s services or for a user’s connected app to provide their services.

            I don&#x27;t understand something. Please, help me understand:<p>&quot;According to the lawsuit, filed Thursday in California federal court, the plaintiffs alleged that Plaid has “exploited its position as middleman” to obtain app users’ banking login credentials and use that information to gain access to and sell their transaction histories. Allegedly, these actions occurred without users knowing about Plaid’s role is a variance of “deceptive tactics.”&quot;<p>So, the lawsuit is for selling the transaction histories and you say you never did it.<p>Why do you settle for $58M if you never did it rather than go to court so that they present proofs that, according to your explanation, must be false?<p>I am not convinced.<p>Or, the simpler explanation you just lie here to us because you can.

            While I have you here, as a developer of a financial product myself and wanting to use something to let my users connect their bank accounts to my product via plaid, let me tell you sir that your pricing strategy sucks. There is no way for a developer to pay for plaid use on per user basis and your service cannot be used without having to pay like minimum $500 to you every month even if I have like 10 users. So basically your pricing is hostile towards startups.

            Sorry you got hit by that! I work at Plaid -- most of Plaid&#x27;s APIs can be used without a $500 monthly minimum contract but a few of them do require it -- we know this is a pain point and are currently looking into how can make pricing on these products friendlier to small developers.

            The cofounder was telling the truth (or, at least, nothing in the lawsuit implies that he was not).<p>The plaintiffs in this case are claiming that when they linked their bank accounts to PayPal&#x2F;Venmo&#x2F;etc using Plaid they didn&#x27;t realize what they were doing, or that it&#x27;s somehow unfair that Paypal&#x2F;Venmo&#x2F;etc got their banking data (despite knowingly inputting their credentials into Paypal&#x2F;Venmo&#x2F;etc).<p>Paypal&#x2F;Venmo&#x2F;etc is not a third party in that case.

            The &quot;using Plaid&quot; part of what you&#x27;re saying confuses me. My reading is that the plaintiffs are claiming that they signed up for Paypal or Venmo directly, linked their banks account, and were unaware that behind the scenes this meant their data went to Plaid, and that then Plaid both gathered data from this and sold the data.<p>If that&#x27;s accurate - if the plaintiffs were just trying to use Paypal + their bank account, and only coincidentally using Plaid because Paypal used Plaid - then any data being captured and stored by Plaid does sound extremely fishy. I&#x27;d want them to just be a bridge to let info flow between the bank and Paypal, not store any of that themselves too. That part seems sketchy even if they never sold it - I still don&#x27;t think they should keep it in the first place.

Here&#x27;s the suit: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classaction.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;cottle-et-al-v-plaid-inc.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classaction.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;cottle-et-al-v-plaid-inc.p...</a>.<p>The relevant section is on pg 16, under the heading &quot;Plaid Sells and Otherwise Exploits the Unlawfully-Obtained Private Data&quot;.<p>The suit alleges that &quot;Plaid has admitted that it routinely sells the consumer banking data it collects. At a minimum, Plaid sells the data it obtains from consumers’ accounts back to the very app providers,
including the Participating Apps, who use its services. [40] Plaid calibrates its prices based on the
type of information being sold. [41]&quot;.<p>Footnotes 40 and 41 are, respectively:<p>[40] See Feb. 21, 2017 Response by Plaid to CFPB’s RFI, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;PlaidConsumer-Data-Access-RFI-Technical-Policy-Response.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;PlaidConsumer-Data-Access-RFI-Te...</a> (Plaid acknowledges to CFPB that it
sells data to party “permissioned” by consumer).<p>[41] See Feb. 2019 interview with Zach Perret, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.saastr.com&#x2F;build-a-platformecosystem&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.saastr.com&#x2F;build-a-platformecosystem&#x2F;</a>.<p>-----<p>IANAL. The suit alleges that Plaid sells the data, with the specific proof that Plaid sells data to the authorized app (Paypal or Venmo in your example above). The plaintiffs do provide proof in the suit that Plaid sells the data to third parties, but suggest that Plaid might, since they already sell the data to the app that users authorized.<p>At risk of misrepresenting their argument, the suit seems to claim that Plaid doesn&#x27;t do enough to give consumers (think average non-tech savvy person) enough of a heads up on what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes. According to the suit, a consumer using Plaid doesn&#x27;t understand that they give banking credentials to a third party (Plaid), which uses the credentials and &quot;sells&quot; data to the app that is being connected to the bank.<p>The above seems consistent to what the Plaid CTO wrote. I haven&#x27;t seen anything that indicates Plaid sells your data to unrelated third parties. That said, I agree with the suit - Plaid should do a better job of making it clear exactly how your banking information is going to be used.

            So, in other words, they&#x27;re selling my data, just not to third parties.

            &gt;<i>then any data being captured and stored by Plaid does sound extremely fishy</i><p>I&#x27;ve integrated with Plaid&#x27;s API (a long time ago), and this doesn&#x27;t sound fishy. Plaid&#x27;s API is pretty comprehensive and it would have PayPal&#x27;s job to unlink the connection after the verification took place. Plaid gives you a &quot;token&quot; representing the user that can be used to further look up information in their account - such as new transactions. If PayPal had naively enabled the usage of those APIs, then it&#x27;s not surprising Plaid stored that data.<p>For example, if you (the API client) didn&#x27;t want to store <i>any</i> information except for a user token (similar how you might store tokens with Stripe&#x27;s API), then every time you needed to lookup the client&#x27;s account number you would call Plaid&#x27;s API to retrieve that data (which, by definition, they would be storing).

            As a customer, though, that still sounds very dismaying to me.<p>If I&#x27;m linking my bank to paypal to send money back and forth, I don&#x27;t want: (a) paypal getting transaction history, (b) a third party company hanging on to those credentials, (c) that third party company getting any view of transactions either.

Nobody &quot;using&quot; Plaid is intended to give this intermediary company all that info.<p>I&#x27;m linking my account to Paypal because I (thought that) I trusted Paypal. I never knew I was actually giving all this shit to this other company too.<p>(In my case, I&#x27;ve used routing number&#x2F;checking number because they seemed to require handing over less privileges than my full password, and this certainly seems to reinforce my skepticism about using the &quot;sign in to your bank&quot; password auth for linkage.)

That said, even though I don&#x27;t believe Plaid sold any data, a lot of people brought this up as a concern to using Plaid. I don&#x27;t consider it shady behavior, because I don&#x27;t think Plaid ever misrepresented their capabilities to their clients. In other words, PayPal <i>knew</i> Plaid would be storing this data, and used their reputation to provide legitimacy to Plaid. In my opinion, it was PayPal who was irresponsible with your data.

It suggests that Plaid might sell the data to unrelated third parties, but doesn&#x27;t support it with any proof. It does support itself with proof that Plaid &quot;sells&quot; data to the app that is being connected to the bank.

            Wow what a jerk.

            It is particularly sad how common scenarios this are for users, especially in the US. I have known how terrible applications like Plaid (and alternatives) were, but at various points have been required to use them to do something like pay my rent (this is also a very common theme in my life: I strongly dislike a certain company or app, but find myself required to use them regardless, even knowing that my usage and information will be abused).<p>Giving my full credentials <i>and my security question answer</i> in plaintext to a third party in order to &#x27;link my bank accounts&#x27;, and then having them scrape every bit of information they can from my personal banking statements and sell it is... nothing short of a nightmare scenario, from many standpoints (user security, user privacy, user education, anti-phishing, and so on).<p>I guess it&#x27;s nice to see this class-action lawsuit, but that it amounts to an average of $0.60 per affected user is, well, not particularly inspiring with respect to my hope that things will ever get better here.<p>Plaid is used by many industry leaders including Venmo, Robinhood, and Coinbase. When it&#x27;s not used, usually a similar alternative is. Perhaps the most frustrating part of this is that placing blame on these companies is difficult, as there&#x27;s no interoperability or open banking APIs that can be used as an alternative.

            I disagree somewhat to this - it&#x27;s certainly true to an extent but when it comes to gross negligence or malicious intent most of the world will seriously come down on you.

            Isn&#x27;t giving your credentials to a third party also a violation of the terms of service with your bank? It seems, at the very least, the bank will just tell you &quot;too bad&quot; if there&#x27;s a breach and someone drains your bank account using the credentials you gave Plaid.

            I just read the settlement document, and it looks like this is being reported incorrectly or at least ambiguously.<p>The allegation is NOT that they shared&#x2F;sold data to any third parties but that their Plaid Link user interface, where people enter their banking information to add it to Plaid, looks like the customer&#x27;s financial institution (i.e, uses the bank&#x27;s branding colours and logo).<p>Because of this branding, people can reasonably assume that they are sending that data directly to their bank without knowledge, and therefore consent, to share their information with Plaid itself.<p>If that understanding is correct then this isn&#x27;t a business practice or security issue, but a user consent issue. That&#x27;s a problem that definitely needs to be fixed, and the injunctive relief requires them to change the branding and disclosure to make it clearer that people are interacting with Plaid rather than their bank.<p>But to me it&#x27;s definitely not a reason to cancel your account or boycott Plaid or whatever.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newmedialaw.proskauer.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;22&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;Plaid-Memorandum-of-Points-for-Prelimary-Settlement.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newmedialaw.proskauer.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;2...</a>

            +1. Bad reporting here. This seems to be mostly about consumer disclosure, not that what&#x27;s happening under-the-hood is different that what your average security-conscious developer might expect after reading that Plaid doesn&#x27;t sell your data.<p>That said I think the suit makes a compelling argument that the disclosures should be better.

            Looks like there is some other deceptive stuff going on as well - for example, they apparently collected and stored transaction data even when developers didnt request it (at least, they are agreeing to delete this data now, so it must have been collected in some cases).

            Again, I don&#x27;t see anything shady there. There&#x27;s two things I see in the settlement about that:<p>1. They proactively retrieved transaction data when you connect an account. This sounds like an assumption that almost always people are going to want transaction data, so they just do it by default, presumably to improve the first-time user experience so the data&#x27;s already there when you later request it. This is going to be changed to only retrieve transaction data on demand.<p>2. If Plaid&#x27;s connection is broken (e.g. the user changes their password) then Plaid deactivates the connection but keeps the data. They&#x27;ve agreed to delete the data in this case. The drawback of this change is that since many connectivity issues are going to be temporary, this means that in those cases they&#x27;ll need to delete the data, then retrieve it again when the user reconnects.<p>Basically it sounds like they optimized a little too hard on user experience, especially when connecting a new account, and in the process they overstepped user consent. I don&#x27;t see any bad intent there personally, it sounds like they were just a bit overzealous trying to make the experience super slick.

            The UK and EU have both adopted effectively what you describe under PSD2 - the UK banks in particular were forced by their competition and markets regulator (CMA) to adopt open interoperable APIs.<p>The end result, now it&#x27;s available, is that you have 2 levels of API access. One is for access to account information (I tend to think of this as read-only access), and the other is to allow for &quot;payment initiation&quot; (think of it as write access, although not a perfect analogy).<p>An account information service provider (AISP) can do things like aggregate bank accounts into one view, across different banks. A payment service initiation provider (PISP) can create payment gateways and initiate payments against a bank account using an authenticated session (enabling direct bank payment online, without needing a debit or credit card and the associated infrastructure around that).<p>You can&#x27;t just rock up and access the APIs though - I believe you need to get your application approved and engage with the regulator, which is probably for the better, to avoid the &quot;app store problem&quot; of loads of apps springing up in the API ecosystem, asking for permission, then just leeching data to third parties after you apparently consent on page 46 of their terms.

            It&#x27;s a vacuum that encourages banks to continue sabotaging, foot dragging, and target moving.<p>The result is middle apps that are forced to use sketchy anti-patterns like screen scraping and asking for user&#x2F;pass instead of each bank issuing a per-app token. The banks are just fine with this because anything that explodes will be the middle app&#x27;s fault and they want to preserve their otherwise moatless situation. Consumers can&#x27;t really tell banks apart so they have to force retention.

            The problem isn&#x27;t banks not having APIs, the problem is not having standard APIs for accessing them. The situation wouldn&#x27;t be any better if every bank had its own proprietary API, hence why Plaid exists.

            The situation <i>would</i> be better than it is now, even with every bank implementing their own proprietary API. As it is now, the APIs may or may not exist - and a lot of times the fall-back for these services is web-scraping, using the same <i>full access</i> credentials the user has to use to log in otherwise. It&#x27;s a security nightmare and it&#x27;s fragile.<p>At least if the bank implements some sort of API that means some thought was probably given toward using tokens instead username&#x2F;password, and some thought was given toward scoping the APIs - at least into read-only and read-write capable access.<p>Although if you read between the lines in some of the service descriptions and backend documentation, a lot of what Plaid (and Yodlee, and others) do is now a mix of scraping and private APIs the banks provide, but those APIs are only available to commercial entities they&#x27;ve signed a relationship with.<p>Obviously the ideal is public standardized APIs all banks provide with established security-focused practices and read-only limited data access as an option. But proprietary per-bank APIs available to the general public would be a good step forward.

            This recently happened to me as well - Venmo tried to invalidate my payment method and pushed me to go through their &quot;instant verification&quot; process. Note that &quot;manual verification&quot; (i.e. the deposit method) is still an option on their app, though you may have to remove your current bank credentials and re-add it.

            I think companies should still provide a way to link accounts via small deposits.  It takes a few days, but at least you don&#x27;t have to share your credentials.

Based in large part on the success of Plaid, this is starting to change; some institutions are banning Plaid from using the password-based flow, and are replacing this with a more secure OAuth flow:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;link&#x2F;oauth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;link&#x2F;oauth&#x2F;</a><p>This is the correct solution to the technical problem at hand. It&#x27;ll benefit other systems too; for example it should be possible for open-source accounting software to use this flow to export your transaction history in a maintainable way, which previously relied on scraping that&#x27;s unfeasible for an OSS project to keep up with (but which Mint could afford to implement).<p>Hopefully the banks let you selectively grant permissions &quot;can view my account list&quot; and &quot;can view my transaction list&quot;, or at least surface those permissions, so that consumers can be aware of what they are giving away -- I&#x27;d wager that most end users have no idea that Plaid is slurping their transaction history, and would be even more shocked that it&#x27;s maintaining ongoing access to continue doing the same.

            I did this recently (well not all my data, but one bank account). I had to go through customer support, and they had some trouble with it but eventually figured it out.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of Plaid. The core concept is great, but training users to enter credentials (much less <i>banking</i> credentials) into third-party sites is nuts. Nowadays, it would be easy for someone to pivot from a compromise of a random company&#x27;s web server to impersonating Plaid and pwning most of their customers&#x27; bank accounts.<p>This would be trivial to fix by deprecating their current UI and switching to a small popup or redirecting to a different URL.

            I&#x27;m a bit confused reading this. Is the lawsuit that users signing up for e.g. Venmo didn&#x27;t know that they were also giving their transaction history&#x2F;whatever to Venmo, or that Plaid was then taking the data passed to Venmo and reselling to, I don&#x27;t know, a hedge fund?<p>If it&#x27;s the former -- I certainly think services need to clearly state what&#x2F;why&#x2F;how they are using the data, but it&#x27;s on the services (like Venmo) and not Plaid.

            Personally, services that ask for your bank account credentials are a “no go” for me. The passwords themselves are likely stored securely, but the fact they are stored at all is concerning.<p>All it takes is a bad actor within the company to re-write the screen scraping to then impersonate the users and have them wire out money to a foreign bank account. Some anti-fraud systems might catch this activity but for people that use the wire system on a frequent basis it might go unnoticed.<p>Or they may screen scrape the information and sell it on the black market. Wouldn’t be too hard to target a specific group (elderly, retired) since you already have their bank credentials which subsequently has reliable&#x2F;verified demographic information and account balances.
