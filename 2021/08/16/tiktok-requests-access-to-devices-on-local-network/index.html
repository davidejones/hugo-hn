            Consent is tricky. Many people are not aware of what they are giving authorization to. That would make it uninformed consent. Add dark patterns in and I think it is easy to say that some people are not only unaware of what they are authorizing, but purposefully being misled.<p>Let&#x27;s be real, most people are tech illiterate. If someone can&#x27;t read a contract and there is no one there to explain it to them, then they are not engaging in informed consent.<p>Of course we have to ask if this is ethical or not. But let&#x27;s not boil the conversation down to &quot;we asked, so it is right.&quot; One side is arguing that the person didn&#x27;t give informed consent and the other side is arguing that consent was given simply because a button was pressed.<p>It&#x27;s honestly an ethical discussion of if this is right or not.

            Is this separate from mDNS [1]?

            Many common wifi APs (eg TP-link EAP225) will allow you to create separate wifi networks on different VLANs. You can use this to isolate internet of shit devices onto their own networks where they can’t talk to your other devices, without increasing your hardware costs or causing wifi interference.<p>You’ll need a router&#x2F;firewall and an AP that are both VLAN-aware. I personally use an EAP225 and some eBay industrial PC running freebsd.

            Interesting! That&#x27;s not how I read the ublock origin docs:<p>&quot;Keep in mind that this feature is to prevent leakage of your non-internet-facing IP adresses.

            You can, on a rooted phone. There&#x27;s ways to install a CA certificate with root (described in my only popular blog post) but there&#x27;s also alternatives, like using Frida to disable TLS verification all together.<p>It&#x27;s certainly not as easy and reliable as it used to be, but it&#x27;s still common for security research to use these tactics to see what apps are doing.

            The basis of many enterprise networks is device-installed CAs so I would be thoroughly surprised. iOS at least still allows you to install a custom CA and only a few apps will refuse to work with it, who likely reject connections that aren&#x27;t secured via a specific CA.

            There is also another cool feature of moderns phones - updates. Unless a corporation can prove that each and every single release and test version in the past and the future didn&#x27;t and will not do something, then it is always possible that some versions did this or will be doing in the future.

            Everything TikTok is usually linked to malice and espionage from China. If this is a common industry practice at the very least you give it the benefit of the doubt. It doesn&#x27;t make it ok. It just makes it not automatically linked to international cyber warfare.

            The incidents that might qualify as cyber warfare could also just be looked at as the same struggle for power on a different front, compared to economics. It can&#x27;t be lost on Chinese leaders how valuable it is to the US to have so much money and data flowing through its domestic tech companies. Tech companies can&#x27;t cross the line into cyber warfare themselves and get a pass on it, but they do play a role in it.

            afaik apps can detect patterns on the pasteboard without triggering the notification (i.e. check if the URL is a TikTok URL or not), but they can&#x27;t actually access the contents without triggering the notification. it&#x27;s enforced by the pasteboard API on iOS.<p>so they probably updated their apps to perform this check before doing anything.

            Some other apps (Signal?) have also done this out of the blue, though they may have since added a UI around this.<p>Regardless, Apple has done the right thing by putting this behind a permissions box, but the developer should be required to have some sort of explanation string of why they need this.

            That thing makes it annoying for the kind of applications my company does, that needs to communicate with other devices on the local network.<p>It&#x27;s annoying because it&#x27;s not like other permissions, where you can ask the OS to prompt the user, and check if the user granted it or not, but it&#x27;s some special permission. If the user, by mistake because it doesn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s needed, doesn&#x27;t give it one time it&#x27;s impossible to ask again, and the app doesn&#x27;t have a way to know that the permission is not granted. It&#x27;s just things that the customer service has to handle, and that is bad.<p>Sure, right to ask a permission, so make it like a regular permission as the location permission.

            &gt; It&#x27;s annoying because it&#x27;s not like other permissions<p>Normally if I want to use a permission, say location, I need to provide a value for given permission in my app&#x27;s `info.plist` file, and if I don&#x27;t and the app tries to grab the current location, it crashes with logs yelling at me to provide a description for the location privacy key.<p>With local network permissions it&#x27;s different.<p>I&#x27;ve never had to do any local networking in my career as an iOS dev so downloaded Apple&#x27;s peer to peer example app (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;network&#x2F;building_a_custom_peer-to-peer_protocol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;network&#x2F;building_a...</a>) and removed the `Privacy - Local Network Usage Description` key&#x2F;value pair from the `info.plist` file and ran the app on my device.<p>I fully expected a crash with a description telling me to add this key but iOS just filled in the missing description with a default value and asked away.

            The simplest take on the concept is get a 3rd party with a public address to exchange the current port tuples used to connect to it between the 2 clients so the clients can then use this information to connect directly.<p>Beyond the basic take on it there really isn&#x27;t an intuitive single explanation because &quot;simple&quot; things like &quot;NAT traversal&quot; quickly turn into &quot;Full-cone NAT to Port-restricted NAT with UPnP behind CG-NAT&quot; individual corner cases endlessly fighting the need to just go to IPv6.

            For some technical context: this dialog pops up the first time an app attempts to send a packet to a local device. A &quot;common&quot; reason why this happens are actually your own network devices if you&#x27;re connected on wifi.  For instance sending a custom DNS query to the wifi advertised DNS server (if it&#x27;s the router) will cause that dialog. Same thing happens if you happen to have a router redirect certain resources to itself.  The latter typically at this point only happens for non encrypted HTTP traffic and that&#x27;s basically no longer permitted.<p>So why it happens exactly would be interesting.

            More context, especially resolving link-local DNS names (those ending with local, per RFC 6762) requires local network access. For iOS devices, Apple has summed this pretty well[1]. Yes, if permission required on below:<p><pre><code>    Making an outgoing TCP connection — yes

    Listening for and accepting incoming TCP connections — no

    Sending a UDP unicast — yes

    Sending a UDP multicast — yes

    Sending a UDP broadcast — yes

    Receiving an incoming UDP unicast — no

    Receiving an incoming UDP multicast — yes

    Receiving an incoming UDP broadcast — yes

    And finally usage of Bonjour operations.

            This sounds like it might help against DNS rebinding attacks, — at the cost of breaking interchangeability between DNS names and IP addresses.<p>Not sure, if such policy is a good idea, especially if the permission prompt automatically appears upon network activity without explicit developer intention. This will simply condition users to click &quot;OK&quot; without understanding what&#x27;s going on.

            I‘ve had many apps, even very trustworthy ones, show me this permission prompt when my internet connection was down and the router was directing all requests to an error page. So it‘s possible for this prompt to appear without the app developer doing anything bad. Not giving TikTok much benefit of doubt though.

            I am not sure under which circumstances it flags. If you write your own DNS client for sure it will happen, but there seem to be more things that cause this to trigger.<p>After that dialog was introduced I saw it pop up on stack overflow for some relatively common libraries (for instance with unity) even if they did not attempt to access the local network.

            Interesting. I initially denied the permission, but Tiktok seemed to not be able to make any Internet requests. The kind of behavior I would expect if DNS didn’t work anymore.<p>Maybe it’s just as innocent as this, but OTOH, it’s tiktok we’re talking about.

            Any discussion of intent is always going to be speculation. All we can think about is what such a thing would be capable of if it were somehow malicious.<p>The first possibility that comes to my mind would be sniffing Ethernet MAC addresses because it could be done without any sort of device-specific support built in to the app. Assuming your local devices’ manufacturers are following Da Rulez, the first part of their MAC address usually tells you the company, and the second part tends to be individualized&#x2F;serialized.<p>That would, for example, let TikTok derive when certain users are together IRL if they both show up scan-adjacent to a unique MAC. Or maybe it could let them derive multiple accounts belonging to a single person if one is used on VPN-only to discuss political or personal topics that person might not want associated with their IRL identity.

            If I was a state intelligence service I would <i>love</i> TikTok. Especially if it was legally banned in my country so was used almost exclusively by foreigners.

Then using the app to collect and exfiltrate information about all manner of foreign networks.

            The only actual issue with this setup for citizens of the US is that US citizens like to be the people with access to the data and doing the spying. What you have described, a state intelligence service with access to loads of user data that they happily use for spying is what the US has normalized. Collecting all this data is par for the course (Snowden exposed that pretty conclusively) and non US citizens have no rights as far as the US is concerned. Are they (china) doing it, probably not, seems like a lot of effort for very little gain I mean you find out that I like puppy videos and mostly stay in my house. It&#x27;s a fun app though :) - also to the original person&#x27;s tweet, most of the apps on my iphone pop this up from time to time, so if we are going to accuse TikTok of spying on me we should be accusing Calm and Insight Timer too (to randomly pick two).

            AFAIK Calm and Insight don&#x27;t have hundreds of millions of users nor is the CCP on their corporate boards. But with explanations provided by the apps as to why they want network device access they probably <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be trusted.<p>As for the data collection, TikTok&#x2F;ByteDance is definitely going to store it. They wouldn&#x27;t collect it otherwise. To the utility of the data, if they&#x27;ve got MAC addresses of devices on your home network they can tell many of the brands of devices you own. They know when you get a new computer even if you never use TikTok on it. If you launch the app at your office they get the same information about your office network. In aggregate their network scanning will collect vast amounts of data.<p>The TikTok app is turning every user into a passive network scanner. Even if you want to ignore the CCP&#x27;s influence on ByteDance I don&#x27;t think there is any reason to give them the benefit of the doubt about their data collection. They&#x27;ll sell their users and anyone around them. I have the same problem with Facebook and their damn shadow profiles and covert data collection.

            My point is that this just appears to be xenophobia and is completely hypocritical. Nearly every app on my phone asks to access the local network.It&#x27;s a thing. It&#x27;s not unusual in the slightest. The problem seems to be that this company is based in China. And we don&#x27;t like China. Maybe that is not what you in particular don&#x27;t like (I get that you don&#x27;t like FB) but that is the reason why this is a topic conversation at all. So in effect what the people in this thread are saying is that American companies (and by direct link the US gov) are allowed to spy on people, but foreign governments should not be allowed. That seems like a huge double standard. For the record, I personally would prefer no governments were spying on me - but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be on the table.

            &gt; The problem seems to be that this company is based in China.<p>You&#x27;re misrepresenting the situation because you want to frame the whole issue as some xenophobia on my part. The problem is TikTok is a social network with millions of users whose parent company <i>literally</i> has the CCP as a board member and is subject to China&#x27;s extremely invasive state security laws (requiring warrantless access to corporate data). The app was already an intelligence gold mine and now they&#x27;ve added a vein of platinum.<p>The only double standard is contained within the strawman you&#x27;ve created. I have the same problem with Facebook or Twitter apps scanning my local network for no reason than to increase their data harvesting. But since TikTok is the <i>subject of the thread</i> I specifically pointed out problems <i>with TikTok</i>. Facebook and Twitter have their own problems, some of them overlap with problems that exist with TikTok.<p>Neither I or anyone else needs to list the myriad problems with every social network when criticizing any one of them.

            But devices would join and leave the network in a household - especially phones. Maybe you could have a listening period, e.g. a week, where you build a set of witnessed devices and then hash that for a household id?

            Of course you can. Look up VPN routing &#x2F; split tunneling. It’s not uncommon for corporate VPNs to only route intranet traffic for instance; and LAN is usually whitelisted.

            Besides corporate VPNs, typical consumer VPNs are also set up to allow LAN access.   Your average joe-smoe would be annoyed if their network printer stopped working every time they turned on their VPN to watch netflix movies or whatever.

            IPSEC VPNs (and others) have the remote networks defined in the protocol as part of the security association (SA). The SAs define which networks are available over the tunnel.<p>Saying &quot;all RFC1918 addresses are available over here&quot; is quite a cocky and obviously broken thing to do, unless you&#x27;re dealing with a corporate device which is paranoid about leaking traffic to other networks.

            That could also explain why they didn&#x27;t bother to provide in the notification to the user <i>why</i> they&#x27;re requesting this access: because they weren&#x27;t intending to request it (yet).<p>I find the conspiracy theories more compelling, but less likely.

            I assumed it was to gracefully deal with handoff from one device to another while in a meeting since you can start on one device and continue with another, or maybe to share your screen from another device etc. It would be nice to know why exactly certain permissions are requested; sometimes that’s done by telling you what feature it might break if you don’t grant those permissions.

            That&#x27;s a great observation - for handoff it would make much more sense to get the permission beforehand, rather than trying to stop all sorts of a&#x2F;v and network processes to get the user&#x27;s ok.

            For MS I suspect either incompetence or laziness and just checking all the permissions (because a lot of Teams seems poorly thought out and designed by committee, probably an “agile” one too).<p>As for Tick Tock it’s obviously spyware meant for direct user identification. How anyone can use it when it’s uploading their biometric information (face, voice) to the CCP is beyond stupidity.

            So far from what I’ve seen, it is mostly along the lines of “they technically can, so I assume they do.”<p>Even when it comes to someone like me, who is very strongly anti-CCP, it definitely irks me a bit. Mostly because making strong accusations like that without any reasoning other than “they can, so they definitely do it” only makes that position look weaker and more difficult to align with. Why make up those things and accusations, when there are so many other valid points for criticism there? There is a reason for why “the boy who cried wolf” is a very commonly referenced parable.

            &gt; Chromecasting<p>IMHO the OS or some common proxy app should take care of this. Yes, Chromecasting is a legitimate case and it&#x27;s nice of TikTok or any other relevant app to offer such a feature but I don&#x27;t trust random (let alone Chinese) app vendors to scan my home network.

            Pokéball Plus support. I mean, I can’t speak to Niantic fingerprinting players because I don’t know if they are, but you do need Bluetooth to use the Pokéball Plus properly. Also I believe you need Bluetooth to work with the Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee games on the Switch to transfer Pokémon back and forth, but I never did get that to work properly.

            Yeah, but Let&#x27;s Go and Pokeball were released years ago.  Go Plus was released almost Day 1, if I recall.  All of those connect via Bluetooth and never required a network.  They all still work just fine if you deny PoGo the permission to access devices.

            Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t this the same dialog that pops up for Bluetooth devices or am I missing something?<p>I haven’t used my Pokeball Plus since about a month after I bought it, which was basically day or week 1, but if I recall correctly the mandate to ask for permissions only came around after that time frame and I would expect it the next time I pulled it out.<p>But if it does work without Bluetooth permissions; then that’s cool, or if this is a separate dialog than the Bluetooth permissions dialog, then I’m just wrong which is also fine and I can live with that.

            No, it&#x27;s definitely different.   The Bluetooth permissions come up whenever you pair a new Pokeball&#x2F;Go Plus&#x2F;3rd Party Device like Gotcha.  It strictly asks if you want to pair a new Bluetooth device.<p>The network discovery is different.  iOS will popup a dialog saying something like, &quot;Pokemon Go wants to discover other devices on your network&quot; or something like that, which is what this story is about.  I believe it pops up once when you install and sign up, but then it never asks again.

            Because that’s how &lt;insert app&gt; is used. The concept of apps and web sites being separate things, or being different, or preferable to one another isn’t on the radar of 95% of people, it’s a blurry shapeless vagueness the mind glazes over if it’s ever forced into recognizing its existence, and immediately discarded afterwards.<p>You’re asking a forum of power users&#x2F;creators, where a loud minority completely unironically still use desktop &amp; laptop computers for activities besides work. The only people on earth less understanding (intentionally or not) of consumer behavior are the Sentinelese.

            I think it&#x27;s very unlikely that Tiktok could build an equivalent UX that would work in a browser, including the creators tools. And even if they could - have they done so?<p>And let&#x27;s not forget that Apple actively works against this way of working by intentionally gimping their browser capabilities and outright disallowing competing browsers.

            For IG the web site pales in comparison. I don&#x27;t use the app but I have an account courtesy FB I think and all the recommendations are &quot;Instagram recommended&quot; accounts like pop singers and reality TV stars even after I followed some that weren&#x27;t such as in real world friends and family. There&#x27;s no way to discover other interesting material. So I guess it&#x27;s because the web version can be much worse.

            On mobile they heavily push people to the app... this is the answer to most &quot;just use the website&quot; questions. Reddit mobile has been particularly bad about this lately, by blocking content. Instagram hits you with a login gate after viewing a few photos, etc... all of these companies are pushing their users to the place where they can siphon off the most data, which at the moment are apps.

            Why does TikTok &#x27;need&#x27; access to devices on your local network?<p>The intention from YouTube is obvious as they use it for Chromecast, but why does TikTok need this particular access? Have they disclosed this usage somewhere?<p>On top of that and continuing from [0], it seems that it is collecting even more things that you may not even know about [0]. Far worse than the other apps out there.<p>The purpose? The recommendation algorithm, of course. Otherwise, how else is it supposed to work?<p>To Downvoters: Lots of commenters here saying that TikTok does not support AirPlay or Chromecast. Since that can be ruled out, what is the intention of this permission and is it disclosed anywhere on why do they need such access?<p>I&#x27;m also assuming that you know why TikTok needs access to devices on your local network?
