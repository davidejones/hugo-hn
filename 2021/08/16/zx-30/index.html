            First impression is that I wouldn&#x27;t go near it until it settles down a bit — it was on v1.7 in May and now on version 3 already.<p>Great that it&#x27;s under active development, but changes to my scripts are infrequent and slow. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be touching an old script on a server somewhere saying &quot;How do I do X in ZX again?&quot; and everything I find online is now for v15 while I&#x27;m still on v3.<p>Maybe if it had plans around a LTS version I&#x27;d take a look at that stage.<p>To be honest though I like doing things in bash. You can get pretty far &amp; it&#x27;s 100% portable. If something&#x27;s too complicated for bash it&#x27;s probably time it&#x27;s not just a simple CLI script anymore, in my experience.

            If you wrote your script against v1.7 and now they&#x27;re on v3, you can still run your script. The v1.7 source and binary haven&#x27;t disappeared. It&#x27;s still available and work exactly the same as when you wrote your script.

            The major version bumps imply breaking changes. Two major versions within a few months implies I might have to refactor my code every couple of months to stay up to date, or face a buildup of tech debt if I want to take advantage of a new feature in the future.<p>If there are no breaking changes, then I would feel better if they called it v1.9.

            As annoying as having to write &quot;await&quot; in front of everything is (probably should have a variant of $ that&#x27;s synchronous), the ability to effortlessly implement parallelism is something that all other common scripting (and many &quot;full&quot;) languages seem to lack.<p>Even Go, that prides itself on the good support for parallelism, fails once you actually want go get results back.<p>If this were paired with some way to also display the status&#x2F;output of multiple commands in parallel, this would be the ultimate toolkit to write scripts.<p>If you look at apt, for example: Does it really have to wait for the last package to be downloaded before installing the first? Is there a good reason, on modern SSD-based computers, to not parallelize the installation of multiple packages that don&#x27;t depend on each other?

            &gt; Even Go, that prides itself on the good support for parallelism, fails once you actually want go get results back.<p>It&#x27;s doable if you&#x27;re willing to build a very thin abstraction over whatever you&#x27;re trying to parallelize keeping in mind all possible edgecases [1] and how you&#x27;d like to handle them.<p>A generic `run N things in parallel and collect their results` function would be nice, but would probably end up being quite unwieldy in comparison to just writing out a purpose-specific function for what you exactly need.<p>[1] - Error handling, timeouts&#x2F;cancellation, maximum amount of processes running in parallel, wait-for-full-join vs. returning results as they appear, introspection of currently running subordinates, subordinate output streaming&#x2F;buffering&#x2F;logging, ... A lot of things to consider when you&#x27;re trying to build something universal, but that are easy to solve&#x2F;ignore when you&#x27;re building something purpose-specific with known constraints.

            That&#x27;s the thing though... if the options are &quot;write and test 30 lines of custom parallelism code to handle this stuff&quot; or &quot;everyone waits twice as long for their results&quot;, in practice most developers choose the latter.<p>Imagine if instead of that, you could do:<p><pre><code>    foo, bar, []err := await getFoo(), getBar()
    if len(err) &gt; 0 {
      return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;Frobnication failed: %s&quot;, err)
    }
    return foo, bar, nil
</code></pre>
Of course, JavaScript having exceptions as the main error-raising approach and `await` supporting them makes that a lot easier.

            I haven&#x27;t looked into Zx yet, but at least for JavaScript that &quot;what color is your function&quot; article also applied before they added the syntactic sugar. If your function was async via a direct callback then the calling function would have to accept a callback too.

            Given Promises and callbacks have always been pervasive in JS—that it’s always been heavily asynchronous—I can’t imagine thinking async&#x2F;await was a mistake. It’s a drastic ergonomic improvement over both, and it also drastically improves debugging and error stacks.<p>Adding it to a language where IO is typically blocking with other ergonomic concurrency mechanisms, that I can imagine being somewhat controversial.<p>It would be good if async weren’t infectious, but as a sibling comment said that was already the case with Promises and callbacks.<p>It would maybe also be better if concurrency was the default behavior and keeping a reference to a promise was the explicit syntax, but I could see downsides to that. It potentially hides&#x2F;encourages excessive use of expensive calls. And implicit concurrency is a potential source of many bugs.

            Those are small examples but for more complex scripts I expect you&#x27;d mostly have synchronous code, for example to process strings, validate input, etc. and the &quot;await&quot; will become the exception rather than the norm.

            In my first job I gave a try at using Python for scripts.<p>It was a terrible idea, as I now had 3 problems instead of 1:<p>1 - Writing scripts, plus:<p>2 - Installing Python in every host that needed to run those scripts<p>3 - Maintaining Python and the necessary dependencies up to date in each host &#x2F; container.<p>(2) and (3) are trivial when done just once in your own computer, but end up being a huge time sink for larger heterogeneous environments with (possibly) network and security barriers. Moreover, if you are using containers, installing Python will make images unecessarily large.<p>Granted, I&#x27;m not a JS person, but I imagine one will have the same issues.<p>Even though bash has its shortcomings, I really appreciate how low maintenance it is as long as you keep scripts small and sane.

            It&#x27;s also unlikely you have Python installed on Windows though, and there&#x27;s a non-insignificant change that&#x27;s an old or random version (probably even Python 2). You can&#x27;t rely on anything on Windows, so you&#x27;re definitely going to also install a runtime from Chocolatey or similar.

            I&#x27;ve seen instances of some Unix systems not having Perl installed, but that&#x27;s very rare.

            JS is marginally better than Python for this, because tools for runtime and package version management are better for Node than for Python (proper lockfiles, local package folders, npm bundled with Node for installation, etc.).<p>Still, zx isn&#x27;t as nice as Ruby, which has backticks for calling shell as part of the language. So, you don&#x27;t have to have a separate package installed, just the ruby runtine.<p>But Perl is even better! Just like Ruby, it comes with backtick shell execution build-in, but unlike Ruby Perl is ubiquitous and is pretty strict about backward compatibility. So, your scripts will just run on all machines you have, no matter what distro you use and how old the machine is (within reason).

            Bash just sort happened to be the lowest common denominator in most unix style environments.  Because it just sorta ended up being the default.  Unix ended up being this different thing where each distro seems to be kind of unique.  Then on top of that they are very easy to customize.  So while one distro you can assume a particular python level the next disto python is totally optional.  Mix in containers and docker images and you have a new level of &#x27;what may or may not be there&#x27;.  Ah but you may say &#x27;oh just use tech XYZ&#x27; that may or may not have the exact same issue as using python in its place.  So either &#x27;deal with it&#x27; and install what is needed and keep it up to date.  Or &#x27;play the LCD game&#x27; you use only the bare min and hope you can build something useful enough in bash when another lang may be more appropriate.

            My understanding is that sh is a specification, not an implementation.<p>Most images will either have bash or ash installed. ash, being lightweight, is the choice of alpine and related distros.

            This is a bit of a Linux specific view of the universe. Yes posix has a standard for how sh should work. But there were specific implementations of sh, and you would get those on commercial Unix or *BSD.<p>Later shells came in and filled some gaps. OpenBSD still has ksh by default. Linux distros had bash as their &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh.

            Yup - or at least that’s what Google tells their employees. Want to publish something - you’d better get permission, and stick the Google name on it. And based on my limited understanding of the US contracts, is also true in practice.<p>There are some exceptions depending on local laws and contracts though, so it’s only mostly and not always true.

            This isn&#x27;t correct: if a Googler writes some code from scratch, which is unrelated to their work, on their personal time, and using their personal laptop... then it&#x27;s definitely not owned by Google.<p>There could be gray areas where code ownership could be disputed, but in general your employer owns only the intellectual property it paid for.<p>Source: I&#x27;m a Googler (until next month).

            Not true. You need explicit permission (there is a process for obtaining it, and it is very lightweight as I&#x27;ve done it myself). The general idea is that you get permission without much hassle if you develop something that doesn&#x27;t compete with Google. You need to argue your case otherwise.<p>Source: I&#x27;m a Googler that went through the process before.<p>Edit #1
for all Googlers reading this: search &quot;IARC&quot; internally and you should land on the proper page to kickstart the process.

            Many companies make claims over their employees&#x27; intellectual property.

            Maybe true, but I am unwilling to try my luck. I mean, the process I mentioned above takes 30 minutes [1] if it&#x27;s clear you aren&#x27;t competing with Google and so I don&#x27;t see a major issue about playing it safe and have written consent to develop your idea&#x2F;project.<p>[1] you fill a form with the general idea description, you explain succinctly why it doesn&#x27;t compete to any Google product, and you acknowledge you won&#x27;t use Google time and resources to develop it.

            It takes maybe 30 minutes to fill out, but the O(days) approval latency is what absolutely killed me. No way to do impromptu commits to random non-Google-license-approved projects, no way to hack together something with friends over a beer, no way to quickly bash together a proof of concept and release it the same evening.<p>It might work for people who chisel away at their own long-term one-person pet projects, but breaks down if you&#x27;re used to quickly hacking away collaboratively in various groups. Especially if you&#x27;re an active member of a hackerspace.

            Many countries have a &quot;formula&quot; (legal definition) for a &quot;contract&quot;, which include fair exchange of something for something else, e.g. time and labor for money. If Google forces their developers to work for free (labor for nothing), then it fails to meet legal definition of the contract.<p>IMHO, such &quot;forced labor for free&quot; is a form of slavery. Slavery is forbidden by law.<p>If a developer want to publish his project under Google brand, then exchange may be considered as fair (project code for Google branding).

            The IARC process is only necessary when Google might own copyright in the first place (those gray areas I mentioned earlier).<p>I went through the IARC process 2 years ago for a startup I was about to found in Tokyo, and obtaining clearance was easy, as you say. It&#x27;s an extra precaution to avoid future litigation, but not legally required if you keep your personal coding activity clearly and provably separate from your work activity.

The offer I received (and declined, primarily for other reasons but this was on the list) in 2017 clearly stated that it had to be unrelated to any of <i>Google&#x27;s</i> work as a whole, and in fact to Google&#x27;s actual or anticipated work - not just to the employee&#x27;s assigned work.

            Often they are not entirely personal in that they wrote the code using 20% time (so this is code paid for by Google) and use them as part of their job and&#x2F;or make them available to other users internally.

            I suppose it&#x27;s easy to poke fun at combining the &quot;best&quot; of shell scripting and JS.  But, the examples of using await() with child processes and pipes are pretty nice, and less verbose than the Perl or Python equivalents. It does seem well designed for anything where you&#x27;re orchestrating parallel runs of commands.

            What I don’t like about backticks in Ruby is that they “ignore” errors in commands you run. It’s up to the program author to remember to check $? for the last executed command’s exit status. And guess how many times the average Ruby script using this feature implements error handling? Usually it’s totally forgotten.<p>To be safe, abstractions that make it easy to shell out must also:<p>- escape all variable interpolations by default using “shellwords” or similar.<p>- throw exceptions on error by default.<p>Backticks in Ruby are very easy to use, but aren’t safe.

            I agree that people often don&#x27;t treat the exit code the way they should when using the backticks. However there&#x27;s better options in the ruby stdlib too, like `system` and `spawn` and `popen`. Using the other methods allows you to also sidestep the shell if you know the arguments you want to pass.

            Yes. I started programming in JavaScript in 1999 and Python in 2003, so it is my subjective opinion based on mastering the both languages. There are some factual and objevtive features making Python syntax more friendly, but it is a worth of a blog post to explore. And in the end there is no point, as JavaScript maximalists would not care.

            The problem is Node, especially all the packages that you’ll end up using under the hood, it’s seems quite risky especially if you don’t have super tight control over your Node SBOM.<p>Would be a bit more interesting to me if it was a JS shell built from the ground up without the entire mess of the Node package dependency baggage.

            While I agree that Node&#x27;s ecosystem is not the best, it&#x27;s what we have in the frontend world.<p>If you&#x27;re working on a Node-based service or React app, you already have to deal with Node and its package ecosystem. Adding a couple of extra MB (or even KB, depending on package reuse) on top of your existing chain of dependencies is a tiny con to the huge benefit of not having to do logic in Bash :)

            Maybe but Python is <i>sloooow</i> and its type annotation situation is pretty poor.<p>I would recommend using Deno. It has the following advantages:<p>* Uses Typescript which gives you a great static typing system.<p>* Runs via V8 so it&#x27;s about a million times faster than Python.<p>* Single statically linked binary with no project setup files required (package.json&#x2F;dependencies.txt) makes it about a million times easier to deploy than either Node or Python. Especially on Windows.<p>* You can still use third party libraries even without a project file and you get IDE integration.<p>It&#x27;s the clear winner at this point.

            Startup time is very slow. I just tested on my system and cold startup was 1 second (!) and hot 180ms. Vs 80ms and 64ms for Node.<p>Also it obviously depends what your CLI tool is doing. Just because something is a CLI tool doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t do much stuff and therefore performance doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>For example Scons is a CLI tool. It&#x27;s a build system written in Python. Everybody abandoned it because it was dog slow.<p>Mercurial is a CLI tool. It&#x27;s a VCS written in Python. Most people have abandoned it partly because it is slow (and partly because Github exists).<p>You can read about Mercurial&#x27;s troubles with Python performance here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurial-scm.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OxidationPlan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurial-scm.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OxidationPlan</a><p>&gt; Performance is a significant pain point with Python. There are multiple facets to the performance problem:<p>&gt; * Startup overhead<p>&gt; * General performance overhead compared to <i>native</i> code<p>&gt; * GIL interfering with parallel execution<p>&gt; It takes several dozen milliseconds to start a Python interpreter and load the Mercurial Python modules. If you have many extensions loaded, it could take well over 100ms just to effectively get to a Mercurial command&#x27;s main function. Reports of over 250ms are known. While the command itself may complete in mere milliseconds, Python overhead has already made hg seem non-instantaneous to end-users.

            It is definitely noticeable even when you run a command once. But it really becomes a problem when your command is run lots of times as part of some other system.<p>For example if you&#x27;re using Python to process a lot of files via Make (something my work&#x27;s build system does unfortunately) then it can end up costing 10s of seconds which is kind of insane.

            I would say that it&#x27;s more that Bash is good at something and JavaScript is good at other things and just because they are technically scripting languages doesn&#x27;t mean that they are naturally a good fit in each other&#x27;s domains. The README&#x27;s comment tends to point towards an idea that all languages that can write scripts are equally interchangeable and of all choices JavaScript is the perfect choice. To people that are working on a variety of scripts in numerous languages who all have individual advantages and disadvantages, it comes off as nonsense.

            I think definitely there are better alternatives to JS in command line world like python  but if someone decided to use something other than bash as a programming language that’s a win in my book.

            I think the idea is that the majority of the script will be written in pure JS, with only occasional calls out to subprocesses, so “every command” is far from every line.<p>You frequently see the same mental mismatch when shell-scripters try to use Python, and complain how hard it is to pipe with POpen, instead of using the built in string processing features.

            I wonder if they could use some kind of magic to create synchronous versions of all async APIs (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;giuseppegurgone.com&#x2F;synchronizing-async-functions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;giuseppegurgone.com&#x2F;synchronizing-async-functions&#x2F;</a>)<p>Although this would be fighting the language...

            Requiring it for every command by default sucks, but on the other hand, the ability to easily make scripts async is a huge benefit.<p>I&#x27;ve seen so many cases of processes being synchronous simply because doing it differently would require an unrealistic amount of custom parallelism code.

            I don&#x27;t think this holds. As the rule goes, there are only three cardinal numbers: zero, one, many. What are the chances you product has only two meaningful personas - &quot;users&quot; and &quot;developers&quot;?<p>Take that payment system. People who buy things are obviously users, people who write CMS plugins for that system are obviously developers. But what about, say, analysts studying reports from that system?

            Template tag functions in JS can intercept the interpolation values passed in. So it&#x27;s possible they&#x27;re automatically escaping to prevent shell injection.<p>They could also be parsing out the first word as the command and not using shell execution at all.
