            can&#x27;t reply to the latest message. Rite now it&#x27;s theft. Tax&#x27;s aren&#x27;t used for american society. They&#x27;re used to steal money from the poorest of our country to give to the richest of others (all the &quot;foreign aid&quot; is stolen through the inefficiency of bureaucracy). I&#x27;d be happy to pay taxes for services that I actually use, like roads and a police force and a fire station. But it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to throw money into subsidizing somebody else&#x27;s company or some other countries problems

            Oh how terrible... Taxes on 300 million in transactions by people who mostly don&#x27;t affect my life directly at all were nefariously prevented from falling into the hands of noble government agencies that would spend them on wonderful things like severely bloated bureaucracies, wars, military equipment for local police, violent swat teams, grotesque drug war operations, pork projects and so forth. It&#x27;s an absolute tragedy. I know that government spends much on many necessary public projects, but it also wastes vast quantities of tax dollars (arguably much more than is lost to money laundering or tax evasion) on boondoggles. Thus, at some point, it would be a good idea to also question the moralizing logic of associating all lost tax revenues with crushing losses to the &quot;public good&quot;. Focus can also be made on simply forcing vast existing tax revenues to be used better, no?<p>Also, note: Libertine is not the same as libertarian, might want to know the definitions of basic terminology before slinging accusations of ideological bias.<p>made a couple edits.
