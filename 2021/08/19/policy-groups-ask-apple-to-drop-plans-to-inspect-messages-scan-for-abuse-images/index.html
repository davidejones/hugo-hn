            Apple did this in such a myopic, I want to say almost comically stupid manner.

            All of the PR out of Apple seems to assume that people simply do not understand how it works and if they did they would feel better.<p>Everyone understands well enough how it works and understands how trivially it could be changed to search for other kinds of content.

            Right.<p>At some point, the back story behind this will leak out. That will be interesting. This has to be something Apple was asked&#x2F;pressured&#x2F;ordered to do. As a business activity it makes no sense.<p>Bear in mind that over the last week, people in Afghanistan have been frantically trying to erase any evidence of doing things the Taliban doesn&#x27;t like, such as women playing sports.

And it&#x27;s  hard for me to imagine the US government doing that without some court battle with serious risk of leaks to journalists. I mean, it makes no financial sense, so Apple would fight that. The only thing I can imagine is pressure from a private interest whose market is big enough for Apple to care. And if it is <i>that market</i>, then I think we&#x27;re in for a tough ride until we can build our own devices.

            I think there&#x27;s some strong hints in apple&#x27;s implementation that they were under external pressure.<p>If you read the documentation on how it&#x27;s implemented, there&#x27;s some fairly advanced crypto - private set intersection, threshold secret sharing - that only makes sense if Apple took the line &quot;we have to do this, but we&#x27;re willing to do it in a really expensive way so that we ourselves have as little access as possible&quot;. They went to the effort of running the NeuralHash on the client device, as far as I understand.<p>The standard implementation on other cloud providers is that the provider has access to your data on the server if they really need it - much cheaper, and makes it technically possible in future to easily change the T&amp;C to &quot;we may use this for market research and to improve our products&quot;. I view Apple&#x27;s client-side implementation as drawing a very big line in the sand saying we will not do that and we are willing to put our money where our mouth is by writing this crypto protocol.<p>But that certainly raises the question, why would Apple do anything like that at all, unless there&#x27;s some (current or anticipated) external threat that forced them to?<p>As to whether we&#x27;ll ever discover it - I wouldn&#x27;t have predicted the Snowden revelations, maybe this will come out the next time something like that happens. If it does, I also predict we&#x27;ll be shocked to discover just how big the market and distribution network for child abuse online is, and how many people are involved.

            &gt; I also predict we&#x27;ll be shocked to discover just how big the market and distribution network for child abuse online is, and how many people are involved.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is big compared to what authoritarian states would like to use this for. You&#x27;re talking about, at the very least, putting everyone in non-democratic states under even more pressure to obey than they&#x27;re already under. And in democratic states this invites bad actors both in and outside the government. There is no net-gain in justice here. It&#x27;s wrong across the board.<p>Welcome back to HN after taking 5 months off, btw. You&#x27;re a SSC fan?

            Thanks!<p>Yes, I agree the state market is even bigger - China&#x27;s potential market for surveillance alone is 1.3 billion and rising - but I&#x27;ve heard from colleagues in tech who seriously think child abuse is only a very small number of bad actors. My understanding is the &quot;industry&quot; is almost as out of control as the illegal drugs trade.<p>I am indeed a SSC&#x2F;ACX fan (and subscriber).

            While that is true, the security concerns are much wider than child abuse scanning. From the article:<p>&gt; &quot;Though these capabilities are intended to protect children and to reduce the spread of child sexual abuse material, we are concerned that they will be used to censor protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world, and have disastrous consequences for many children,&quot;<p>Many people and organizations fear that Apple&#x27;s plans are paving the way for governments to scan for more than just child abuse images.
(e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleprivacyletter.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleprivacyletter.com&#x2F;</a>)<p>In that light, FISA is relevant. My statement was to show that not all dealings of the US government are public, because not all courts and legal proceedings are available to the public. So &quot;serious risk of leaks to journalists&quot; won&#x27;t likely happen in that case.

            Based on the letter by NCMEC describing opponents to the technology as <i>“screeching voices of the minority”</i>, I suspect this is some kind of variant of being guilted into doing <i>something</i> by either lobbying, marketing or internal proponents. This resulted in a tone deaf death march and now they’re trying to work out how to spin it.<p>This is a fairly typical corporate failure mode.<p>Sometimes the best thing is to do nothing as they have found out because now they’re stuck in a position where the two exits are either piss off everyone by writing off their privacy stance or piss off everyone else for canning child porn scanning.<p>What a complete fuck up.

            You might be right. On the other hand, all their past controversial ideas were reasonable from the financial point of view: introduce non-standard connectors, remove the minijack, make the hardware non-upgradeable and so on. All these things were bad for consumers, but good for Apple&#x27;s bottom line. This one is bad for everybody. Apple&#x27;s management is not stupid, they must have a good reason.

            The scanning matches against CSAM hashes provided by NCMEC - the fear is that NCMEC will be pressured into including hashes of non-CSAM material that USGOV want to track as well (say MAGA images for the current administration.)<p>(One counterpoint to this is that PhotoDNA has been used for scanning cloud images using NCMEC-provided hashes for a decade now and this slippery slope doesn&#x27;t seem to have happened yet.)

            this is a very weak argument.

            There is also international perspective: once this mechanism is in place, forced by US, it will become normalized in several years.

The regulatory capture of industries is an ongoing thing. When 20 years ago you could start your own business in your garage, without substantial capital, today you are dependent on &quot;Angel investors&quot; and bank loans, which is an equivalent of having to be referred into a &quot;club&quot;. If you can&#x27;t find an investor, it will take you a lifetime to save money to start a business, if you are lucky.

            I’m starting to wonder if this is Apple’s strategy all along. They’ve had pressure for years from law enforcement to abuse their monopoly power to invade people&#x27;s privacy. So they implement it in a relatively naive approach and sell in a hamfisted way, so that everyone turns against them for a little while. Apple backs off, and every time after this they point law enforcement to this debacle. See, we can’t help you, our customers wouldn’t tolerate it!<p>Not sure if it’s true or not, but we shouldn’t assume companies always intend their public plans to succeed. Maybe they actually want a high profile retreat — it could certainly save them development time down the road by not implementing government misfeatures.

            My initial response was that maybe that&#x27;s why Apples software development has gone down in quality so much in the recent years.

            I deeply hope that he gets pushed out because of this. The skeuomorphism guy was definitely horrible and obviously was the cause of many assaults upon the senses, but this CSAM spyware scandal was such an affront on all that democratic, enlightened society holds close to the chest.<p>There are so many more talented software development leaders out there (maybe scratch all the ones working on adtech), but he&#x27;s clearly a cultural troglodyte and this is evidence that he is incapable of actually leading the future engineers and software workers of the world.<p>If I saw him in a social setting I would try to ask him how he lives with himself, actively enabling the potential future dystopia and being incapable of defending the actual impetus of his actions, much less the reaction to it.

            &gt; If I saw him in a social setting I would try to ask him how he lives with himself, actively enabling the potential future dystopia and being incapable of defending the actual impetus of his actions, much less the reaction to it. Truly unforgivable, especially in an age of increased social fragmentation.<p>He seems like a guy who genuinely believe that what he&#x27;s doing is a net positive for society and that society should just leave things in his hands.<p>There are plenty of people like that at google last I remember. I used to go to the google dev day and the was no greater difference between really talented technical people presenting interesting things and engineering leadership believe that everyone should just have a dumb terminal in their hand and that google should do any processing and how that would be so much better for society.

            This part is legit though: governments around the world could pressure Apple to add other forms of surveillance. Be it hashes of non-CSAM, or simply pressure NEMEC or other hash providers, or extending its capabilities to all messages or photos on device.<p>In my opinion, this is the biggest concern, not the technology. Before, Apple could simply refuse by saying we don&#x27;t have the capabilities. But now, that excuse is gone. Apple&#x27;s promise to human review content and only report CSAM is the weakest link.

            Apple doesn&#x27;t even have to know how their scanner will be used.

            If you read their Security Threat Model Review [1] they&#x27;re only using the &quot;intersection of hashes provided by at least two child safety organizations operating in separate sovereign jurisdictions&quot;.<p>So you&#x27;d have to pressure NEMEC and another org under a different government to both add the non-CSAM hash, plus Apple would need to be pressured to verify a non-CSAM derivative image, plus you&#x27;d need other hash matches on-device to exceed the threshold before they could even do the review in the first place (they can&#x27;t even tell if there was a match unless the threshold is exceeded).<p>I get why people are concerned, but between this thread and the other thread yesterday it&#x27;s clear that pretty much everyone discussing this has no idea how it works.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Security_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Security_Threat_Model...</a>

            We have the same guarantee about that today as we did a month ago before this was announced. Apple writes the software that runs their devices, so they’ll always have the option to ship something like that.<p>Apple could have quietly implemented CSAM scanning server-side, and left the door open to it being quietly exploited in who knows what way. But they didn’t: instead they put a whole bunch of infrastructure in place that all but guarantees that they’ll be immediately caught (and publicly excoriated) if they try to use this CSAM mechanism for anything other than CSAM. (See the PDF that GP linked for technical details on why.)<p>Of course, they could still do it with some other mechanism. But in that case none of these CSAM changes are at all relevant to the concern, as that risk is unchanged from a month ago.

            The &quot;screeching minority&quot; memo gives some insight. Let me break it down line by line. This is just my personal opinion as an external observer; I have no actual insight into what was going on.<p><i>Team Apple,</i><p>This is from someone outside the Apple ecosystem that management brought in and gave a lot of credence to.<p><i>I wanted to share a note of encouragement to say that everyone at NCMEC is SO PROUD of each of you and the incredible decisions you have made in the name of prioritizing child protection.</i><p>The recipients of this memo didn&#x27;t make any of the decisions and those were foisted on them by management who in turn were heavily influenced by this person&#x2F;organization. As to why management was so heavily influenced, I have no idea. This is an attempt to get buy-in from Apple employees I suspect, or at least to ease their concerns. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, you are doing the right thing.&quot;<p><i>It’s been invigorating for our entire team to see (and play a small role in) what you unveiled today.</i><p>The team they are referring to are the ones that pushed for the implementation for child protection. The recipients did all the work because management told them to.<p><i>I know it’s been a long day and that many of you probably haven’t slept in 24 hours. We know that the days to come will be filled with the screeching voices of the minority.</i><p>This is the big quote. The author knew what this would do, and knows the tarnish the Apple brand is about to go through, but is trying to convince the audience that it&#x27;s only a small group of people who will reject this and it will pass over.  For the author, the ends justify any means because they are probably personally emotionally traumatized by child porn (rightfully so). Once this happens though, any rationality about consequence of action goes out the window. This is an attempt to get everyone concerned on the same level of ends-justify-the-means with the author. I don&#x27;t know if the author believes this is just a temporary outrage or not. I suspect not. It doesn&#x27;t really matter though the author got what they wanted, Apple brand be damned.<p><i>Our voices will be louder.</i><p>This obviously isn&#x27;t the case. Not sure if the author means their organization or their organization + Apple. Either way, the counter resistance to this has been pretty minimal. They left Apple hang out to dry it seems.<p><i>Our commitment to lift up kids who have lived through the most unimaginable abuse and victimizations will be stronger.<p>During these long days and sleepless nights, I hope you take solace in knowing that because of you many thousands of sexually exploited victimized children will be rescued, and will get a chance at healing and the childhood they deserve.</i><p>This is the emotional sell, or &quot;for the children.&quot; It&#x27;s also a difficult bridge to reason across; comparing the possession of pictures and the manufacture of pictures as the same thing. Obviously the hash compare only finds existing manufactured pictures, so I don&#x27;t see how it will protect children from any abuse that hasn&#x27;t already occurred. Not only is this an emotional sell, it&#x27;s a lie.<p><i>Thank you for finding a path forward for child protection while preserving privacy.</i><p>The final emotional pitch directed at people at Apple typically concerned with privacy. They aren&#x27;t really protecting children and they also aren&#x27;t preserving privacy. It&#x27;s a boondoggle.<p>In closing, &quot;for the children,&quot; is almost always a trap. It was used when I was a kid to mass incarcerate Americans that had drug problems, many of them the children they were protecting. It&#x27;s typically done in an any-means-necessary heavy handed manner, as seen here. I don&#x27;t condone child pornography in any way. I have never seen child pornography and hope to never see it. At the same time, what they are doing is the road to hell paved with good intentions seemingly by people who are so traumatized (based on their work) that they can&#x27;t see the collateral damage they are doing.

            The real question is: how can they make sure people are not committing other crimes? They better scan all messages at all times. Are they meeting more people face to face than the government permits?

            In fact, couldn&#x27;t we go even further, taking inspiration from Apple?<p>Plumbing installed in people&#x27;s homes should scan for illegally consumed narcotics or prescription medications and check them against pharmacy records. Your home&#x27;s electrical wiring should make sure it&#x27;s not being used to illegally grow drugs. Cellphone cameras should make sure they never record a naked body without a signed consent waiver. Guitar amplifiers should verify that you&#x27;re not playing an owned piece of music without a license.<p>How could we ever survive in a world where we relied upon targeted investigations and probable cause?

            According to that line of thought, we wouldn&#x27;t have speed cameras because they can&#x27;t be used to detect e.g. drunk driving.<p>It&#x27;s fair IMO to use fit for purpose technology to target specific crimes.<p>Though I agree this is bad technology, not fit for purpose, and they should yank it.

            I am glad that Apple has shown the true colors of trillion dollar corporation thinking. 
I see opportunity for people to understand the biggest problem with a future in which humans are only a datapoint in framework designed to benefit few on expense of many.<p>Can you imagine this &quot;narrative&quot; applied everywhere? From the moment you open your eyes everything around you is extracting data, monitoring and policing you.<p>We have to redefine our relationship with software and hardware (electronics). The infrastructure (5g) and IOT advancements are here. Data is the fuel of the coming &quot;consumer revolution&quot;.
Apple just positioned themselves perfectly as a Data Broker for high level customers - special groups, oppressive governments, you name it.<p>They will not back up from this. This is more profitable than selling shiny toys and &quot;services&quot;.
This gives political elites a reason not to break Apple monopolistic business practices.<p>I will go even further: This gives Apple a favorable position to become a trusted partner of governments of the World.<p>Deconstructing this only from a technical point of view is non-efficient. Apple is making an entrance on political stage by embracing the role of World Digital Police.<p>Everyone is free to apply his own conclusions and analysis. 
Mine are proportionally adequate. I have removed macOS from production workflow. 
I will never buy another Apple product. And I am willing to throw away &quot;conveniences&quot; and polished UX for preserving my privacy.<p>This privacy, not Apples corporate redefinition:<p>The quality or condition of being secluded from the presence or view of others.
The state of being free from public attention or unsanctioned intrusion.
A state of being private, or in retirement from the company or from the knowledge or observation of others; seclusion.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=z15JLtAuwVI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=z15JLtAuwVI</a>

            No reason why you can&#x27;t just generate random images and add them to the real database, indistinguishable from actual hashes. As long as the test images aren&#x27;t public it&#x27;s low risk, and even if they leak they could be removed from the database and new test images could be generated.

            Apple&#x27;s &quot;CSAM detection&quot; feature is a two-part on-device&#x2F;server as I understand it:<p>1: Run on-device code to perform perceptual hash comparison of each photo against 
an on-device encrypted database of known CSAM hashes.<p>2: On iCloud Photos servers, send out the relevant notifications when a user’s iCloud Photos 
account exceeds a threshold of positive matches.<p>So as a high level testing strategy, I would want to:<p>- Verify on-device lookup of CSAM hashes. This could be tested by provisioning a test device with an on-device database containing CSAM hashes of images that aren&#x27;t illegal. As a bystander, I think I&#x27;d be fairly confident with this approach because I&#x27;m guessing the on-device database that Apple ships could conceivably be changed over time to expand the definition of the images it will flag as CSAM.<p>- Do some exploratory testing to discover the threshold of how much image manipulation can be done on a flagged image before the perceptual hash comparison fails to return a match.<p>- Verify that the notification system notifies the correct parties once a user account exceeds the defined threshold of positive CSAM matches.<p>- Ensure the flagged account can still be investigated if user deletes the offending material from iCloud, or their account by the time a real person gets around to investigating.<p>- Ensure that the logging is informative and adequate (contains device name, timestamp, etc.).<p>- Test behaviour on same iCloud account logged in to multiple devices.<p>- Figure out any additional business logic - are positive matches a permanent count on the account or are they reset after a certain amount of time?<p>source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Security_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Security_Threat_Model...</a>

            I want to ignore most of this article to complain about an inaccuracy that keeps coming up.<p>&gt; More broadly, they said the change will break end-to-end encryption for iMessage, which Apple has staunchly defended in other contexts.<p>But... it wouldn&#x27;t. The iMessage feature doesn&#x27;t expose the contents of your message to anyone else under any circumstance.<p>If you&#x27;re a child under 13 and your parents have opted in to this feature, you get a choice of seeing naked-pictures sent to you and having your parents be notified that you chose to, and not seeing it with no notifications of anything. (But once you&#x27;re 13+, no notifications would occur either way.)<p>There <i>are</i> potential issues with this, mostly relating to abusive families being controlling. They&#x27;d have to do weird things like forcing their teenaged children to keep making new under-13 accounts to actually take advantage of it like that, though. And none of these issues impact the e2e status of iMessage in any way.<p>Apple really screwed up PR by launching the iMessage feature alongside the scanning-and-reporting iCloud Photos feature. There&#x27;s so much confusion out there about this.<p>(The breaking-e2e aspect <i>does</i> exist with the iCloud Photos scanning... not that it&#x27;s currently e2e, of course.)

            Okay, but your device literally <i>has</i> to decrypt the message in order to show it to you. It then does other things that are vaguely &quot;content analysis&quot; like generating link previews and marking up the text to make dates clickable.<p>The iMessage feature is &quot;it looks like someone has sent you a picture of their dick, are you sure you want to see that?&quot; I know <i>adults</i> who&#x27;d like to turn that feature on.<p>Could it hypothetically be extended in the future?

            How does this break e2e for Messages? They&#x27;re still only ever decrypted on your device, and their content is never shared with others.

            Although this is true, none of the major cloud services seem inclined to actually do that. Google, Microsoft, Dropbox, Facebook, they&#x27;re all scanning photos[0].<p>Let&#x27;s not pretend that this sort of thing is happening in isolation. There really is a big legal movement towards requiring encryption backdoors, and programs like Apple&#x27;s here are effectively part of a big negotiation with law enforcement -- note that the reason Apple&#x27;s currently <i>not</i> e2e is apparently that the FBI pushed them on it[1]. &quot;We&#x27;ll give you what you claim is important, CSAM scans, and in return we&#x27;ll lock everything else up securely&quot;.

            I don’t think anyone within Apple is pushing for this, I assume the pressure is coming from somewhere external or they’re anticipating pressure because the feature doesn’t really make a lot of sense right now. We’ll probably get the actual truth years from now in some leak.

            It&#x27;s so bizarre how hard they&#x27;re pushing this, even though they don&#x27;t really gain much from it. This is especially weird because Apple has always pushed for user privacy. I just don&#x27;t get it.

            I heard he was pushed out not due to the failure but that he refused to improve and accept the mistakes that he made. It pissed off Tim Cook who was already mad that he apparently couldn&#x27;t work with the other team members well.<p>Take all this with a grain of salt. I wonder if Jobs was just good at managing these brash personalities together.

            Both phones have their modems separated from the OS with USB&#x2F;M.2 interfaces. Also, they have kill switches. Pinephone&#x27;s modem even runs Linux: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxsmartphones.com&#x2F;hackers-develop-open-source-firmware-for-the-pinephone-modem-use-it-to-make-phone-calls&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxsmartphones.com&#x2F;hackers-develop-open-source-fir...</a>.

            I understand what you are saying, but in my opinion that doesn&#x27;t really answer the question.  For a phone to attach to a network, there is some level of bidirectional trust and those kill-switches aren&#x27;t going to just arbitrarily activate.  Has anyone at a wireless provider tested pushing OTA updates to those phones?  Has the vendor explicitly stated that the phones will explicitly block by default any attempts at OTA updates or that the phones explicitly do not have the capability?

            I don&#x27;t think any vendor confirmed that. But is this possible to update software on my device without permission by its OS via a well-defined external interface? These phones are desktop computers running GNU&#x2F;Linux. If they can be updated this way, then my laptop can as well be updated by a WiFi card, can&#x27;t it?

            I suppose it depends on what standards each of these Linux phone implementations have followed.  Android also runs Linux, but they modified it to give the wireless providers and Google full control, hence people wanting to root their phones.  Just running Linux is not enough to give me confidence that the phone is truly isolated from network management.  So I suppose it comes down to what kernel modules, libraries and trust these phones are giving to the provider and what standards they are following.  A good start would be independent kernel hackers digging into the hardware and OS to see what they can make the phone do and what they see the phone doing under normal operations when attaching to the network and how the phone responds to OTA update attempts and what the firmware on the phone is doing.  If I control the firmware and you control the OS, I control what your OS can read and write to.  So I suppose my unanswered questions are:<p>- Who writes and maintains the firmware the OS is running on.<p>- Who writes and maintains the modem firmware and who can update it.<p>- Who can update that firmware for the board the OS is running on.  This could be a different answer than who initially creates it for the retail distribution of the phone.<p>- What level of trust has been inserted into the OS by kernel modules and who maintains those kernel modules.<p>- What control is given to the end user to see what those modules are doing and limit what they can do.<p>I suspect more questions could arise as kernel hackers audited the phone.  The dilemma I see is that such kernel hackers won&#x27;t be interested until those phones are wildly popular.  The only other way to get their interest is with money.

            In the US, if I understand correctly, those would be true positives, and everyone who created, received, or distributed them would be guilty of a crime. There’s no exception in the law for pictures you took of yourself.

            There might not be a law, but in practice, letting criminals host illegal data on your servers is unlikely to be a good look.<p>The intent of the laws making the possession CSAM illegal are ultimately to stop the spread of CSAM. If those laws fail in their stated purpose just because a company chooses not to be proactive in how it searches for the material, that would be missing the point. The media and governmental pressure would wipe any company foolish enough not to implement child safety measures out of existence, but no major tech company is that foolish (except Kik perhaps). And hypothetically, the government could just pass a law enforcing proactive scanning if there were to exist a company that chose not to proactively scan, which would mean that the government would fail to solve the issue of preventing the spread of CSAM, and thus CSA.<p>But in practice, such a law isn&#x27;t needed. No company wants to be derided as a service that allows child abusers to get away with their crimes.

            Nobody expects Google and Facebook to care about privacy. Apple was the one running TV ads about how they were the privacy company. If Apple was really planning E2EE they would have announced it at the same time, because it would have been the perfect time to do it.

            That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work, but frankly, once the capability exists client-side, I don&#x27;t trust that it will continue to work that way.
