            Many countries have a funny concept of strategic industries.<p>In mine, dairy is a strategic industry that is coddled by government so that we can have a local source. But every country thinks that so there’s foes and allies that can supply us UHT or powder milk on a moment’s notice. And if our milk supply disappeared tomorrow, everyone over 1y could substitute with 10000000 different things for nutrition.<p>Cars are another. Every country props up its auto industry, so why worry about a domestic supply?<p>Meanwhile, there are critical components, pharma ingredients or other inputs built in 1 factory in a country we could likely end up in a big dispute with.<p>Just goes to show that industry protection has nothing to do with risk&#x2F;dependence on that product, and everything to do with picking and choosing which industries are important voting bases.

            Part of the reason fabs are spread out is capitalism: if you manufacture the part in the country, you don&#x27;t pay import taxes (e.g., Intel&#x27;s Ireland fab debacle).<p>Another part is lax environmental laws. Hillsboro Oregon is embroiled in a suit with Intel where Intel dumped 100x the fluorine into the air that they claimed when D1X was first pitched. Don&#x27;t need to worry about that stuff in Asia (for now).<p>Also, lead time. The x-ray litho machines take years to build and test. There are only two companies that make Intel&#x27;s testers, and the lead time is years. So a &quot;quick fix&quot; isn&#x27;t possible.<p>Speaking opinion: in the long term, it is mostly rich people trying to get richer that caused this. If greedy CEOs and shareholders would just be humans for once and think about the future we wouldn&#x27;t have this trainwreck. That ain&#x27;t ever gonna happen.

            The US isn&#x27;t starting from scratch. And presumably the total cost includes all the R&amp;D cycles. TSMC was started by a Texas Instruments employee.<p>But, if we assume they were, just double the cost as a sign-on bonus for all the engineers and poach away.<p>This is problem that can be solved with money, and not a lot of it in the grand scheme of things.

            Government can&#x27;t make a website, let alone a chip fab. Talk to Intel and ask them why we&#x27;ve fallen behind. Do any VCs want to fund a direct Intel competitor? I doubt it.<p>Making chips seems to be quite a bit more complicated than making and launching rockets, I don&#x27;t think even Elon Musk could do it.

            Just subsidize it. I&#x27;m not asking for the Fab Czar, I&#x27;m asking for the NSF, DARPA, and national subsidies for it. Accelerated permitting, tax breaks, tarif support, state vs national investments, accelerated green cards for key personnel, and price breaks for a &quot;buy US Chips&quot; initiative for the first 5 years until things get serious and exports ramp up. I&#x27;m spitballing over morning coffee, but come on, this seems obvious.<p>Exports won&#x27;t offset operating costs here in the USA, but perhaps we could apply some ingenuity to that through national research investments and the ensuing startup ecology. The ancillary benefits of funding research and small business infrastructure around the big fabs would be huge.<p>Sandia national labs has a ~3.5 annual Giga$ budget! That&#x27;s _entirely_ publicly funded and represents about half of TSMC&#x27;s operating budget (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investor.tsmc.com&#x2F;english&#x2F;encrypt&#x2F;files&#x2F;encrypt_file&#x2F;reports&#x2F;2021-01&#x2F;4Q20EarningsRelease.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investor.tsmc.com&#x2F;english&#x2F;encrypt&#x2F;files&#x2F;encrypt_file...</a> , looking at 50% profit yielding ~12 G$)

            &gt;<i>Government can&#x27;t make a website, let alone a chip fab.</i><p>Tbf, many (most?) government websites are built and maintained by private companies. Remember the ACA website debacle a few years back? The government was mad at the contractor for building a shoddy product. They claimed they would take action against them but I’m not sure anything happened. If the government should be held to task on anything it should be an inability to write good contracts or hold companies feet to the fire. I’ve heard civil servants are unwilling to to the latter because they don’t want to hurt businesses or are afraid of legal protests.

            Yes, but from what I understand, it won&#x27;t be the most advanced plant making the smallest feature sizes. Understandably, TSMC keeps a tight reign on their top-tier production methods, which is their reason for being #1.<p>It&#x27;s also 3 years away from opening in AZ (2024). Then they have to fine tune the equipment and processes over x runs. New plants tend to have low yields until those processes are smoothed out and perfected. You don&#x27;t just set up a plant and start churning out chips with 98% success rate at 5nm once the factory is built. It probably takes 5-6 years from construction start to churning out quality chips in numbers that are actually profitable.

            Highly visible industries tend to get a disproportionate number of subsidies, because the population can relate to them, and politicians aren&#x27;t that clever either. Film and television are good examples, and fishing tends to get a lot of attention too.

            Yea this is very interesting. I suspect another side to this though is I don&#x27;t know that one country can easily or safely not participate in this chosen industry support.<p>Especially in capital intensive industries, say cars, all of the competing countries are propping up or bailing out their auto industries. So even if companies should theoretically die and get replaced, there is a structural disadvantage as the competition in other countries has an insurance policy against companies failing (bailout &#x2F; subsidy &#x2F; tariffs &#x2F; strategic protection &#x2F; etc).

            On that matter, I think (just a not-so-well-informed opinion but still plausible) most countries should urgently protect their software development industry and dramatically reduce taxes on those companies.

            &gt; Every country props up its auto industry, so why worry about a domestic supply?<p>War. In the event a war breaks out, a running auto plant can be re-tooled relatively rapidly into a light and heavy armor plant.

            So, apparently the best opening salvo is to take out USA comms satellites and that essentially cripples American offensive capabilities. Modern tomahawks are heavily reliant on comms networks to hit long-range ground targets.<p>Plus, any destroyer launching these at targets deep in Chinese territory will be within range of Chinese missiles.  And, as we saw in Syria, Russian air defense systems are pretty effective against Tomahawks, and we should expect Chinese systems to be at least as effective.

            The issue is that China needs energy and other natural resources to sustain production which the US and allies can effectively blockade. It always puzzles me why China is so antagonistic with its neighbours. Indochina is very difficult to invade, and the whole South China Seas situation means that China has no blue ocean access into the Pacific. In a global war, the only reliable lifeline into China is through Russia.

            Great question. It&#x27;s still doctrinally true (i.e. governments believe it is true; it was one of the reasons cited for the US federal government buying key stake in domestic auto manufacturers instead of letting them go bankrupt during the real estate market crash), but whether light and heavy armor is <i>actually</i> of military worth in an era of drones and air power is a question I don&#x27;t have the military training or knowledge to answer.

            That&#x27;s the same reason why food security is so high up on domestic priorities also. If a country is dependant on other nations for food, then in case of war you just need to target their logistics chain to starve them into submission. All those subsidies make sense, if you view the nation-state as primarily concerned with its own survival.

            this. If you look at all the strategic industry subsidies, you will see this common denominator. Corn in the US is stupidly subsidized, so much corn that it ends up in car tanks. But guess who will not have a famine even if the worst war + disasters strike?<p>Car factories might not make good tanks, but the mechanical engineers and tooling knowledge is invaluable and can&#x27;t be scaled up overnight.<p>Same with solar panels, there&#x27;s a reason both Obama and Trump imposed protective tariffs. One of the few areas both parties agree to. PV panels are the future of energy, so you need to have domestic factories no matter the cost.

            &gt; PV panels are the future of energy, so you need to have domestic factories no matter the cost.<p>Another benefit of domestic factories is domestic innovation. It&#x27;s much harder for an engineer coming out of university and going through their career working at an office computer terminal to ever make a breakthrough innovation, if they can&#x27;t step inside the factory to see how things are really done.<p>If that factory is down the street, it&#x27;s much easier to do an apprenticeship, get a tour, or chat with the manager about their pain points. If it&#x27;s in another country, you&#x27;ll have to schedule a formal visit and you&#x27;ll probably need to be a very important customer for that to happen.

            Just the opposite.  Need to let people raise prices to encourage slack in the system.  Let’s prices settle where chip makers can produce new chips.<p>There are market failures where the government needs to step in, but this isn’t one.

            It&#x27;s a puzzle to me why companies like nvidia didn&#x27;t just raise prices and instead left both customers and profit to the dirty world of scalpers.<p>I guess it&#x27;s &quot;brand damage&quot; but I feel there would be something more fair and honest if in times of tight supply they ran their own ebay-like store and auctioned them off. It wouldn&#x27;t feel like a price hike and prices could automatically settle as supply&#x2F;demand reaches parity.

            It&#x27;s a Taiwanese company around since the 90s. They may be more Europe focused with a German office. I&#x27;ve never heard a US reviewer mention them but in the UK, they offer cards cheaper than the other brands. Beyond that, I don&#x27;t know much about them.

            &gt; <i>Need to let people raise prices to encourage slack in the system</i><p>You&#x27;re assuming that increased profit margins will automatically increase supply chain buffers. But rather, the same incentive to hire too many financialists that &quot;save the company money&quot; will exist, and the extra profit margin will just go to increased dividends.<p>And increasing the supply chain buffers won&#x27;t help much right now either, it has to be done during good times.

            I don&#x27;t see that raising prices would make consuming companies want to stock up less.  A company that requires an input to manufacturing is going to have a pretty steep price-demand curve for every individual component. Even if prices for one of their scarce inputs doubles, they&#x27;re still going to buy as much as they can rather than risk shutting down their entire production if they run out. Since their competitors are feeling the same pressure, they&#x27;ll just raise their own prices to compensate.<p>It&#x27;s like foodstuffs during the early pandemic - when you finally found something that they had been out of, you didn&#x27;t particularly care about the price, and you generally bought extra so you wouldn&#x27;t run out if it went missing again.

            &gt; they&#x27;ll just raise their own prices to compensate.<p>That&#x27;s how it works in econ 101, but not necessarily in practice. Prices on many goods are less flexible than commodities like oil and lumber, for many reasons. Manufacturers may be locked into fixed-price contracts or distribution agreements, for example. Or a scarce component might be shared across &quot;budget&quot; and &quot;premium&quot; product lines, but the budget line is too price sensitive to change so the premium product goes up 10x instead. Or the company just borrows money and eats the loss...

            1. Your comment doesn&#x27;t even provide a prime facie argument against some forms of government intervention. E.g., we could let the market determine prices but mandate that fab equipment suppliers go to the front of the line.<p>2. Price is probably a red herring anyways. I&#x27;m willing to bet that fab equipment suppliers are losing out not on price negotiations, but on <i>volume</i> negotiations. I.e., they might even be willing to pay more -- even much more -- than other users, but can&#x27;t buy in massive quantities so don&#x27;t go to the front of the line.<p>3. Is there any (legal) mechanism at the moment that prevents chip makers from increasing prices?<p>4. Fab equipment producers are small consumers of chips but have such a disproportionately high impact on the rate of future supply. In the midst of a global shortage, we could straight up socialize 0.00...01% of chips produced every year and hand them out for free to fab equipment manufacturers <i>without even effecting the short-term price dynamics</i>. I&#x27;m not actually advocating this, but the assertion that earmarking a small number of chips for a particular high-value use fundamentally skew the market in the short-term is probably false.<p>5. Even if markets can eventually work in this case -- and for the record I&#x27;m convinced that this is a perfect example of contract negotiators being extremely myopic -- market dynamics have non-O(1) time complexity and the chip shortage is wrecking havoc on the real economy.<p>My comment wasn&#x27;t suggesting price controls or socializing chip fabrication. It was suggesting that we very temporarily give special treatment to a very small consumer of chips that has an outsized impact on production rate, in the midst of a global chip shortage.

            Grandparent gives the choices of ‘positive exponent growing against time’ or ‘negative exponent damping out against time’. Here we have a positive exponent damping (reducing)  the output over time, because it’s value is less than one, resulting in a negative loop gain.  The Wikipedia article linked up thread defines positive feedback as having positive loop gain, and negative feedback negative loop gain.

            In control terms it is. There’s a stable asymptote of ‘we made no machines today’ every day, until some external process breaks the dependency cycle.

            Great for whom? Wall St. or the common American? Like I said, their interests don&#x27;t necessarily align. Sure, maybe stocks were up (usually, not when Trump was threatening to shut down the government if he didn&#x27;t get his wall, though), but that didn&#x27;t trickle down to everyone and is <i>far</i> from a total picture of the economy. Also, your article doesn&#x27;t support your claim. Schumer was praising Trump for being tough on China for the sake of being tough on China, not for managing supply chains well.

            No, but the government can shoulder a larger risk than what the private sector may tolerate.<p>There&#x27;s all kinds of examples, but aerospace is a classic one. There would be no airline industry or commercial space industry if the government wasn&#x27;t willing to bear a disproportionate amount of the risk when these industries were nascent. There just wasn&#x27;t enough market demand to incentivize the private sector to do so on their own. So the govt sets up an incentive structure that brings the risk to a level where the private sector is willing to partake. The government is also generally more tolerant of longer-term scenarios than the private sector.

            This is a pretty axiomatic view that governments can never be as responsive or as efficient as markets. The more commonly accepted economic wisdom is that they are usually less efficient and responsive than free market forces operating under ideal conditions. There is a lot of room for market failures, inefficiencies and temporal dynamics to change the balance. The are plenty of examples of government regulatory bodies that have a nice anchoring effect on the relevant markets. The Federal Reserve Bank, for example, responds quickly to changing market conditions, looks at the data and intervenes at a speed that keeps pace with the rapidly fluctuating market it regulates.

            The Federal Reserve hardly responds to market conditions. Their free and open printing of money is arguably the greatest risk to our economy.

            I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;natural boom and bust cycles&quot; but credit cycles and other financial cycles are just a property of the money system. Alternative money systems do not have this property.<p>The cycles only make sense because people like and want them. I.e. they love the scarcity of money. For example, in a depression the return on money is greater than the return on labor, people logically flock to money rather than labor even though real wealth is eroding as people stop working.

            I was looking for a comment like this:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rootbug.com&#x2F;how-could-it-be-solved&#x2F;taxing-money-through-inflation-making-saving-less-tempting&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rootbug.com&#x2F;how-could-it-be-solved&#x2F;taxing-money-throu...</a><p>Let me put it in my own words:<p>If republicans think that unemployment benefits compete with private businesses on labor, then I get to think that 0% interest money competes with labor for capital.<p>The fundamental problem is that the 0% lower bound combined with a deposit guarantee represents not only a minimum wage for capital. It also presents a job guarantee. A minimum wage doesn&#x27;t guarantee you a job.<p>So yes, the Federal Reserve is not responding to market conditions at all. It&#x27;s artificially holding up interest rates at zero or above. This is causing massive distortions in the economy that can only be fixed by a swiss-army knife of policies. Among one of the needed responses is &quot;free and open printing of money&quot;. The world economy is already flirting with disinflation (a reduction in inflation). If you don&#x27;t have negative interest rates you will need a whole load of &quot;money printing&quot; to keep the system standing in place.<p>The assumption that a scarce money system (i.e. guaranteed non negative interest) has a fixed velocity of money is absurd. Put interest at -5% and just watch everyone withdraw cash from their bank account. The velocity of cash would be basically be zero and the velocity of money on bank accounts would be extremely high. As the government is doing deficit spending all the money just piles up somewhere and ends up doing nothing. QE is even worse because you cannot spend centralbank reserves to buy groceries.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;j5l_Oeg6kMo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;j5l_Oeg6kMo</a><p>Ok, let&#x27;s do the negative interest thing. It sounds like a big hassle right? Just think about the benefits: The first step after negative interest ratess would be to adjust the inflation target to 0% meaning perfect price stability. Actually, you wouldn&#x27;t target inflation at all because the negative interest rate completely replaces the need for inflation. You would target the CPI itself meaning your goal as the government would be to maintain a CPI of 100 for all eternity. Any deviation would become inexcusable. Meanwhile today inflation is a hack to make a broken money system work.<p>Don&#x27;t blame the fed. Blame the money.

            I think you&#x27;re right, but it&#x27;s partly because we weren&#x27;t couching the quest for efficiency in the context of risk.<p>I might be more time efficient by speeding everywhere, but that efficiency gain needs to be understood in terms of how much additional risk it incurs.

            This assumes an efficient global market, without interference from other state actors.<p>If other countries are implementing protectionist policies, like keeping semiconductors for themselves or supplying other nations first to curry favors or improved relationships, for example, it might be in another nations interest to increase fab capacity with its borders to avoid being vulnerable to those political and diplomatic factors.

            Toyota pioneered the &quot;Toyota Way&quot;, which is now known as Lean or JIT manufacturing.  JIT is famously susceptible to disruption from natural disasters.  Over the short term, between disruptions, JIT tends to be more profitable than the alternatives.   Over the long term, the market rewards companies that can handle disruptions.  Basically, to answer your question, the market is punishing JIT MFG and rewarding resilience.  Companies are watching it happen and learning from it.  One indication of this is the current increase in inflation.  Companies are switching from 1 month of inventory to 6-12, which is making suppliers scramble and driving up prices.<p>I am by no means against government intervention.  Companies have short memories, and market forces will force eventually pressure a return to JIT.  But now is the exact wrong time to intervene.

            The article notes that Toyota avoided &quot;just-in-time&quot; supply for chips, and has benefited for a while from this. Their stockpile just ran out.<p>&gt; New cars often include dozens of microchips but Toyota benefited from having built a larger stockpile of chips - also called semiconductors - as part of a revamp to its business continuity plan, developed in the wake of the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami a decade ago.

Their people in the Kerry Plaza were prohibited by their contract to even show their employment for Apple in their LinkedIn profiles. Their Shenzhen RnD centre is where AirPods were developed, along with many other iPad, and iPhone sub-assemblies. Apple&#x27;s VR goggles project had its start in Shenzhen as well.<p>Amazon had no presence whatsoever in China besides a failed Chinese Amazon.com launch. They left China, and then returned to move the whole of their Kindle, and Echo device development to Shenzhen. Now they are working on something rather cryptic there. Some suggest VR goggles of their own design.<p>Facebook... absolutely bizarrely opened their RnD centre in Shenzhen amid the COVID, just a floor below Google I heard.<p>Dell, Microsoft, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Intel — all conventional hardware makers were here since nineties, but I think they really doubled down on China recently as well too, to one up the dotcom upstarts in hardware.

            But agricultural studies are working as intended?<p>The U.S. government has decided that it&#x27;s in our national security interest to remain a net exporter of crops.<p>If World War III broke out and all the borders shut down, America would still be able to feed herself.

            Can you elaborate on your point?<p>While I agree there are definitively some downsides to ag subsidies, I think the real question is if the interventionist downsides are worse than the non-subsidized downsides. As bad as they are, I&#x27;m not sure that incentivizing unhealthy food is actual worse than famine.

            That&#x27;s one way to look at it. Another is that those are side effects of having stable and affordable food prices. The solution being talked about in this thread of simply raising prices would literally starve people to death if applied to that case.

            &gt; Then what&#x27;s the solution?<p>Time and capital investment. It&#x27;s like this generation of people have never heard of production and supply disruptions, and were oblivious to such things being possible. Frankly, this doesn&#x27;t matter very much, it&#x27;s not a critical situation.<p>The auto market malfunctioning short-term due to a pandemic doesn&#x27;t present a strong argument for government intervention. Tesla can&#x27;t make batteries fast enough, there isn&#x27;t enough supply, its restraining their auto production, the government must step in and fix the problem! It&#x27;s nonsense. The government should not step in every time there is a short-term problem in a market.<p>Toyota won&#x27;t sell as many vehicles. So what.<p>I know, I know, but what if people have to make due with a three year old vehicle. What if they have to suffer and endure those vehicles being made to last for five or six years. Ten years! The horror.<p>Toyota won&#x27;t die. Time will pass, during which necessary investments and adjustments will be made. Supply will be increased. The problem will be fixed. It&#x27;s as simple as some time and capital investment. The companies that maneuver the best will come out ahead, gaining an advantage on their competitors. And the world keeps on spinning.<p>Toyota has generated something like $90-$100 billion in operating income the past five years. They have the resources - and then some - to fix the problem. If they choose not to or can&#x27;t that&#x27;s their own incompetence, their competitors will eat their lunch. Never feel bad for a corporation earning $20 billion a year. If they can&#x27;t get their production corrected, someone else will figure it out and reap the benefits.<p>It does not matter as much as is being portrayed. This is not an important problem and does not warrant the government burning its time and resources to step in and fix (assuming they can help at all). Governments have a lot of other far more important things to be focused on.

            That sounds nice, but a singular entity within a government, entrusted with the necessary power to regulate the relevant parts of the market without too much coordination overhead with other government entities, is actually much more efficient at resolving market inefficiencies than the free market. Case in point: production of vaccines.<p>That&#x27;s also obvious: the inefficiency in governments originates largely from coordination overhead between many competing entities with overlapping responsibilities. Self-regulating systems like markets do not eliminate that overhead, they just use other means of coordination that trade some of the complexity overhead for a time overhead - instead of having to coordinate a complex set of rules, you now have to give the system enough time to &quot;find&quot; its stable state. But when time is of the essence, an intelligent, singular entity without the need for coordination with anyone besides the entities to be regulated can always outcompete the self-regulating system when it comes to short-term stabilization (though not necessarily with regard to long-term stabilization, but that&#x27;s not the issue here).

            The US government regulated critical parts of the supply chain of raw materials and preproducts in order to ensure that US manufacturers have no sourcing problems. It then compelled the manufacturers into exclusively servicing the US purchase contracts first before fulfilling competing contracts from other global buyers with any of the finished product produced on US territory.<p>I&#x27;d call that quite a lot of &quot;market management&quot;. But as everyone could see it resulted in the fastest vaccination ramp-up worldwide (excluding Israel, which was a bit faster, but is also much smaller than the US and which had its own way to get &quot;preferred&quot; access to vaccine produced in the EU).

            They can&#x27;t even manage a trivial task like maintaining roads and bridges properly.<p>You could have hardly picked a worse example than the government roads system (including our thousands of dilapidated bridges), which is in absolutely horrific condition and is a humiliating example for the government. It&#x27;s the opposite of a good example.<p>That&#x27;s all due to lack of funding, one might suggest? They&#x27;re not lacking for funds. They spent our money on blowing up other countries and then (occasionally) attempting to rebuild them. Vietnam, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Korea and 497 other cases of meddling and foreign adventurism. There rests $10 trillion in infrastructure money. No, they have had plenty of our money to spend, and they chose to squander it.<p>What ever would we do if we didn&#x27;t have those hyper incompetent clowns to manage our roads.<p>GPS is trivial.

            This take might have some hindsight bias.<p>While a lot of industry seem obvious and worth the investment today, when they were nascent that wasn&#x27;t the case. Would GPS exist if private companies had to fund the rocket and satellite research just to tell you where you are on the map? Or would the aircraft industry exist?<p>Most of those types of high-risk, nebulous reward (at least on short-to-near-term timescales) industries are predicated on government investment.

            it certainly does have hindsight bias, on both sides. The Satellite TV and Radio industries spend the money to launch.<p>Back in the 90s (during the age of early GPS), Motorola (iirc) tried to launch a satellite phone company too.<p>NASA isn&#x27;t that big of a customer.

            &gt;<i>The Satellite TV and Radio industries spend the money to launch.</i><p>Correct, but this is an after-the-fact understanding. They spend money to launch <i>now</i> because the industries are no longer nascent and being launched on platforms designed around government investment. The key to my point is that the government spends money when the industries are young and risky to develop platforms. If those platforms work out that helps the private sector have a less risky path down the road. This is why telecoms weren&#x27;t rushing to develop rockets in the 1960s.<p>&gt;<i>NASA isn&#x27;t that big of a customer.</i><p>This is very much the same thing. Early on, NASA was really the only SpaceX customer and NASA helped keep them from going bankrupt [1]. In addition, NASA made early launches more palatable because the government is self-insured. Government contracts help usher along young, risky companies until they could have a less risky business model that the private sector feels more comfortable with. It&#x27;s very similar to aerospace development over 100 years ago with the Wright brothers and Curtis vying for Army contracts. Without those contracts, they are as much hobbyists as entrepreneurs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ndtv.com&#x2F;offbeat&#x2F;elon-musk-says-nasas-1-5-billion-contract-had-saved-spacex-from-going-broke-2502210" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ndtv.com&#x2F;offbeat&#x2F;elon-musk-says-nasas-1-5-billio...</a>

            Toyota was one of the few (only?) companies to keep a large stockpile of chips on hand to continue production in case of a supply interruption.

            After the 2011 earthquake they came to the conclusion that for some hard to source parts you have to keep a big stockpile.<p>Basically if a part can only be produced by one or two parties there is too much risk of that source going away and disrupt everything else. This also applies all the way down the chain so if you got part A that can be made by 20 contractors but if all of those contractors depend on the same source then that part is also on the list of &quot;stockpile this part enough to get over most disruptions&quot;

            It is different to keep large inventory of everything because you are inefficient and can&#x27;t function without it and different to decide to stockpile specific parts because of perceived potential risks while being efficient with everything else.

            One big advantage of low inventories is you do not have to fix or trash lots of parts if they were made out of spec. In the case of chips the odds are they are all good. It is just the cost of ownership but not the cost of refitting.

            It <i>should</i> go without saying that there are nuances in implementation.  What I&#x27;m describing here is a fundamental tradeoff of JIT systems.  If you get the wrong thing delivered it throws a bigger wrench into things because you don&#x27;t have the buffer.  Can you make this rare enough that the amortized cost is low enough to make JIT overall cheaper?  Of course, that&#x27;s why everyone does JIT.

            &gt; If you get the wrong thing delivered it throws a bigger wrench into things because you don&#x27;t have the buffer.<p>JIT, in Lean, does <i>not</i> mean no buffer, it means as little of a buffer as you can get away with. If you have issues with delivery like this on a regular basis, then you&#x27;d increase the buffer size (at least temporarily) and also take your suppliers to task for sending the wrong thing over and over.<p>The buffer size should be increased if any upstream supply issues exist that regularly cause a shortage. Ideally, you should address those issues themselves, but if you have and they can&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t) be fixed then you increase your buffer to accommodate reality. However, the shortage is itself a signal. Too high an inventory permits supply issues to persist without being addressed for a long time <i>because</i> you never get the signal about the issues with them (the downstream production slowdowns).

            &gt; JIT, in Lean, does not mean no buffer, it means as little of a buffer as you can get away with.<p>Yeah, spot on. One of my college professors used to compare it to a river with rocks in it. If you want to safely sail on the river, you can either a) keep the water level high enough or b) remove the rocks. In a production system inventories&#x2F;buffers are the water level and variance is the rocks. The philosophy of JIT is to remove as much variance from your system as possible so you can lower your buffers. If you have identified areas of high variance you&#x27;re forced to keep buffers until you&#x27;ve removed enough variance to lower your buffers.

            &gt; JIT, in Lean, does not mean no buffer, it means as little of a buffer as you can get away with.<p>Eh... I would argue that JIT means making that buffer someone else&#x27;s problem.<p>I was doing EDI at a logistics firm that contracted with Seagate who provided HDDs to Hitachi for their SANs around 2006. Hitachi was doing JIT for their manufacturing, Seagate however was just speculating Hitachi&#x27;s demand and literally stockpiled HDDs in this firms warehouses geolocated next to Hitachi&#x27;s factories.<p>We would pickup stock from Seagate and ship it to these warehouses where they would remain Seagate&#x27;s property until Hitachi requested it, then we would simply transfer ownership to Hitachi.<p>Interestingly, we used rail shipping as a buffer to reduce warehouse size by sending freight on slow&#x2F;cheap&#x2F;indirect routes.

            In this case you have two buffers. Seagate&#x2F;you have a buffer for the outflow based on expected consumption rate. Hitachi almost certainly has some buffer of their own. This is not unusual with physical goods where you have the transportation time and cost to consider (which you&#x2F;your employer took advantage of).<p>If Hitachi couldn&#x27;t consume your delivered HDDs as fast as they were delivered and anticipated any kind of delay&#x2F;disruption could ever happen, they&#x27;d have some buffer of their own.

            In this case Hitachi didn&#x27;t have a buffered supply.  The warehouses were located literally across the street.  The products were palletized at Seagate&#x27;s factory in quantities matching Hitachi&#x27;s product lines then delivered to the warehouse in a cadence closely matching Hitachi&#x27;s consumption rate.  So when Hitachi placed an order, a pallet was pulled and the ownership of the serial numbers on that pallet were transferred to Hitachi as it was delivered.<p>The logistics firm was the buffer allowing Seagate&#x27;s product rate and Hitachi&#x27;s consumption to be asymmetric in nature.

            The last bit works, as long as the slow transportation is closely controlled. I tried it once, in the end warehouse space was cheaper.<p>EDIT: What you describe sounds more like VMI, vendor managed inventory, than JIT. Both require half way reliable forecasts and collaborative planning so to worl properly. Have to agree so that both solutions tend to push inventory risk to suppliers. Done correctly, overall inventory does decrease so.

            JIT and VMI go hand-in-hand, they aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive.  Implementing JIT is to impose VMI on your suppliers.<p>The interesting thing was that Seagate avoided managing inventory by outsourcing to the logistics firm.  The stock was technically Seagate&#x27;s until it was ordered by Hitachi but the logistics company took immediate possession as pallets rolled out of the factory.<p>&gt; The last bit works, as long as the slow transportation is closely controlled.<p>It didn&#x27;t need to be controlled, just scheduled.  You knew you need x units by d.  The factory output n per week, so you could stagger shipments by way of different lines.<p>All of the inventory was tracked by serial numbers and it was interesting to watch it move because supply was often delivered to the warehouse out of order or shipments weeks apart arrived simultaneously.

            The way I used was VMI to avoid the limited flexibility of JIT, bit yes both concepts tackle the same problem. What you describe sounds like a lot of fun to run on a daily basis, would have loved to do that!

            Chips also go out of production suddenly (with only a couple years warning - which isn&#x27;t anywhere near enough time to replace them all).  thus any major manufacture has stockpiles of chips that are no longer in production that need to last until production of the widget switches to new chips and have enough left over as spare parts for existing widgets.

            &gt; Chips also go out of production suddenly (with only a couple years warning...)<p>No they don&#x27;t, automotive semiconductors suppliers have an &quot;obligation&quot; to manufacture the component for at least 15 years, which makes managing the production output planning, spare parts etc. much easier. It&#x27;s not like walking into your supermarket and finding out that your favorite brand of chocolate is no longer available.

            Some of them get that, and car manufactures have learned the hard way how important that is and so demanding it more. However there are still a lot of parts where they can&#x27;t get the 15 year supply in anything that meets the other requirements.

            Because people equal JIT with close to zero buffer inventory. JIT is basically a concept of defining the <i>correct</i> and <i>minimal</i> buffer. If that&#x27;s close zero, cool. If it&#x27;s more than zero, cool as well. It also puts a lot of emphasis on lot sizes and lead-times. No one in the right mind would implement JIT for stuff involving sea freight without buffer stock close to production.

            This is a misunderstanding of lean manufacturing. Lean is not about eliminating every stockpile, it&#x27;s about thinking through your supply needs and only stockpiling what is necessary.

            Were manufacturers stockpiling what was unnecessary before lean manufacturing? It&#x27;s an absurd notion that anybody would stockpile things without consideration of inventory costs.

            Yes, they were.<p>Think of each stage of the system, not just the components you bring in but also the partially assembled components you produce along the way as well as the finished product. US auto manufactures (in particular) had an operating method where they kept inventories high at all stages. This wasn&#x27;t entirely deliberate. They weren&#x27;t saying, &quot;We need 5000 car doors just sitting here.&quot; They were, instead, saying, &quot;We can&#x27;t stop making doors just because everything else down the line is stopped due to &lt;event&gt; so keep churning them out and pile them up.&quot; The tail end inventory of &quot;complete&quot; vehicles were sitting there due, often, to quality issues (misaligned assemblies, missing parts, whatever the reason may be).<p>So inventory piles up everywhere along the chain, which also worked because there was a large turnaround period when retooling and equipment downtime (not always planned). Because <i>Nobody Ever Gets Credit for Problems that Never Happened</i> [0] there was an underinvestment in maintenance and improvement efforts. High inventory across the line papers over this issue. Lean discourages high inventory in order to make these issues apparent so that they can get the attention that they deserve. Also, rework is viewed as waste so quality issues should be addressed when they&#x27;re discovered, not by assembling hundreds or thousands of vehicles incorrectly and then fixing them, fix the assembly line issues causing that misassembly.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;nelsonr&#x2F;www&#x2F;Repenning=Sterman_CMR_su01_.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;nelsonr&#x2F;www&#x2F;Repenning=Sterman_CMR_su01_....</a>

            Sort of, it would come down to suppliers would historically only sell in large quantities to maximize their production efficiency, so the per unit production cost would be minimized by running a long production run. But this would potentially cause scrap if the final product did not sell well to expectations or if there was a design error, and then also increased working capital as the inventory levels would spike really high with infrequent supply from the vendor instead of being more constant with more frequent replenishment.<p>And then multiply across everyone in a supply chain for a single product having to deal with waiting to receive giant parts orders from their vendors before they could start their own giant order to supply their customers.

            They did stockpile everything due to not having a plan or consider costs. That also had the strange side effect of constantly running out of parts. In some way, stuff worked by accidentally having the right stuff on hand at the right time in sufficient quantities. TPS is all about having a plan for this stuff.

            Vehicles made a massive leap forward with the introduction of electronic components - fuel injection, oxygen sensors, throttle control.

            In addition, breakdowns were a much more regular occurrence. It wasn’t unheard of for brakes to fail without warning. I hate computer-laden cars quite a bit, but as you say, cars have become much more reliable than they ever were in the past. (Written while parked in a 17 year old Toyota.)

            Ever since working on Integrated-Logistcs-Support I take issue when terms like reliability are thrown around. Because in the end it&#x27;s a result of looking at Reliability (stuff not breaking down often), Availability (stuff being functional when planned to be), Maintainability (how easily stuff can be kept functioning and repaired when broken), Supportability (how easy spares can be get) and Testability (how easy it is to find defects).<p>On that, Availability is the result of all the rest. With the important part of <i>planned</i> Availability, because that excludes stuff like planned maintenance. Arguably modern cars beat old ones in that category.

            I think that&#x27;s true. What most of us care about in cars is that they work when we want to drive them someplace <i>right now</i>, won&#x27;t leave us stuck on the side of the road, and don&#x27;t have prohibitive (time or money) planned maintenance.<p>What&#x27;s probably true is that older cars that aren&#x27;t rusted out can probably be kept running by people with the appropriate mechanical skills even in the absence of proper factory&#x2F;3rd party parts for longer than modern vehicles can. Given intact supply chains, modern vehicles are more available overall. But, to the point of the article, modern vehicles are more susceptible to lack of parts.

            True, as an owner of a car from 1982 I agree. Requires a lot more preventive maintenance, e.g. oil changes every six months or 5-6k km, but runs perfectly fine when properly maintained. Also, I cam probably fix most issues with tools carried on board on the side of road. Enough to get to a proper workshop at least, I converted it to 2WD after killing a diff and drove for 200 km that way. If you cannot do that yourself, you&#x27;re screwed so.<p>That being said, if I&#x27;d go on a 2k + mile trip I would put in some work to get the car fit for this. Looking at my dads VW camper, I&#x27;ll just fill up drinking water, maybe gas and fuel. Without a serious amount of preventive maintenance those cars do have a tendency to break down so. I guess we are just not used to this kind cars or machinery anymore.

            No it isn&#x27;t.  Survivorship bias would have been me claiming that because my cars lasted more than 50 k miles that therefore all cars did.<p>I merely added a small counter argument to the idea that cars of the period were <i>necessarily</i> short lived.

            The bias is more that we go through cars faster, generally, then they die. And once a car isn&#x27;t used anymore, it just rots away. Or it gets exported to some developing country to happily life for another couple of decades. How that would work with modern electronics, I don&#x27;t know. Probably as long as electronics don&#x27;t brick the car it should fine I guess.

            <i>The bias is more that we go through cars faster</i><p>Is that true though? Average length of car ownership is at an all-time high of over 8 years. It was under 5 years just 20 years ago. Maybe length of ownership doesn&#x27;t correlate to length of car life, but seems like a strong signal that car quality and lifespan is going up.

            The fact that clunkers can be kept running at some level for an extended period of time (especially if they&#x27;re not somewhere that the frame will simply rust out from road salt) doesn&#x27;t change the fact that what people in developed countries would consider reliable day-to-day transportation has a significantly longer life cycle than it used to.

            I can’t think of any system in a car today that doesn’t use some chip somewhere.<p>Wouldn’t even power steering use it?

Climate control vs just “AC fan on”<p>Even some ignition systems have chips that do some kind of key exchange to start the car.

            I mean yes, if you take that tautologically, since a modern car engine has a chip. But probably you could build an engine that meets modern requirements without. People forget how clever analog solutions can be. It would be a huge pain in the ass though, and take years.

            Even before EFI, almost all dirt bikes and snowmobiles built since probably the 1980s have had electronic ignition. You have to go pretty far back in time to find a vehicle of any sort with a points ignition that has no silicon&#x2F;transistorized electronics in it.

            No.  US cars got chips starting in the mid-80’s, so almost 40 years ago.<p>And they were actually much more reliable and efficient.  Fuel injection was light years ahead of carburetors.<p>And I’d argue it would be impossible to meet emissions without computer control of the engine.

            It is possible, but the cars will be taxed into oblivion, because of push to electric cars. This is nothing new in finland because nobody there buys new car anyways, and continues to recycle existing old cars. Though that will also soon become impossible due to rising taxes to get rid of the old cars.

            I just wonder how deep this goes down the line of third party suppliers. Like, I know a lot of auto manufacturers use Bosch or Siemens for their ECUs, so I would think it’s really out of their hands. Then again, maybe they have terms in the contract to force Bosch to maintain a certain inventory?

            Most auto companies don&#x27;t take delivery of chips except for managing production of a few key modules like engine controllers. Most of the chips in your car are in components made by suppliers with circuit boards often made by a second tier supplier. Combine that with many chips having no alternate and I don&#x27;t see how Toyota could really stay exempt from this problem. OTOH not every chip maker is having trouble keeping up.

            Toyota doesn&#x27;t have to physically hold the chips&#x2F;modules to accomplish they.  They have contracts with suppliers that lock in how much inventory the supplier has to have on hand, and how much supply they need locked in from their own upstream suppliers.<p>One criticism of Toyota&#x27;s production system is that they aren&#x27;t so much &quot;just in time&quot; as it sounds on the surface, rather they just force their suppliers to run the warehouse instead of them.  Which still makes sense - Toyota wants to be in the car business, not the warehouse and logistics businesses.

            Highly anecdotal, but I spoke to Bilstein about some seemingly unobtainium shocks yesterday. Pre-pandemic these part numbers were common as dirt.<p>They said their sales were up 50-60% over the last 18 mos, and that raw materials supply is down by a similar margin.<p>These are <i>shock absorbers</i>, not chips or toilet paper.<p>It seems like we&#x27;re seeing the delayed effect on supply chains over the pandemic. There is surely no value in hoarding shock absorbers, and if distributors were the hoarders, they seem to just be sitting on them, not raising prices.

            Yeah, this also makes no sense to me:<p>&gt; The Covid pandemic boosted demand for appliances that use chips, such as phones, TVs and games consoles.<p>SOCs in phones and game consoles are produced on very different processes than chips used in cars, no?

            They certainly overlap. SoCs aren&#x27;t the only chips in game consoles or other devices, different kinds of chip production have shared supply chains that themselves are struggling, SoCs used in cars aren&#x27;t necessarily that different from the ones in other appliances (e.g. NVidia Tegra X1 is used both in the Nintendo Switch and some cars, and probably a pile of other things) ...

            Hypothesis: there&#x27;s a correlation between shortage of chips made with cutting-edge processes and chips that are not, because a lot of them are made by the same companies (and the supply-chain issues are impacting <i>companies</i> not just <i>product lines</i>).

            &gt; SOCs in phones and game consoles are produced on very different processes than chips used in cars, no?<p>Yes, some of them are different. Consumer chips are not industrial norm, they have narrower environmental operating ranges.<p>The foundries producing automotive chips shifted production to consumer chips during the lockdowns, as the auto production lines were on hold. This caused supply chain disruptions. Add to that US &gt; China IP export bans and you have a black swan event.

            Much of the ECUs OEM are purchasing from Tier 1 suppliers (Denso for example - a Toyota spinoff) who are directly hit by IC shortage, so that&#x27;s why they are talking about overall supply.

            Actually, Toyota moved away from JIT after 2011 earthquake when several of it’s factories had to stop production due to lack of parts from other factories impacted by earthquake. One of the change was increased inventory levels of components.<p>Toyota is one of the last automaker to reduce production due to the current chip shortage, because they had enough chips for 18-24 months of production.<p>Edit: It seems some of Toyota factories in Southeast Asia have shutdown due to Covid spread in those countries resulting in shortage of parts supplied to factories in Japan. Reported to be 40% reduction in production.

            Relevant: <i>The Security Value of Inefficiency</i> by Bruce Schneier<p>&gt; This drive for efficiency leads to brittle systems that function properly when everything is normal but break under stress. And when they break, everyone suffers. The less fortunate suffer and die. The more fortunate are merely hurt, and perhaps lose their freedoms or their future. But even the extremely fortunate suffer — maybe not in the short term, but in the long term from the constriction of the rest of society.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;the_security_va.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;the_security_...</a>

            And it’s the same with our healthcare system and hospitals. Because they are run as businesses, hospitals are finely tuned to be mostly full most of the time. When COVID fills up 30% of your beds, it quickly overwhelms the system and it crumbles. This is why healthcare needs to be publicly owned, because robustness is necessarily inefficient, and inefficient is incompatible with capitalism.

            So new cars are going to be come more expensive due to supply limitations and in turn used cars will continue to become more expensive as they can rise to a certain % of the new car price. At the same time housing prices continue to sky rocket. Seems like not a great time for someone just stepping into adulthood and financial responsibility.

            &gt; just stepping into adulthood and financial responsibility.<p>I am older than that (40 and my wife is 35) and while we have been independent professionals for a while, we now have a 1 year old so this summer for the first time in our lives we bought a house and a car.<p>It was definitely harder to find a house (mainly less availability driving competitive bidding) and it took a little longer to find a car and we ended up having to pay MSRP.<p>However the thing I can say is - the incremental cost&#x2F;hassle of having to do these things during the pandemic supply crunch is almost irrelevant compared to having to do this stuff at all. We paid say 3% more for the car and ok maybe 10&#x2F;20% for the house than we would have otherwise, obviously that&#x27;s painful but if I was &quot;just stepping into adulthood and financial responsibility&quot; I&#x27;d look to avoid this stuff altogether.<p>EG: do you need to own a house? If you&#x27;re a single person, &quot;throwing away&quot; money on a relatively inexpensive rental might be much wiser than &quot;investing&quot; in a house in a seller&#x27;s market. Likewise, if you&#x27;re young and single then you should relatively easily (depending on where you live of course) arrange your life to not need a car. It was very easy for us in NYC, of course may be different for you.<p>The point is that in my mind, &quot;adulthood and financial responsibility&quot; don&#x27;t have to translate &quot;got my own house and car&quot; but simply &quot;making wise financial decisions given my situation&quot; so if there&#x27;s room to be flexible, be flexible.

            When I was in my early 20s, someone gave me this exact advice. I didn&#x27;t have much money and they said that real estate was too expensive and I should just invest&#x2F;rent. Fast forward to today, I paid 8x more for my small sad house than I would have then and my investments on my small amount of money didn&#x27;t make up the difference.<p>The market is so screwed up that even a crash that halved the price would still be 4 times price back then.

            Finance guy here, two things. You are looking at it in retrospect. &quot;I should have bought a house&quot; is no different than &quot;I should have bought X stock&quot; when you&#x27;re looking at the price history backwards. At the time, it could have gone up or down. EG we just bought a house, I have many reasons to expect that it could drop in value over the next bunch of years.<p>Second, you may not be doing proper calculations. I would not have - before I bought a house. Do you count property taxes, upkeep, larger water and electricity bills, possibly longer commute times&#x2F;needing a car, relative lack of mobility, air conditioner&#x2F;heating&#x2F;roofing&#x2F;siding&#x2F;repair, lawn maintenance, etc.<p>Yes sure, if I bought <i>this</i> house 10 years ago, it would have been great. But I wouldn&#x27;t know 10 years ago that I&#x27;d want this house, and for example dealing with all the above shit as a single man would have been stupid. There were also points in my life where I was very open to relocation for the right job, something home ownership would have put friction on.<p>it&#x27;s very common to think of only a pro or a con of a decision (if I bought earlier, it would have only cost X) but you&#x27;re not factoring the risk that existed at the time, nor the commitment you&#x27;re creating on yourself, not the carrying costs I described above.<p>May not be relevant to you but I feel fine about &quot;losing out&quot; on 20 years of house appreciation (if I bought at 20 not 40) because I avoided all that stuff for 20 years, too.

            &gt; It&#x27;s fucked. Buy now.<p>Ok you certainly should go for it, but I&#x27;ll give you one analysis that I have. We bought in a NYC suburb (for a bunch of reasons) and here&#x27;s what I think constitutes price risk for me.<p>At the end of the day, a house is worth what someone can and is willing to pay for it. Right now, there&#x27;s reasons the demand is high for near-NYC housing because (a) people aren&#x27;t sure they need to be near NYC long-run and don&#x27;t want to risk it (b) it&#x27;s an easiest move to make to leave the city and not go far (c) supply is low because with covid, fewer people are willing to have an open house (d) now everyone is in a rush to upsize so space is at a premium.<p>All of these are demand factors that can change. EG: (a) it may become clear in 1-2 years that permanent remote is an option for many people, relieving demand pressure on NYC and the area. (b) once people are comfortable with leaving the city they may be comfortable moving further afield. (c) the pent-up supply of folks who didn&#x27;t sell in 2020&#x2F;2021 may come to market, especially if a and b occur, causing people to want to sell before it&#x27;s &quot;too late&quot; (d) everyone who needed up upsize may have done it, relieving that pressure.<p>Also, for New York state specifically, with the number of wealthy people leaving the states, it feels inevitable that state and property taxes will rise, making all of this even less attractive.<p>And finally, interest rates are ridiculously low right now, rising rates will be a damper on prices when that happens.<p>Obviously there plenty of reasons it could also go up, but if your model is so simple &quot;it&#x27;s fucked so it&#x27;s always goes up&quot; you may get fucked too.

            NYC (esp. Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn) is pretty exceptional in the US with respect to there being no expectation of car ownership. You <i>can</i> get by in other cities out of school (especially given app-enabled rides, Zipcar, etc.) but the general expectation is car ownership.<p>As for housing, it&#x27;s perfectly normal to rent for a while until you know you want to settle down in a location for an extended period of time.

            Wonder how much of that is driven by people actually being home to answer the door when roofers knocked during Covid. Completely anecdotal but I got a new roof during the covid lock down and so did 3 of my neighbors and its mainly due to being home to answer the door and the roofer being able to get insurance to cover the cost.

            Nimbyism exists, as do more concrete constraints in urban locations but...<p>The way house prices work, often, is more or less banks determining prices via mortgage eligibility. Banks agree that a house is worth X. They lend X. That becomes the price. Buyers tend to be available.<p>People are so quick to see that credit expansion fuels price inflation in other areas, even the economy at large, but somehow diminish or ignore this with housing.<p>Obviously, supply constraints avoidable or otherwise, affect supply. In any given year though, the supply of housing does not change a ton. Where they do, you don&#x27;t tend to have wild inflation... though you do often see bigger houses.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to decouple housing from monetary policy. Housing is one of the few ways that buying power gets from A to B, where B is not a financial institution or direct spending.

            There&#x27;s huge inflation in many things related to making cars (chips, steel, shipping costs as many cars are still being shipped across the ocean, labor costs, etc.). We are likely to be in the very beginning of significant inflation cycle, with probably double digit inflation which will eventually drop to 4-4.5%. I wouldn&#x27;t expect to prices to drop any time soon, nor have 2% inflation. My bet is that fewer and fewer new cars will be sold in the next few years (3-5) with prices rising 4-10% each year.

            This is mostly just a reflection of the fact that the value of the dollar has declined precipitously over the last 18 months. Dollar prices are sticky, so it can take a bit of a shock for inflation to “kick in”, but we’ve had plenty of shocks to go around.

            I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to attribute &quot;most&quot; of this to inflation. Car prices have been rising much faster than many other components of CPI, so even in real rather than nominal dollars cars are getting more expensive.

            The stuff people actually care about has been rising faster than CPI. Cars, housing, meat, metals, lumber, etc. are all going through the roof. Inflation is a vector, and any reduction to a scalar involves taking the dot product of that vector with a weight vector. Under <i>my personal</i> weight vector, and I suspect <i>most people’s</i> weight vector, inflation is a lot higher than CPI.

            I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily NIMBY or at least my understanding of it that makes people want to keep housing prices elevated. If I buy a house at an inflated price, I want the house value to continue to rise as a large degree of my financial security is tied up in that house. My ability to refinance, take cash out and eventually even sell that house are tied to it continuing to escalate in value. In the US this is particularly true as so much of out net worth is essentially our home value. As inflation increases and peoples ability to save is even further reduced this will become even more of an issue.

            I would say it is more self perpetuating.  With housing prices growing as they are, people are saving less for retirement and putting that money into their house with a plan to cash out, move to the country, and retirement.

            What short term profits? The car industry has among the lowest margins in the entire economy.<p>Moreover the chips were never outsourced. Toyota never made its own chips, nor is it feasible to. You seem to have some sort of idealized view where a company internally manufactures everything it needs starting from raw materials.

            Now that the effects have been felt, yes.  But not a few decades ago when the majority were enjoying cheaper goods.  Even now, I do not see broad support for tariffs in order to bring production back to the country.

            It&#x27;s a bit too easy to blame this only on Wall Street. First of all companies have outsourced their production facilities to lower production costs. The parties benefiting from this were:<p>- shareholders (more profit)<p>- consumers (lower prices)<p>Second, you could say shareholders == Wall Street, but you could just as well say that shareholders are pension holders, banks, insurances and small private investors. All of these simply want to have return on their investment that is as high as possible. If that&#x27;s good or bad is an interesting question, but the bottom line is that very few people are without blame here.

            Obviously most people can’t do this but a family member was recently approached by the dealer who sold him his most recent work truck.  He’s driven like 30k miles on it in the past 2 years and it was a $75k Chevy diesel.  Dealer offered him $90k to buy it back from him (to sell to someone else) and my family member said “Sure”.  So he made $15k on an asset that should have lost 1&#x2F;2 its value by now.  Obviously rare and hard to take advantage of but some people are absolutely capitalizing on the weirdness.

            Perhaps, but it&#x27;s not uncommon for these places buying new-off-the-lot high end trucks (my family members&#x27; included) to have a dozen+ vehicles at their disposal.  He&#x27;s planning on using his 5-year old similar HD truck until the market thaws a bit, but it&#x27;s also overkill for most everything he does. One of the many work vans his business owns can likely do 95% of the work. They&#x27;re mostly just buying the big ones for clout and due to generous tax writeoffs.

            yeah.  That might work out, but my investments are diversified more.   I have real estate in the form of my house.  I have stocks and bonds in my 401k.  I have government in my social security. They are completely separate, so if any one fails I&#x27;m still okay.  (well if the government fails I&#x27;m probably in trouble no matter what, but social security is limited at best)

            That&#x27;s assuming you have the cash-flow to float the new loan. If you bought the home 5+ years ago, that might be true, but for anybody who bought recently, that&#x27;s probably not an option.

            I capitalized on it by buying a new car and selling my old one. I sold a 3 year old camaro for $1000 less than I paid for it. I didn&#x27;t get very much off MSRP of the new car, but I got way more value from a three year old camaro than I ever expected to get.

            What do you mean I can&#x27;t capitalize on the upside?<p>Sure, my purchase costs went up some, but no where close to the additional value I got over normal for my sale. Put it this way, I paid a few hundred dollars, maybe a thousand dollars more for the car than I would normally, but I sold my old car for thousands more than I normally would have been able too.<p>That&#x27;s capitalizing on the upside for sure.

            Used cars used to be worth x% of a new car.<p>Today, they are worth x+y% of a new car.<p>If you trade up now, you will pay less for the new car than if you traded up two years ago.<p>Similar situation for houses. Even if we assume all houses have inflated by the same rate, you can still downsize and cash out. Your existing $600K house is inflated 25% and you can sell for $750k. You downsize to a $400k house which is inflated to $500k. You oversold for $150k, but only overpaid by $100k and you pocket the difference.

            For anyone with a small commute I’d recommend this too. Our Yuba (spicy curry) has around 3000km on it over 2.5 years, is going strong, and I’ll still be commuting ~30km per week over the next year with it taking my 4 year old to daycare then going to work. I’ll likely continue commuting with him on it to kindergarten and perhaps early grade school.<p>It wasn’t cheap initially ($7000 CAD), but the cost per km drops enormously every year while the bike still rides as well as ever. The kids have all loved it, too. My youngest is disappointed when we drive places - he wants to walk or ride all year.<p>We do have a temperate climate which helps. Our cold days in winter are typically around 5 degrees outside of cold snaps, but even then we rarely dip below 0.<p>It’s a major quality of life improvement for us. They’re amazing grocery getters, you don’t get all sweaty on them, kids tend to love it, and they’re quite a bit easier to buy, maintain, and park than a car.<p>We went with the spicy curry because of its insane cargo capacity (we’ve used it for its full capacity many times, especially while bike camping), but you can spend far less if you don’t need to carry that weight.

            In the US city that I live in, cars get stolen an awful lot too. And not just puffers (cars left with the keys in the ignition to warm up on a cold day) -- I&#x27;ve heard of plenty of locked recent-year cars stolen from private locked garages with no keys at all. I believe car theft is up at least 500% from pre-covid.<p>And that&#x27;s to say nothing of the opportunistic catalytic converter thefts if you park your car on the street overnight.

            Most of these thefts utilize &quot;relay attacks&quot; that simulate the key being in close proximity to the car, using directional antennas to interrogate the key that&#x27;s sitting in the house and then relay it back to the car. The solution is to disable the proximity feature, but that&#x27;s inconvenient.

            Where I live I&#x27;d guess the rate is 100 bikes stolen for every car.<p>With a bike you don&#x27;t expect it to be there after locking it in the street for more than 15 minutes. I don&#x27;t know anybody personally whose car was stolen.

            Come on, we all know this problem and we all know the solution. It&#x27;s probably red-circuits that we are talking about here. We&#x27;ve all been there: you have your yellow belts full of green-circuits, but the red ones are just so much more complex. You need to set up the entire oil production chain for that, which is tedious and you probably rushed it just &#x27;get a few red circuits so I can get my electric furnace&#x27;...<p>I say, take a step back, take some time and really automate plastic-bar production (yes, even the oil wells and refineries, and don&#x27;t just put rocks in a container, belt them over there like a grown-up)<p>Only after producting enough for a full red belt, should you continue expanding into other branches, like robots and faster belts.<p>Don&#x27;t they teach this stuff anymore?

            Factorio is a nice and simplistic (and fun, for a while) way to demonstrated many aspects of software and product development.<p>You go through basic product planning and design, first quick MVP, then some feedback loops where you recognize some needed design changes, etc.  Then once you have it figured out, you want more.<p>So you start scaling up.  That scaling often necessitates refactoring, because it necessitates space and time management (no sense having a bottleneck in your system which limits your growth potential).<p>Then you have the aliens which represent unexpected problems and failures.<p>A while back someone posted about playing Factorio with job candidates as a way to see how they thing and solve problems.  This is probably much better than most tech interviews.  If you can be decent at Factorio, you can probably be pretty decent as a software developer.

            Inflation is just when prices go up, for whatever reason. Increased supply of money can cause it (and does more often than not), but decreased supply can also do that as it moves the price equilibrium. Unfortunately we have a bit of both at the moment, money supply shot up and lots of supply chains slowed down.

            No, inflation has to do with the price of goods and services. Inflation is defined as &quot;a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money&quot;.<p>Inflation can be caused by many things: reduced supply, increased demand, expectation of future price increases, degradation in the quality&#x2F;desirability of alternative products (eg bond yields), and, yes, an increase in the amount of dollars chasing an asset class&#x2F;product&#x2F;service.<p>Re: your original question, to be a bit pedantic, the supply of money <i>on its own</i> cannot cause inflation in consumer goods except via extremely odd channels (e.g., inflation expectations). A trillion dollars sitting in a bank account has approximately no effect on prices. Like a bullet in a chamber, money at rest has no effect on consumers&#x27; experience of inflation until it&#x27;s propelled forward.<p>But it&#x27;s important not to conflate causes with definitions. Also, attributing causes of inflation to particular instances of inflation is often <i>extremely</i> and <i>inherently</i> political. The inflation we&#x27;ve seen in consumer goods is a complex phenomenon with many disparate causes. Beware of anyone selling you a &quot;just-so&quot; story for the cause of inflation in a few dozen disconnected goods and services.<p>Especially if that story aligns perfectly with their ideology&#x2F;product&#x2F;investment&#x2F;political campaign.<p>And even more especially if they start the story by conflating <i>one possible cause</i> of inflation with the very definition of the thing.

            There is really three types of inflation:

3. Expectation of inflation driving higher prices and this inflation itself

            Kind of both? If I were to come up with a formula, I&#x27;d say &#x27;prices = GDP &#x2F; SupplyOfGoods&#x27;, where GDP is just &#x27;MoneySupply * MoneyVelocity&#x27;.<p>If supply goes down, prices go up. If money supply grows, prices go up. If money velocity (number of times money changes hands in a given period) goes down, prices go down, etc.<p>(It&#x27;s worth noting that in 2020 when money supply exploded, money velocity fell by a lot, which is why GDP fell, and why there wasn&#x27;t that much inflation)<p>edit: s&#x2F;inflation&#x2F;prices&#x2F;

            Inflation is the rise in costs for goods.<p>If the supply of these chips causes a loss in supply of in demand items, like cars, then it will cause an increase in the price of cars.<p>The thoughts are that this is temporary, until the components that are in low supply can catch up and meet the demand.<p>But if the lack of supply lasts for too long then people become used to the increase price and manufacturers can just keep the price there at the inflated price. Now it&#x27;s permanent inflation. Or that can happen if the supply doesn&#x27;t keep up with the demand.

            It&#x27;s is often talked about that way: Wikipedia at least defines it as a general price increase. And that still gives you many of the same effects as a money-supplu-triggered inflation. Many annuities are worth less. The dollars in a savings account are worth less. The minimum wage becames worth less...

            People think of inflation like they think of the oceans. If the ice caps melt and water melts in, the shore lines from New York to Tokyo rise slightly. If you track this rise, that&#x27;s inflation. That&#x27;s not how it works, and it&#x27;s not what the CPI tracks. Inflation is much more analogous to inland water, you know, lakes and rivers.<p>If you give the bottom 80% of the income distribution more money, they will spend it right away like a river. If you give the 81-90%, portion of it will be saved in their lake(say, a 401k) and they will spend some of it. And if you give the top 10% more money, they save all of it in their reservoir.<p>The way that we have been introducing new money into the system is not by melting ice in the middle of the ocean. We also haven&#x27;t been raining all over. The key way that new money has been introduced over the past 50 years is by lowering the interest rate. When you lower the interest rate, what happens is that people refinance, and suddenly they can pay less, but quickly realize, oh, I can also borrow more, so they do.<p>I&#x27;ll show you a few numbers, which I got by going to the zillow housing affordability page with default settings. I only modified the interest rate, all other values stay the same.<p>Year | Average Interest Rate 30 Year Fixed | Home you can Afford<p>1981 | 18.39 | $124,797<p>1991 | 9.00 | $200,862<p>2010 | 6.26 | $244,531<p>2020 | 2.67 | $328,569<p>And so what we see people and REITs and companies doing is taking out larger and larger loans, and putting those dollars into assets. Companies take out a bond and buy back their own stock. And why wouldn&#x27;t they, it&#x27;s profitable because the environment makes it so. And that money flows throughout the system. We can track the inflow of all of this money by looking at say.. the M2. This seems to be the crux of your point, if the amount of money in the M2 has gone up by 40x since 1971, why is inflation not out of control?<p>The CPI is a measure for inflation that does not track the oceans water level. The M2 tracks that, and as you can see the M2 is out of control. The CPI doesn&#x27;t track stock purchases. If the CPI were to track stocks weighted at 1971 levels, inflation WOULD be out of control. The CPI tracks, specifically, an average of tangible items that the bottom 80% spends their money on. Therefore the inflation number is based on the height of certain rivers. Now that&#x27;s an important figure to keep in mind, after all if you get inflation in that bracket and income isn&#x27;t rising, you quickly run into a revolution. And so that&#x27;s what the FED has found, if you track the CPI you get the perfect amount of heating to boil the frog without them noticing.<p>But when you introduce money into the system by lowering interest rates, you are in effect giving the money in proportion to the assets already owned. Someone bought that home in 1981, and someone with the same exact income would bid 328k for it today. You basically tripled(and it was a leveraged sale, so 15x!) that home owners asset, without any need to compare anything else, like actual income rises, or for instance SF has moved upmarket which would also effect prices. And so if you don&#x27;t have much assets, it&#x27;s a desert. If you do, it&#x27;s a rain forest. And because the wealthy already have all that they want, demand for those items that the bottom 80% spend their money on doesn&#x27;t change. So the supply and demand of those items don&#x27;t change. So the CPI value stays the same. But money was introduced. If you take a look at the velocity of the M2, the M2V, you can see this take place. The wealthy get the gains of the new M2 dollars, and store it away. The more dollars created, the lower the velocity.<p>The lower the velocity, the lower inflation. But that rain is being stored in the reservoirs. If inflation causes stored wealth to lose value it&#x27;s like a dam bursts and the wealthy start to spend and not save their money, it starts as a trickle and ends in a tsunami.

            Inflation has to do with purchasing power of a dollar decreasing. I would argue that inflation is something measured at the scale of the entire economy, and you can&#x27;t say much about inflation looking at a single commodity, or even a single sector.

            Supply and demand change is what increases or decreases costs. If demand don&#x27;t adapt, there will be inflation to force it to adapt :)

            My guess it that it is like a refinery, building the factory takes too long with a  large capital outlay. For instance, it may take a year or two to build and cost (let&#x27;s guess) $500M. Now in that time, let&#x27;s say all the existing players ramp back up (or expand!!) and there is no shortage. You now are producing chips that are cheaper elsewhere and it is hard to recoup your investment. Also, you may be limited on where you can find people with expertise in this area.

            The minimum cost of entry is in the hundreds of millions to billions, it&#x27;s not especially environmentally friendly, and you&#x27;re competing against what would normally be fully-paid-off old production lines from the incumbents.<p>There&#x27;s a thriving small business <i>design</i> industry, but the manufacturing is a classical capital-intensive manufacturing business that also requires very specialist staff.

            In theory you could wire up an old pentium or 386 and program it to do the same thing some of these chips do but you have the same problem there. No on has a 5M supply of 386s just sitting around in good condition.

            As a chip supplier, I&#x27;d be feeling a lot of pressure right now.  In the short term you can squeeze and the tail can wag the dog for a bit.  But longer term this opens the door wide open for new competitors in the market and &#x2F; or vertical integration.

A lot of automotive parts are still on 20+ year old nodes. 90nm to 130 or even 180nm. I would guess those are not the parts experiencing shortages though. So that leaves the fancy stuff. Bummer if a car can&#x27;t be built because the infotainment SoC can&#x27;t be obtained because it&#x27;s competing for production with crypto mining GPUs.

            &gt; But longer term this opens the door wide open for new competitors in the market and &#x2F; or vertical integration.<p>Not really. Chip fabrication requires <i>enormous</i> upstart cost - IIRC, TSMC plans with something like 10-20 billion $ - and a lot of time, to the tune of three years at least (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pr.tsmc.com&#x2F;english&#x2F;news&#x2F;2033" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pr.tsmc.com&#x2F;english&#x2F;news&#x2F;2033</a>). There are not many companies in the world who have that amount of cash lying around, and even the ones who do like Apple still resort to using TSMC.<p>Not to mention it&#x27;s not just the machines from ASML and a host of other vendors plus the cost of building factory-sized ultra clean rooms, but you also need the expert staff trained to operate the entire setup <i>and</i> a lot of fine tuning of parameters which are closely guarded secrets...

            IT doesn&#x27;t have to be. You can be producing chips in a month if you are willing to pay.  A clean room can be created, and the process of making of making chips one at a time in labor intensive processes is known.  Just that nobody is willing to pay $50k each for their chips, and you need to get that price to pay for all the skilled labor to make a chip one at a time in a lab.<p>It takes years to setup a fab, but in the end it is a lot more cost effective, which is nobody is bothering to do the manual process even though we know it will work.

            That makes no sense. I wonder what they mean by &quot;fake&quot; chips? Are they simply not placing the chip on the board, or are they using a footprint compatible different chip (unlikely), or are they completely redesigning the board with another chip which has much better availability?

            Presumably they are building cars but leave entire modules out, and then fit them later as supply arrives. Has some benefits over stopping production, if you can afford to have a stockpile of cars around.

            On one hand, Toyota buys so many chips that their supplier will probably prioritize their orders.<p>On the other hand, Tesla is tiny compared to Toyota but is probably more flexible and can adapt faster, e.g by using alt chips with new firmware and by using fewer chips per vehicles (to be proven, but we know Model Y has half the number of ECUs of Mach E &#x2F; ID.4 for instance).<p>Also, without dealers, Tesla could better manage their build-to-order system and pricing (to push customers towards high margin vehicles and forgo volume growth while the shortage continues)

            I was speaking to a car dealer client the other week and heard some funny stories, like selling off cheap batches of vans with various non-essential electronics missing - just holes in the dash - and the promise that units would be available to fit later.

            Cars are not a large market compared to cell phones and other users of ships.  Cars are louder than the rest, but not bigger.<p>They typical car lasts 10-15 years.  Cell phones about 2.  More people have a cell phone than a car.  Sure the car has more chips, but not by enough to make them bigger than phones.  (Phones and cars mostly don&#x27;t use the same process)

            &lt;rolls eyes&gt;<p>The edge between manufacturers in any given measurable attribute of vehicle performance is far, far smaller than a bunch of screeching fanboys on the internet would have you believe.  If it weren&#x27;t you&#x27;d see far less diversity of vehicles on the road.<p>The humvee is also used by militaries all around the world.  It&#x27;s not known for particularly great reliability.  Militaries have a much difference set of objectives when it comes to labor vs supply chain complexity vs cost than civilian entities and individuals do.<p>Poor countries in Africa and the middle east use Toyotas a lot for the same reason they still use 7.62 intermediate cartridges a lot.  It&#x27;s what they have, it&#x27;s what their supply chains are tuned for.  It does the job they need, not necessarily with maximal efficiency but well enough they can&#x27;t justify the cost of switching.<p>Meanwhile in the civilian market Toyotas cost more, don&#x27;t do good incentives&#x2F;rebates and financing is more limited.  This drives people on a budget to other brands.  This means Toyotas wind up in the hands of people who treat them proportionally nicer.  A Tacoma rolls off the lot and into an upscale garage.  A Colorado rolls off the dealer lot and into a commercial fleet where it will be driven by a bunch of people who aren&#x27;t paid enough to care.  A Camry will have one ass in one seat for the first 100k and it will go from home to work and home to work.  An Altima will spend its first 100k dragging a family of four all of the places they need to go.  A Sienna&#x27;s first owner will go to home Depot, buy 3000lb of pavers and rent the truck to drive it home.  A Town and Country&#x27;s first owner will put that in the van without thinking twice.<p>See what I&#x27;m getting at here?  Being expensive up front means that only people who can afford to be nice to things get their hands on them, at least initially, that means the vehicles rack up more miles and years before they see hard use.  Any vehicle not fundamentally flawed to begin with can look reliable in the hands of these people.  I can present other examples of this if Toyota is too emotional of a topic for people to discuss.<p>Also it should go without saying that we&#x27;re talking in broad generalizations here.<p>I do agree with you that the scale difference between Tesla and Toyota is massive and comparison between them is silly.

            &gt; Or was that not the implication of your comparison?<p>The implication of my post is Toyota operates on a different scale than Tesla, and due to insufficient time having passed since the advent of Tesla, a claim cannot yet be made.  I referenced Toyota because of its objectively highly ranked reliability based on resale price and famously low maintenance costs.

But I am simply stating that the data for ICE vehicles is far longer and the dataset larger, especially for Toyota and other reputable brands, to make a conclusive claim that Tesla’s reliability (and even maintenance) is less over the whole life of the vehicle.<p>Although I do not doubt that it is possible for electric vehicles to achieve this claim, and maybe Tesla already has.

            The tone of GP is poor, but yes, the paint is really important if you want your car to last more than 5 years, especially if you live near the sea. And if you only take your car out on weekend and summers and can not put your car in a garage, a poor paint job will cost you even more.

            Why is it not affecting new car pricing as dramatically? And why would that continue? Used car prices cannot surpass new car prices surely, so at some point new car prices will be raised because of the low supply and high demand, or new car orders won&#x27;t be fulfilled for months later

            Used cars have surpassed new car prices in the past.  Generally because new cars can&#x27;t actually be bought at any price.  A car today is sometimes worth more than a better car that doesn&#x27;t exit.

            That&#x27;s not really the usual concept of &quot;inflation&quot;. Every commodity fluctuates in price. Inflation is when the price of a unit of money falls. Conceptually, it&#x27;s very easy to distinguish &quot;cars cost more dollars because cars are more expensive&quot; from &quot;cars cost more dollars because dollars are cheaper&quot;. In practice, it&#x27;s difficult to measure the value of a dollar. But in general, inflation looks more like the price of everything going up, and less like the price of cars going up.<p>(Currently, a lot of different prices <i>are</i> going up, and current inflation is high. But you can&#x27;t just point to Toyota raising prices and say &quot;See? This is what inflation looks like!&quot; That is what inflation looks like, but it&#x27;s also what not-inflation looks like.)

            What are these chips and what is preventing us from scaling up capacity? I’m not challenging that it’s difficult, but the reporting seems shoddy.

            Here’s a good rundown: it ultimately all comes back to chip fabs being huge operations with massive upfront costs which makes them sensitive to both the pandemic’s direct effects and secondary problems like the way the auto manufacturers slashed orders in 2020, forcing the chip manufacturers to sign other contracts to avoid idling that much capacity[1], and unrelated problems happening at the same time like cryptocurrency pulling capacity away from useful applications.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eetimes.com&#x2F;the-chips-are-down-with-no-relief-in-sight&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eetimes.com&#x2F;the-chips-are-down-with-no-relief-in...</a><p>1.

            There is a lot of scalping going on. I keep an eye on certain parts and as soon the stock comes up, it disappears within minutes. Then you can buy all those chips on AliBaba at 10 times the price.
I think government should look into that as this is a huge problem for many businesses.

(ref below)<p>Is there an officially designated cost&#x2F;reduced risk ratio that policy makers can go by to determine if a regulation is worth while?<p>Is a regulation that costs 1 billion dollars to save 10 lives at 100 million a life considered worthwhile?<p>Is a regulation that costs 1 billion dollars to save 1 million lives at a cost of 1000 a life worthwhile?<p>Is there even an officially designated cost per life saved for new safety regulations?<p>If not it seems like a slippery slope, and the government can never overreach as long as it can justify the regulation by saying it saves a single life.<p>Reference:

            A far better way to reduce energy consumption is to not move mass in the first place.<p>Not building new cars certainly helps with that goal (since older working ICE cars do not junked anyway, they just go to someone else).

            I believe that driving an old car for longer has a smaller environmental impact than consistently driving newer cars as the bulk of emissions is during the manufacturing process.

            The same factors would seem to apply to EVs (except perhaps poor maintenance, but I am not knowledgeable enough about EVs to be sure), so for the purposes of comparison, I figured apples to apples would be comparing expected lifetimes of both assuming they are not abused or neglected.

            It seems to me that they are using an expected lifetime (in the &quot;expected value&quot; sense) of 200,000 km for both types of vehicles.<p>If those factors apply equally and dominate the reasons vehicles reach EOL, then the expected lifetime not varying significantly between the vehicle types looks like a reasonable assumption.<p>Using the real expected lifetime taking into account the circumstances that tend to render a vehicle permanently unserviceable in the real world looks like the correct approach to determine how manufacturing costs are amortised over the vehicle lifetime.

            only if they have been built to do so.<p>the same busted (and hard to repair) body parts will occur in both.  Think AC, window motors, lamps and switches, etc.<p>plus, none of the manufacturers seem to be investing in easily replaceable batteries.  They&#x27;d rather you buy a new car.

            The opposite is true - the manufacturing process is responsible for an average of 7-10 tonnes of CO2, while the same vehicle over its lifetime will emit more than 50 tonnes from the exhaust.<p>Moreover manufacturers have been reducing their carbon footprint lately. As an example VW reports that 70% of the energy the use in plants is provided by renewable sources.<p>That being said while emissions rules have been getting more stringent over the years, they&#x27;re increasingly being followed through introducing EVs, not improvements in engine efficiency.

The energy used by the VW plants keeps the lights on, air conditioned, and powers tools for assembly.

            This seems to be the crucial bit that is always missing from these discussions. I don&#x27;t doubt that the CO2 emitted in the assembly of the car is less than in the driving. But I&#x27;m curious about all the other environmental impacts (of which CO2 is just one small bit). The destruction of wildlife habitat, the poisoning of ground water, etc, that&#x27;s involved in the retrieval and processing of the raw materials, on up through the chain.

            The question of whether to keep an old car or buy a new, cleaner car is difficult, with many important unspecified variables such as who &#x27;owns&#x27; the emissions due to the manufacture of a car (the manufacturer? the first owner? all owners?).<p>This isn&#x27;t true for mileage though.
