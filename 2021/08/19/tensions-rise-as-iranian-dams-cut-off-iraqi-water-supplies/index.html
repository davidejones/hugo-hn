            Because of course there&#x27;s a database of water conflicts going back over 6,000 years. I mean, why wouldn&#x27;t that be a thing? There&#x27;s probably a database of pokemon conflicts, so it shouldn&#x27;t feel so surprising...<p>Anyway, thanks!<p>&gt; Two members of the right-wing &quot;Order of the Rising Sun&quot; are arrested in Chicago with 30-40 kg of typhoid cultures with which they allegedly planned to poison the water supply in Chicago, St. Louis, and other cities. Experts say the plan is unlikely to cause health problems due to water chlorination.<p>I actually burst out laughing. &quot;My dastardly plan! <i>twirls moustache</i> Foiled by... chlorine! How could anyone have known?&quot; Quite the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GPUgjy-Pn-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GPUgjy-Pn-4</a> vibe.<p>This is my new favorite database.

            I have to refer back to these long traditional rivals when I read people waxing poetic about the prospect of erasing international borders and becoming a brotherhood of man and then at the same time rejecting homogenization of culture.  You can’t eat your cake and have it.<p>These are two historic rivals.  Maybe with the right governments they can work out deals like we work out with Canada and Mexico with regard to shared resources —but I’m not holding my breath on this given the Kurds are kind of the out group within the Iraqi family and probably won’t get full support from the central govt.

            It strikes me as an example of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;Narcissism of Small Differences&quot;[1]: &quot;The thesis that communities with adjoining territories and close relationships are especially likely to engage in feuds and mutual ridicule because of hypersensitivity to details of differentiation.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Narcissism_of_small_differences" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Narcissism_of_small_difference...</a>

            And by sheer coincidence, I very recently learnt on a HN linked article on big-endian and little-endianness that these terms come from Gulliver&#x27;s Travels by Jonathan Swift [0], where Lilliput and Blefuscu wage war over which end should be cracked first when eating a hard-boiled egg:<p>&gt; <i>The novel further describes an intra-Lilliputian quarrel over the practice of breaking eggs. Traditionally, Lilliputians broke boiled eggs on the larger end; a few generations ago, an Emperor of Lilliput, the Present Emperor&#x27;s great-grandfather, had decreed that all eggs be broken on the smaller end after his son cut himself breaking the egg on the larger end. The differences between Big-Endians (those who broke their eggs at the larger end) and Little-Endians had given rise to &quot;six rebellions ... wherein one Emperor lost his life, and another his crown&quot;. The Lilliputian religion says an egg should be broken on the convenient end, which is now interpreted by the Lilliputians as the smaller end. The Big-Endians gained favour in Blefuscu.</i><p>This seems like a perfect fictional example of the Narcissism of Small Differences, published more than a century before the birth of Sigmund Freud!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lilliput_and_Blefuscu#Satirical_interpretations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lilliput_and_Blefuscu#Satirica...</a>

            I recall an American military officer describing his trying to understand the local human conflicts and alliances while serving in Iraq.   Region to region and even village to village (often right next to each other) he struggled to understand &#x2F; balance it all.<p>People have their reasons, but ultimately they have to feel safe &#x2F; want to work together too.<p>That&#x27;s not a justification of any given military action but more about the complexities in some regions.   We think in terms of nations, some places there are so many other layers... sometimes it&#x27;s not even just nation vs nation politics playing out.

            The ability to delegate decisions up and down through layers of the government and mostly ... not involve all the infighting that COULD come from it is pretty amazing IMO.<p>Once in a while some folks in my area get all worked up about how some regional transportation authority made some decision but man ... we do not need each city and layer of gov making their own call &#x2F; fighting about it.  And that&#x27;s without any kinda &#x27;serious&#x27; tribal factors at play.

            It still exists in the form of different “street gangs” and “the mob” families.  They just don’t happen to run regions outlined by political boundaries.  These are people who otherwise are very much alike but will inflict violence upon the other as necessary.

            This is just completely wrong. Western society also had periods of clans and tribes in its history. It&#x27;s more that it moved on from it. The British Empire used inter-tribal rivalries as a tool to further its influence and spread. Scots still wear kilts whose colours are clan-specific.<p>Maybe, by &#x27;Western&#x27; society you mean &#x27;America&#x27;?

            I interpret them as saying “we think that because tribalism is a minor issue in the west and normally doesn’t surface, then we must generalize that it’s also a non-issue elsewhere” it is however, far from being the case.

            They’re treated poorly in all three major countries there, Iran, Iraq and Turkey.  The brits should have carved out a country for them, for they are different enough to deserve their own self determination.  If we didn’t have Turkey in NATO and hadn’t messed with Iraq we could have helped the formation of Kurdistan, but there’s no guarantee these three wouldn’t have steamrolled them to prevent potential fragmentation from other internal out groups.<p>Unfortunately in the 1800s as other geographies fought wars to rid differences to achieve unification, things were too tribal to achieve that there.   I guess the idea of Mesopotamia was too distant to serve as a glue for all the different interests.

            At the time these countries were created none of them were powerful enough to be a regional competitor to Britain. The brits were keen for individual countries to be stable so that they were easier to govern. Remember also that the British empire wasn’t created following a top-down strategic plan and that operationally it was a mass of country-specific special cases

            At the time of World War I, the British <i>already</i> had pretty much the rest of non-Ottoman Arabia under various forms of protectorates, and Persia too for that matter--Persia being by far the most powerful country in the region, at least outside of the soon-to-be-carved-up Ottomans.<p>During World War I, the British freaked out about the potential unrest that the Ottoman sultan (as caliph) could provoke in their Muslim lands, and as a result made multiple incompatible agreements with whatever forces would be willing to help fight against the Ottomans in the Middle East. In particular, everyone was promised Palestine if they would help in the fight. When it came time to do the actual carving, the British, in fine imperial tradition, honored none of these agreements.<p>In the actual agreement, the British and the French carved up the Arab regions somewhat (but not entirely) in the vein of the Sykes-Picot agreement, with the French choosing for themselves a majority Christian domain in Lebanon and a majority Muslim domain in Syria. The British kept Palestine for itself, granted Hejaz independence along its original Ottoman provincial boundaries, and created independent states of Transjordan and Iraq, each to be ruled by the sons of the new Hejai king (the upgraded Sharif of Mecca).

            Great point. A core cause of the endless wars in the middle east is people pushed into the truly evil British model of a minority in power over a weaker but larger other party. I get that there are lots of existing problems but doing this in countries on purpose is unforgivable.<p>My own country (the us) fucks things up too of course - Afghanistan being the latest example, but we have our own long list of shame (Iraq, many countries in south and central America...).

            I&#x27;d have expected them to be somewhat natural allies. They are the two largest majority Shiite countries in the world by a large margin. Worldwide only around 10% of Muslims are Shiite. Around 90% are Sunni.<p>My understanding is that Shiite vs Sunni is a big deal in Islam, akin to the Protestant vs Catholic split in Christianity. But not the Protestant vs Catholic split as it is now, but more like it was shortly after it happened when it was taken a lot more seriously.

            There is no such thing as a natural ally based on faith.  We have examples of the same thing in Europe as powers attempted to control resources (arable land in agrarian times).  They may ally against a common enemy or due to pacts  which were broken from time to time.  Germany and Japan allied and really had little in common beside a desire to control geography for the sake of resource extraction.

            Cost makes it still essentially zero sum, unless we get actual cheap fusion off the ground anyway. Very few countries can afford to use water from desalination at any scale, and even for them the cost of it is an order of magnitude or more than using existing runoff - when the runoff exists.

It&#x27;s called an insurmountable power differential. Canada and mexico simple have to do what they are told. We&#x27;ve fought wars against canada( british empire ) and mexico and taken significant amount of territory from both to ensure that these countries &quot;share their resources&quot; as told.

Similar to what we are trying to do with the uyghurs in china, rohingya in myanmar, the balochs in pakistan, india, africa, etc. One of the benefits of having drawn out nations in africa is that the nations are full of different ethnic groups that can be pit against each other making these african nations easier to control. Not sure it was the original intent, but that&#x27;s where we are right now.

An Iranian state has existed in more or less continuous form as an independent polity since the breakup of the Timurid Empire in ~1500. The three-way contest between the Ottomans, Safavid Persia, and Russia is a staple of the region&#x27;s politics for virtually the entirety of the Early Modern period.

            &gt; This is completely false when you&#x27;re talking about Iran.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say completely false.<p>&gt;  An Iranian state has existed in more or less continuous form as an independent polity since the breakup of the Timurid Empire in ~1500.<p>More or less? Independent polity? You are independent or you are not independent. You can&#x27;t be &quot;more or less&quot; independent than you can be &quot;more or less&quot; pregnant.<p>It certainly wasn&#x27;t independent after it was invaded and conquered by the british and soviets? It certainly wasn&#x27;t independent after the british and soviets installed their own puppet to rule over iran.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran</a><p>Iran, china, india, etc all love to claim thousand years whatever. Perhaps culturally, historically, etc they have a point but neither iran, china, india, etc are old states.

            &gt; As far as the Iranian authorities are concerned, &quot;Iraq&#x27;s interests are irrelevant,&quot; she adds bluntly.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that Iraq has missiles capable of destroying dams. Seems like that would be a relevant bargaining point.
