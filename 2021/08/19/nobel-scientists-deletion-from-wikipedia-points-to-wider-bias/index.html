            What happened here was atypical for Wikipedia &quot;deletionism&quot; debates.<p>Normally, when you read a story like this, someone created an article and someone else petitioned to have it deleted (with an &quot;AfD&quot;) and there&#x27;s a whole debate log you can read, and you could try to assess people&#x27;s biases from the comments they left in the AfD.<p>Here, though, no article was ever created (prior to 2018, when Strickland was awarded her Nobel). Instead, a beginner editor wrote a <i>draft</i> of an article through the &quot;Articles for Creation&quot; (&quot;AfC&quot;) process. AfC drafts are, apparently, reviewed by admins before being promoted to the &quot;mainspace&quot; of real articles. You can read the draft here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?oldid=842614385" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?oldid=842614385</a><p>This is a stub article --- merely the beginning of a real article. And that&#x27;s fine; it&#x27;s how lots of good articles start out. But it&#x27;s easy to see how an admin churning through AfC stub drafts might not have clearly understood the notability of the subject. The article links mostly to the professor&#x27;s own research group. There are hundreds of thousands of academics whose position in the encyclopedia could also be established with links to their research groups!<p>What I think is probably more important here though is that the original article, the one we talk about as being &quot;deleted&quot;, was created with a special process where the author asked for permission to have it added. That&#x27;s not how Wikipedia ordinarily works; you have to opt in to the permissions process. The author could just as easily have simply created a Strickland article in the mainspace, and the process that deleted it would have been more formal, would have included appeals, and there&#x27;d be a log of the reasoning. It likely would have survived. The author of the draft essentially asked for that <i>not</i> to happen, by using the AfC process.<p>It seems important to add here: had it been an actual article, and had it been deleted through a speedy deletion or a full-blown AfD process, it would be more difficult to get a Strickland article onto WP in the future (not &quot;difficult&quot;, just &quot;more difficult&quot;). But there wasn&#x27;t, so, in the entire span of time prior to Strickland&#x27;s Nobel, anybody could have created a stub article for her and her work. From what I can tell, nobody did. That, to me, is the more telling phenomenon here, not the draft deletion.

            &gt; <i>There are hundreds of thousands of academics whose position in the encyclopedia could also be established with links to their research groups!</i><p>Yup, that&#x27;s really the crux of it. Wikipedia isn&#x27;t meant for every tenured professor to have a page, the same way an actor with only one IMDB credit doesn&#x27;t get a page either. And sadly that stub article doesn&#x27;t seem to clearly explain why this particular professor does.<p>In hindsight &quot;Nobel prize laureate&quot; is obviously notable... but it&#x27;s the job of someone creating a page to make the notability rationale clear.

            Not sure I actually agree.<p>If articles such as this get stricken off and she hadn&#x27;t won a novel prize someone would just cite &quot;deleted as before&quot; when someone attempts to start a new article again.

            What I don&#x27;t like about this article (besides the very obvious conclusions that it starts out with and then hits you over the head with) is that it doesn&#x27;t attempt to reach any wikipedia mod or reviewer for a comment. It&#x27;s only the author&#x27;s side and the author&#x27;s narrative. Also, correlation does not imply causation. The fact that women&#x27;s pages get deleted more often doesn&#x27;t mean that there is a gender bias against women.

            Are we looking at different things? I just wrote a whole long comment on this after poking around on WP about it, and I&#x27;d be glad to know if I got things completely scrambled. Because what I see is a page created in 2018, and a _lot_ of intra-WP coverage of the process that led to there not being a page before 2018, all of which squares with what this article says.

            People are assuming quite a bit.<p>If an article about a professor is written and has virtually no references, then it&#x27;s not the admin&#x27;s job to do research to see if she is notable or not. It should be tagged as &quot;needs references&quot; and if they are not provided, eventually deleted.<p>In her particular case, the article didn&#x27;t even exist - only a draft did - which was not approved because it had no references. The rejection notice specifically suggests resubmitting with references.<p>The story&#x2F;study about bias is interesting, but they picked a poor example to showcase.

            Right, the Nobel Prize didn&#x27;t make her notable, it recognized her existing notability.  What made her notable was the work she did <i>before</i> she got the prize.   Wikipedian editors incorrectly failed to recognize her notability, because their byzantine bureaucracy is riddled with blind-spots.

            Repeating myself from upthread here, but it doesn&#x27;t look like this person was deleted from Wikipedia at all. A newcomer asked if there should be a Strickland article, and a volunteer on the project said &quot;based on the article you came up with, it doesn&#x27;t look like there should be&quot;. The newcomer didn&#x27;t have to ask; they could have (and probably should have) just posted the article directly, which is the ordinary process.

            Prominent to optics experts before the award, clearly, not to Wikipedia editors. It&#x27;s easy to tell who&#x27;s prominent in distant past (it&#x27;s the people in history textbooks), but if your guide to recent prominence is things like lists of awards or frequent mentions in the media, you may be getting some corner cases from time to time.

            Wikipedia editors need to fix that. The notability criteria are skewed, tending to think that every minor person in the pop culture is notable, but regularly dumping scientists and local elected officials (the latter is a problem when they run for higher office and people can&#x27;t find information about them).<p>They could relax the standard for deletion and it wouldn&#x27;t hurt anything. If some editors think someone is prominent and others don&#x27;t, leave the article in place, even if the &quot;not prominent&quot; side has a majority.  If the article doesn&#x27;t meet standards, tag it as a stub or with the &quot;multiple issues&quot; tag.

            Well, when you&#x27;re wrong, and especially when you&#x27;re exceptionally wrong as in this &quot;corner case&quot;, it makes a lot of sense to try to understand what kind of process failure and institutional biases may have played a part in the bad decision.

            One of the problems with binary classifiers is that you can&#x27;t simultaneously make low errors in both directions. That&#x27;s not &quot;an institutional failure&quot;, that&#x27;s practically a law of nature. You have to live with the fact that sometimes you&#x27;re wrong. What errors to make is the core of the feud between deletionists and inclusionists.

            Typical<p>Wrote up a long description about how the equipment I used for my master&#x27;s worked (fleshing out a stub article). Only to have some moderator (being extremely polite here) revert the whole thing because it was &quot;uncited&quot;.
When challenged I ended up getting temp banned for telling them &quot;I know how it works I just built one&quot;. Haven&#x27;t trusted or contributed since it&#x27;s moving closer to a collective &quot;what we want to know&quot; information service which makes me want to invest more in an actual encyclopedia.

            You&#x27;re being downvoted because everyone knows Wikipedia is built on citations. There&#x27;s no way for any reader or editor to know whether you know how it works or not.<p>So Wikipedia is built primarily around not even primary sources but secondary sources for a good reason.<p>Yes it may lose out in some valuable knowledge such as yours in the process -- but it achieves a greater good of minimizing Wikipedia being flooded by incorrect or even harmful information.<p>In the absence of an omniscient impartial arbitrer, requiring citations of secondary sources is a pretty good rule.

            &gt; it&#x27;s moving closer to a collective &quot;what we want to know&quot; service<p>I&#x27;d say it is moving towards a &quot;what we want you to think&quot; corpus, with politically motivated activists taking over from objective editors. Those activists will use the language of editors, calling upon the myriad of policies put in place when Wikipedia was growing, while bending and changing that language towards their own goals.

            I know it&#x27;s frustrating to write true things and have them deleted, but I hope you understand how bad it would be to generalize the rule &quot;accept uncited&#x2F;unverified claims as true if the account who wrote them says it&#x27;s true.&quot;<p>I say this as someone who spent weeks writing up a new Wikipedia article with 50 citations and then had it graded a C because I used too many primary sources instead of secondary sources. I empathize with you, but I also empathize with the editors.

            Yes and no.<p>I&#x27;d argue having an unpolished article in need of work is better than a stub as it encourages interaction.<p>Not to mention being told to stop using a paywall for citing a journal (which is now out of print) as a source.

            At this point I&#x27;m willing to go to go toe on this on a typical debate perspective.<p>If I&#x27;m being voted down what is so great about the ignorance of the masses here?<p>Wikipedia has some serious (and in come cases concerningly anti-science) biases. Which is honestly love for them to address at a community level.
