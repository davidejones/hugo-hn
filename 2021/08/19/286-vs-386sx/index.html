            &gt; That’s why the 386SX had a pretty short shelf life. Once AMD had 386 chips to sell, Intel cut prices on 486s. But for a couple of years it served a purpose. And the chip lived on as a budget option for a couple of more years.<p>TBH that kind of a short shelf life wasn&#x27;t just a 386 thing. Clocks speeds and architectures were advancing quickly, and all chips had a really short shelf life.<p>For example, in the span of 5 years (say &#x27;91-96) you could upgrade from a 386SX 16MHz to a 486DX 50MHz to a Pentium 90MHz, each time paying about the same amount of money but getting a 3x speed-up. And other components like video cards were improving just as quickly.<p>People were upgrading every couple of years because the difference between older and newer models was night and day. Imagine if in 2015 you bought an Intel i3 3GHz and this year you could buy an i7 15GHz with 8x the RAM for the same price.

            Around that time I was building &quot;high end&quot; PCs for friends and friends-of-friends.  I remember the average price stayed around $2500, but the component availability iterated pretty quickly in terms of processor, HDD size&#x2F;interface, graphics, standard RAM, etc.<p>A 2 year old PC felt woefully underpowered in that era, and a 4 year old PC was almost useless if you wanted to use any &quot;current&quot; software. You&#x27;d be out of drive space, unable to run a lot of programs&#x2F;games, and limping along.<p>Now, my 8 year old Macbook Air is still more or less as functional and useful as it was when I got it.

            &gt; Now, my 8 year old Macbook Air is still more or less as functional and useful as it was when I got it.<p>This is my frustration with Apple&#x27;s policy of dropping support for hardware in MacOS.  It made sense in the 90&#x27;s to upgrade every 2-3 years because you got 1.5-3x more performance each time.  So 6 year old hardware was almost an order of magnitude less capable.<p>Fast-forwarding to today, a &quot;legacy&quot; 10 year old (&quot;Mid-2011&quot;) MacBook Pro supports just as much memory (16GB) as Apple&#x27;s current M1 offerings.  The M1 does put up some very impressive numbers on the single-thread CPU front, but that&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve gotten used to such small progress every year--it&#x27;s only about 2x the speed of the 2011 MBP for single thread tasks.

            &gt; my 8 year old Macbook Air is still more or less as functional and useful as it was when I got it.<p>Right? I remember the enormous performance jumps from 286 to 386 to 486DX2 to Pentium to P6S...<p>Today, I&#x27;m still using a late 2013 MBP. Other than the lame 128GB of disk space, it is still my primary machine and is fine for everything I do. Most of my work is done in the cloud anyway so its essentially a 1970&#x27;s dumb terminal.

            I&#x27;ve been using my 2012 desktop without any discenible issues. The only thing I can&#x27;t do is edit 4K video and for that I use my 2019 Macbook. I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of upgrading my desktop but I have no compelling reason, and the idea of reinstalling all my applications (I&#x27;m still on Windows 7) makes it really unlikely. To be fair though, I don&#x27;t play games on it.

            To some degree I imagine there’s also a question of how much demand we put on these modern old computers that reflects changing&#x2F;diminishing interests as we age. There are certainly workloads available today that would cripple an 8 yo computer (Mac or PC), workloads that a younger version of you may have been more interested in (multiple VMs, gaming, real-time video processing at same time). You probably stressed your 386 to the breaking point within three years of buying it, and you could easily load up an 8yo computer today to its breaking point. My 2016-era laptop is no longer useful to me as, well, anything except an emergency backup.<p>If one can’t discern issues with a four-five yo computer, I would very humbly suggest it also says something about the demands of the owner stultifying to a degree.

            I had exactly that 386SX as my first CPU ever, and I recall the incredible speed boost you&#x27;d get each time you upgraded. It was like magic, each time you or a friend got a new machine, everything would be so much faster.<p>Something similar happened with graphics cards, each new generation made stuff look that much better.<p>These days I can still use a 2013 Macbook to play MineCraft, doesn&#x27;t feel any different.

            You can still use a 286 to play King’s Quest, too. A 2013  Mac is in no way an adequate gaming machine in any sense of the idea. You couldn’t still use a 286 to play Falcon 3 or Comanche back when they were new, and you can’t use a 2013-gen tech stack to realize  full potential of today’s games. The benchmark of playable Minecraft is not a suitable measure for capability, only a reflection of unchanging demands since 2013.

            There was a point in time where the absolute best dollars&#x2F;performance ratio was the AMD 386DX&#x2F;40, which ran circles around the Intel 386DX&#x2F;25 and 386DX&#x2F;33, but was priced the same or less.<p>And was considerably less expensive than a very top end ($2500-3500 in 1992-1994 dollars) desktop built with something like a Pentium 60 or 66 MHz.<p>Inflation calculator tells me that a $2500 desktop PC in 1993 would be the same as about $4700 today. For 4700 you could build a real beast of a machine.

In the mid and late 80s there was such a thing as a 286 12 MHz which sold for the same price as a much slower Intel part.<p>I&#x27;m referring to the whole time frame before the Cyrix 5x86 and similar were even a thing...  There were plenty of AMD 286 and 386 CPUs sold in the early 1990s.

            I recently upgraded a computer built in ~2013 to one with 2019-2020 components. Maybe it&#x27;s because I went from lower-middle tier components to upper-middle tier, but I noticed a <i>very</i> significant performance boost: my NVMe drive boots in seconds (versus ~1 minute with my SATA SSD), and I can build large Rust projects nearly instantly without breaking a sweat (my old AMD FX CPU would turn into a radiator).

            I worked in the DELL Manufacturing plant in north Austin (Metric Blvd) on the 386-&gt;486 heydays. The DELL Optiplex 386SX will run around 800 to 1200 DLLS and came pre-installed with MD DOS 6.1 and Windows 3.1. When the 486 machines started churning out of the factory Windows 95 came to be and the PCs came pre loaded preloaded with a short action snippet of TOP-GUN and MS Encarta Encyclopedia so you could test your optional and expensive  Sound Blaster 16 card.

            I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a normal abbreviation. If you Google &quot;DLLS&quot; all the results are about DLLs (and that&#x27;s obviously not because dollars are an obscure technical term). Maybe you were thinking of USD?

            Wing Commander 2 is responsible for putting the most SoundBlasters into pre-Win95 computers. And it wasn&#x27;t just for the sound capabilities. The first generation of SB cards included a CD-ROM interface. Prior to ATAPI there was no standard way to put an optical drive in a PC. SoundBlaster put the sound and CD-ROM interface on one card it saved you having to buy extra hardware, and encouraged developers to use discs for distributing their software.<p>Eventually IDE&#x2F;ATAPI drives became the norm, and I believe the SB16 dropped the proprietary CD-ROM.

            The first computer I built myself was a 386 SX&#x2F;33 with 4 megs of RAM and VGA (I think). I couldn&#x27;t afford a hard drive at first because I was a kid, so all i had was a 3.5 inch floppy drive. Had to buy a hard drive later, and if I had to guess, it was an 80 megabyte one. In the mean time, I could use a RAM drive.<p>Computer Shopper was such an amazing magazine to go through, and I would always try and find the best deal from the systems advertised, not that I had any real money. Usually it was from the ads in the back, not the big pretty Gateway ads in the front.

            In general, you can still save a lot of money, and have a higher quality end result by building your own desktop system, unless you want a really low-end machine.  Well, this is not quite true these days, but if the blockchain madness abates, then GPU prices will fall back into reasonable levels.

            I have not found that to be true at all.  It&#x27;s true if you go with a high-end custom pc builder, but you can often get a very respectable desktop prebuilt for less than the cost of equivalent components.

            The 1990 through 2000 stand out to me as the biggest period of innovation and technical acceleration where it comes to PC. While the 80&#x27;s certainly witnessed the birth and growth of the &quot;personal computer&quot;, most of the computers in that decade were still 8086- and 8088-class machines, along with the barely-more-capable 80286 that didn&#x27;t get popular until the late 80&#x27;s.<p>But in the 90&#x27;s we went from 286 and 386 class machines to the scorching-fast 750MHz AMD Athlon. It was very depressing to sink a few thousand dollars into a new mid-range system, only to see it worth about half that a year later. And a doorstop 3 years later.<p>Now we&#x27;re back to the point where almost any computer you buy will do a good job for common tasks (i.e. not gaming and crypto mining) for at least 5 years or more. My current machine is a 7-year-old laptop and runs all modern software just fine. Unthinkable just a couple decades ago!

            I had a 286 12MHz and then upgraded to a 386sx 40Mhz (both manufactured by AMD, btw).<p>It was a HUGE upgrade.<p>First, 12Mhz to 40Mhz was an amazing upgrade, but that was definitely not the reason why I upgraded.<p>The real reason was *compatibilityé.<p>The 286 was compatible with close to nothing by the early 90&#x27;s.
Doom? Sure, runs slow on the 386sx, but on the 286? Does not run at all.
And the same goes for all games and programs using one of:
1) 32 bit DOS extenders
2) EMS
3) any amount of XMS more than my 286 could handle
4) &gt;600KB conventional memory, because there&#x27;s only that much HIMEM.SYS can do

            The first PC that I actually owned was a 386SX running at 20 MHz, 2 MB and a 20 MB hard disk that I would later use DR-DOS and MS-DOS disk compression drivers so that I could fit Windows 3.1 and Borland compilers for MS-DOS and Windows, ARJ&#x2F;ZIP and Office.<p>Not much was left for documents, so I would &quot;garbage collect&quot; old stuff into floppies.<p>Still was quite useful for about 5 years, however being an SX meant that eventually I could not keep up with my favourite flight sims as they started asking for 386DX as minimum.

            &gt; and the ability to use more memory, since most 286 boards topped out at 4MB or even 1MB, versus 16MB for a 386sx. Few people ever upgraded their 386SXs that far, but they liked having the option.<p>&quot;Few people ever upgraded their 386SXs that far&quot; is a bit of an understatement.  In 1990 2MB of ram cost about the same as a 386DX CPU.  By 1992 ram had dropped to about $50&#x2F;MB, but the Am386DX and the 486SX, both of which blew the i386SX out of the water were generally available at this point and cost less than 4MB of ram.<p>One thing TFA doesn&#x27;t mention is that the Am386SX (and SXL) had usage in battery powered applications for some time after this (not as common as today) due to their very thrifty power usage (with a fully static core, there was no lower limit on the clock-speed it could run at <i>and</i> it was lower power usage than Intel&#x27;s SL when running at full speed).

I begged by dad over and over to buy a 386DX, not a SX, but no luck on that.<p>There was something weird where windows wouldn&#x27;t run in 386 protected mode. I was sure it was DX and SX, but this article has the assertion that protected mode worked with SX. I know my dad replaced the system, I assumed he updated the CPU, but maybe it was a bad mobo or something.<p>DIY computing to me will always be RLL&#x2F;MFM hard disks with insane ribbon cables and IRQ toggles on ISA slots.<p>God, I am old.

            &gt; Cynically, I think there was one more reason. Intel had to license the 286 to other companies. They didn’t license the 386. I think they produced the 386SX to displace those second-source 286s.<p>The Harris 286 chips overclocked handily. The difference between 25Mhz and 40Mhz on a 286 was noticeable, too; except when anything hit the ISA bus which din&#x27;t push much at all.<p>There were a few systems in that era with SRAM instead of DRAM; I always regretted not catching one.

            286 was limited to 16bit registers, the 386 had 32bit registers and could also enable a 4GB flat memory model. It enabled a completely different architecture and programming model, just like how the first amd64 with new 64bit registers enabled a whole different architecture.

            What’s interesting about the 286&#x2F;386 transition is: “Protected Mode” came about with the 286, but was still a 16 bit mode. (Random fact: the only way to return to “Real Mode” on a 286 was through a processor reset). The 386 changed Protected Mode into the 32 bit mode we know today.

            Architecturally the 386 was a massive improvement over the 286. It had an MMU. You could run it in protected mode, run an operating system that would continue running after a program crashed.<p>The 286 technically also protected mode but it really sucked.

            The MMU was a sanity-saver even in DOS development using a DOS-extender like DOS4GW or CWSDPMI, where a crash could actually be debugged&#x2F;output a stacktrace rather than instantly reboot the machine.<p>A fair-few DOS applications (via DPMI) also implemented virtual memory schemes like a &quot;real OS&quot; - I remember POVRay 2.0 officially requiring 2 MB of RAM, but was able to start on my 1MB 386SX machine (albeit with 1-2 mins of HDD-thrashing...).

            As I remember it, it was the same die for all 486s but the SX had the FPU disabled.<p>I&#x27;m sure this was done for marketing in some cases but I think Intel also worked out how to reclaim chips were the FPU was damaged as well.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intel_80486SX" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intel_80486SX</a>

            Except in the case of the Cyrix 486s which had 80486-like instructions but in a 386 package. (Cyrix&#x27;s business up until then was selling 387-compatible coprocessors, so perhaps there was some motivation to keep the demand for 386 motherboards up.)

            And the 487 FPU chip for them was actually a 486DX that just disabled the 486SX.

            I think of my first computer (Commodore 64) very fondly. The Commodore 128 less so and my first 8088 and 286 I mostly think of IRQ and config.sys hell.<p>I worked at a computer consulting company 1990-1991 and started my own company after that. Got very good at puzzling out how to jam as many ISA cards as my customers thought they needed into their computers. But I really think of that as the bad old days.<p>I remember getting computers on a network running SHGEN-1 and SHGEN-1 with Novell Netware 2.15 on 360k floppies on a 286. It took an hour for a single computer! I wouldn’t want to go back to that for anything.

            I remember having this CPU and playing Mortal Kombat and envy my neighbor who had 486DX.  If you are a programmer during the transition to 386 it got more interesting because of a lot of new CPU features.
