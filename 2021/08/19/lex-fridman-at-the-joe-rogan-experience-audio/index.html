            This description of Lex Fridman&#x27;s research is generous. If you listen to his own podcast (previously called the Artificial Intelligence podcast, now the Lex Fridman Podcast), you&#x27;ll find that he has a knack for missing the deeper insights of guests discussing those very fields of research.

            It&#x27;s unfortunate that as he&#x27;s become more popular his interviews have become increasingly self-indulgent and vapid.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s to appeal to a wider audience, however I think more likely it&#x27;s just a negative consequence of fame. With a lack of honest feedback you start to buy into your own bullshit, thinking that every personal idea you have is some profound philosophical insight, rather than the type of affected navel-gazing done by people who fancy themselves public intellectuals.

            Thanks. I&#x27;m sure this is worth listening to, but it&#x27;s a much larger investment in time than reading over a transcript.<p>Having tried the automated transcription services on my own podcast, I know that they suck. You have to pay someone to at least fix them up, if not just transcribe the whole thing from scratch. So I&#x27;m not blaming anyone for not having a transcript immediately.

            Hey @AlbertCory,<p>How would having a transcript save you time? Wouldn&#x27;t it take more or less the same amount of time (+&#x2F;- 25%) to read through the transcript? Would you rather CTRL+F for a few terms? Or just quickly glance through it?<p>Asking, because I&#x27;m interested in the podcast space overall.<p>Thanks.

            As the sibling says: I can skim over the boring, boilerplate stuff (&quot;thanks for having me&quot;) much faster in a transcript.<p>Since I can see the whole thing, it&#x27;s much easier to skip down to the more interesting stuff, or realize that there isn&#x27;t any.

            You would be surprised, but reading a transcript is much faster than listening, even on speedup (1.25x, 1.5x, )<p>You can also quickly scan ahead, or reread a sentence. Navigating audio is harder.

            This is a pretty light on math&#x2F;AI podcast in the series of podcasts between Rogan and Fridman. Some small talk about Boston Dynamics and Elon Musk, but more discussion surrounding Renzo Gracie and Wim Hof (sp?), if I&#x27;m recalling correctly.<p>It was not my favorite discussion between the two, but they did touch on the Russian education system, which was kind of interesting. I enjoy Rogan when he has scientists and comedians on as he usually lets them talk on the subjects they are interested in, but Lex Fridman seemed to want to discuss the Topics that Rogan was interested in, which was a little disappointing.

            Half the US didn&#x27;t vote for Republicans its more like 47% overwhelmingly tilted towards white men especially those with no educational achievement.<p>Looking back over the last 41 years at least of my life as a white man I would have been substantially better off if white men couldn&#x27;t vote. It&#x27;s embarrassing and yes these people including neighbors, some family even are bad people willing to bed down with nazis.

            Good catch correcting me that 47% is not half.<p>Are you saying that the votes of uneducated people should be worth less than those of college educated people?

            I&#x27;m saying that objectively people who are privileged by existing broken systems and people who are uneducated both make bad choices.<p>If we made college free I would absolutely be OK with making completing a degree a prerequisite to being allowed to vote along with an IQ test every 10 years excluding people under 90 and a pop quiz on current events where people who couldn&#x27;t answer such questions as who their senators are would see their vote go straight in the trash.<p>Excluding people who are lazy, stupid, or ignorant would result in a better decision making process. None of this is politically possible.

            How can people who don&#x27;t even know who they are voting for until they go in a booth and see whose name has an R or a D by it possibly pick good leaders?<p>If in a century people are living in the carcass of civilization will we celebrate that we achieved our ruin progressively or inclusively?<p>Let&#x27;s be real though people aren&#x27;t worried about being progressive they are more apt to worried because they support a political party that could never survive without the ignorant and the stupid.<p>If only people  with college degrees who actually made a minimal effort to follow non Facebook meme politics could vote the republicans would only be competitive vs the green party.

            My only critique is that by labelling everyone a Nazi we are washing out the Nazi label, thus enabling future establishment of the actual Nazis, because everyone will think that those future Nazis are no worse than Joe Rogans of today.

            Yeah, we should probably throw everyone in the oven who doesn&#x27;t adhere to our worldview. &#x2F;s<p>I sometimes wonder who the news is talking about re: fascism, but then I see it here: talking about not giving someone oxygen on HN who YOU don&#x27;t agree with.

            My statement was as measured and calm as this one is as contrasted with you creating a throwaway exclusively to freak out and post this rabid screed with an over the top analogy, followed by a sentence with 4 exclamation points, followed by an exhortation for me to calm down.<p>Don&#x27;t create throwaways in order to post verbal seizures.

            Agreed, Joe Rogan is, at best, a somewhat misleading entertainer, and at worst an evil propagandist. It should be a crime to give him airtime.
