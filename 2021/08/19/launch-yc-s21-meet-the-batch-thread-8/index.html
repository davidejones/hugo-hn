            Hi, I&#x27;m Vrinda Gupta. I worked at Visa Inc. for years, launching popular credit cards. But when I applied for the Chase Sapphire Reserve (the credit card I helped develop), I was rejected! I&#x27;m now the CEO and Co-Founder of Sequin, a debit card that builds credit for women risk-free with no credit history required. My co-founder, Mark Thomas, spent over a decade at PayPal leading ACH products in various EM roles.<p>I was rejected from the credit card I helped launch because, despite having a high income, I lacked credit history. I had been using my debit card and was an authorized user on my dad&#x27;s card - neither of which was building my personal credit history.<p>I saw in Visa data that 70% of women&#x27;s spend (concentrated around young women), was similarly on debit or cards in other people&#x27;s names. As a result, women were disproportionately being rejected by credit cards or getting lower limits and higher interested rates - even though we are shown to be better to lend to. Young women have the largest spending power of any demographic in history, yet there is a clear gender gap in financial services. We&#x27;re leveling the playing field.<p>Our first product, the Sequin Card is the first debit card that builds credit for women. Unlike traditional debit cards (which do not build credit), Sequin fronts the money for purchases in the background and repays ourselves automatically from a linked bank account daily. We then report repayment history to credit bureaus - and voila, you&#x27;re building credit.<p>Sequin users are primarily young women who are new to the workforce, and are looking to establish or build credit more effectively (towards a higher value credit card). Soon, we&#x27;ll launch our own suite of credit cards geared towards women with smarter underwriting, targeted rewards, and safer repayment options.<p>Anyone can apply for Sequin - we designed the product to center women&#x27;s financial needs (for the first time in history - women could be denied a credit card without a male co-signer until 1974)!<p>Looking forward to your comments!

            Because this product doesn’t seem to be doing anything different and the only way they can get buyers it is to try to proclaim that the service is made specifically for “insert underserved group here”.<p>It’s a common trend with startups being accepted into YC nowadays.

            &gt; I was rejected from the credit card I helped launch because, despite having a high income, I lacked credit history.<p>This happened to me. I got a job in Petaluma, CA where I was rejected <i>for internet service</i> because my credit history was &quot;Unknown risk&quot;, i.e. I had no credit history.

            Another use case where this is potentially useful: relocation.  I&#x27;ve been rejected for financial things before after international moves, since I have no credit history _in that place_.  Income?  Doesn&#x27;t matter.  Previous history elsewhere?  Doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>This is _also_ an issue for self-employed people, contract workers, or...well, basically anyone who doesn&#x27;t fit the &quot;I stayed in one place and work full-time&quot; mould.

            Really cool!  What&#x27;s the biggest differentiator between Sequin and a secured credit card?  Me and my wife used the latter as the first step to help build our credit history...but admittedly the limit was small.

            Secured cards have high deposits ($200+) and can still get you into debt if you don&#x27;t pay back &#x2F; pay min &#x2F; pay late - affects women more than men.

            Congratulations! This sounds very exciting. I&#x27;ve heard about the inequality in financial products but didn&#x27;t really understand why, thanks for the explanation of this particular bit.<p>I could imagine that this is a problem that women may not realise until it&#x27;s &quot;too late&quot; – when they get to opening that credit card or applying for a mortgage. While Sequin would help address that situation if used in advance, is there anything that can be done at the point that it&#x27;s already too late?

            Me and most of my friends had credit cards when we were in grad school. Amex had that student blue card issued.

            Young women are less likely to sign up for those products or be pre-approved (b&#x2F;c lowest financial literacy levels and thus,lower awareness of products). Target market is young professional woman who missed these opportunities to build credit early.

            I&#x27;m the case of identity theft&#x2F;card #theft, credit cards provide limited liability, while debit cards do not, at least in the USA. How do you plan on protecting your customers if they want to use the card for on-line purchases and are therefore exposed to this risk? Or can you even us debit cards for online purchases?

            Hi HN, we&#x27;re Ravi and Pratik of Enerjazz (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enerjazz.tech&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enerjazz.tech&#x2F;</a>). We make battery swapping stations (like gasoline stations) for electric vehicles, swapping discharged batteries with charged batteries in 2 minutes for light commercial EVs.<p>Commercial EVs or electric rickshaws have 2 pain points. One high upfront cost of battery (can be up to 50% of the total cost of vehicle). Two, high charging downtime resulting in loss of revenue.<p>While working as an analyst covering renewable energy developments at Shell, I (Ravi) came to the conclusion that anything that makes energy storage more affordable will have the most impact in the next couple of decades. That simple thought is how the idea of Enerjazz was born. Pratik is an expert in lithium-ion batteries (PhD from German aerospace center). In 2017, we moved from Europe to India to work on developing a battery for storing solar energy.<p>One day, we were walking back to our office after having lunch at a restaurant. We saw an e-rickshaw get on a footpath and drive into a narrow lane. We followed the driver and found that there were more than 20 e-rickshaws charging there in an open area. All of those e-rickshaws had lead acid batteries. On talking to the drivers, we realized the pain they had was far greater than the pain of storing solar energy. We started talking to e-rickshaw drivers every day after lunch and decided to do something about it. We started with making affordable lithium-ion batteries for e-rickshaws. Since we joined YC in June, we have done more than 2,500 battery swaps.<p>We enable e-rickshaw drivers to increase their earnings by 80% because their downtime effectively becomes zero. We require just a 70 dollar refundable deposit (cheaper than lead acid battery) for e-rickshaw drivers. We also have a patent-pending technology that reduces the cost of lithium-ion batteries by 50%. The technology is already proven as Enerjazz batteries have completed 4M+ kilometers.<p>We look forward to your feedback!

            Super cool! I’m always super skeptical of people claiming battery improvements. Is the benefit more of the lithium ion to lead acid switch? Or swapping batteries between use? Keep up the good work. I’d love to see videos of the e-Rick shaws.

            You mean another start-up by another professor in another university on another battery chemistry :). we get that a lot. You are spot on. Almost 96% of 2M e-rickshaws in India still run on lead acid battery (because of lower upfront cost). The only way to switch them to better tech (lithium-ion) is by making it more affordable for them.

            Yeah, everything here sounds great except for &quot;We also have a patent-pending technology that reduces the cost of lithium-ion batteries by 50%.&quot;  That&#x27;s a huge claim, which would immediately be many times more valuable than your swapping business.  Is this cost reduction perhaps just vs. small-volume retail prices, in India, for specific battery formats, or some other reasonable limitation?

            Thank you so much, Jeswin. Unlike a traditional manufacturing company, we are going to be asset light though which will enable us to grow fast.<p>We started Enerjazz with the simple goal of solving our customer&#x27;s problems. We kept talking to customers just like what YC recommends. After living for many years in Amsterdam, I often had to go to many e-rickshaw driver houses in renowned ghettos (godforsaken places) of Noida to fix their chargers in the early days. This is because they did not have proper charging infrastructure and their chargers will often go bad. With swapping, we also address this issue of bad quality power access to e-rickshaw drivers.

            Thank you so much, Roshan. We are only working with e-rickshaws at the moment but plan to take the model to electric scooters (Zomato&#x2F;Swiggy delivery fleets) soon. We believe commercial EVs will be the first ones to adopt swapping because they loose revenue when they have to charge in the day time.

            Hi, we’re Rob, April and Ivan, cofounders of DigiBuild (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digibuild.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digibuild.com&#x2F;</a>). We build construction software powered by blockchain. Our tools help large companies, like VCC Construction, improve the schedule and budget on projects and save over a million dollars annually.<p>I grew up in construction with my dad and saw first hand the issues companies face everyday. The building process involves 50-100 stakeholders (ie. suppliers, contractors, architects) who suffer from low margins and work on projects that fail 70% of the time. Large builds create upwards of 750,000 documents. It is very complex and costly to manage them.<p>For every physical construction process that occurs, an “intangible asset” like a workflow or piece of data is created as well. Current software solutions offer some efficiency but fall short because they’re centralized databases or data silos with no transparency. From a risk management perspective, each construction stakeholder needs to review, verify, or otherwise build trust manually to make sure they’re protected (i.e. let me double check that document so I know you didn’t screw me over). The trust established with blockchain allows us to codify many of those processes and touch points, making them automated and giving more line of sight to construction teams. This is possible because unlike a centralized database, the blockchain is not owned&#x2F;monopolized by any party and it is auditable so transactions can be verified by all the stakeholders. This meets their risk management requirements to do business.<p>We have multiple tools solving customer pain, including a construction management platform for managing any project workflow; a procurement product to find, order, and track building material; and a payment product to streamline the collection of payment documentation and disbursements. Without blockchain, these workflows involve suppliers, subcontractors, general contractors all sending contracts, invoices, and data sheets back and forth. This is manual trust-building which adds time, costs, and risk. Using smart contracts allows us to codify these processes, automating 90% of them for all of the parties and providing more transparency.<p>Our team has managed over $5B in construction projects. I’m also the former CEO of a nationwide construction company and our engineering team has worked on projects alongside Coinbase, IBM, Iota, and Linux.<p>We would love to hear from you and hear feedback. We’re especially excited to be challenged and to brainstorm around our use of blockchain in this market - we know HN has a wide spectrum of views on that, on both sides of the ledger!

            We&#x27;ve heard that a few times. In the future, there definitely could be usage in other markets. Right now we&#x27;re lazer focused on our construction customers though:)<p>Competitor wise there are 2 types:

            Thanks! Yes we believe it is revolutionary as well. However, blockchain + construction is not the first use case you think of here and we know lots of companies have tried to slap blockchain on any use case.<p>It makes sense here though because The building process involves 50 dis-trusting stakeholders who suffer from low margins and work on projects that fail 70% of the time. They also create upwards of 750,000 documents which is complex and costly to manage.
 Companies on these projects send a lot of important information, and data to each other; blockchain creates a trusted digital environment that these companies can collaborate in.

            Right now, our products are built using Hyperledger Fabric or R3 Corda. In the future, as public blockchains like Ethereum and Avalanche scale and become proven in business use cases, we will migrate over to them, becoming fully decentralized and utilizing a consensus mechanism like Proof of Stake or Gossip Networks.
Short term, we needed to use enterprise blockchain that was proven in a business setting and doesn’t have scaling issues; our customers risk management needs dictated our decisions. Hyperledger Fabric and similar blockchains use a consensus called PBFT that serves our purpose of “trust minimization” needed to provide benefits to construction end users that can&#x27;t be done in a system that has no trust.<p>A centralized database wouldn&#x27;t work here because:
1)It is owned by 1 company, there is no transparency into what is happening with the data. Lack of immutability and provenance of data matters here.
2)Not auditable. No way to prove or verify the transactions without the database owner approving.<p>These issues prevent that centralized database from giving end users from both a behavioral and technical perspective.

        <div class="body">
            Hi HN. My name is Mustafa Al-Adhami. I am the founder and CEO of Astek Diagnositcs Inc. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astekdx.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astekdx.com</a>). We have a platform to determine antibiotic sensitivity in one hour.<p>Every year, 1.7 million Americans are evaluated for sepsis - and too many die while waiting days for the correct antibiotic. Imagine a one-day-old baby having to wait twice as long as they have been alive to receive accurate treatment. Or a cancer patient with bad immunity receiving 3 random antibiotics that might or might not work. This is a huge problem and I had an idea on how to fix it.<p>Every product in the market relies on identifying the bacteria to know what kills it. We thought, why care what the antibiotic is if you know what is killing it? We can do that by detecting the metabolic rate of the bacteria rather relying on phenotypic or genotypic methods--and, believe it or not, by mimicking the digestive system of mosquitoes.<p>I have a PhD in mechanical engineering with a focus on blood mechanics. Prior to my PhD I did customer discovery for 7 years. One day (my first day on a jet ski!) I got attacked by mosquitoes and had to rush home. The next day I went to the lab where I got bit by a mosquito again. I looked at the bite and noticed a sparkle on the bite spot. I looked it up and realized it was my blood plasma because mosquitoes urinate the plasma after digesting the red blood cells. This is exactly what I had been trying to do for years. I mimicked the digestive system of the mosquito and I got the missing piece of the product.<p>Astek’s first product will be the Eugris, a benchtop analyzer that can identify the presence of a bacterial infection in the blood and then perform antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of the bacterium in one hour. To accomplish this, a microfluidics device removes the blood cells from the plasma that would contain bacteria and adds resazurin, a fluorescence indicator. These steps take 25 minutes. In the presence of live bacteria, resazurin is reduced to resorufin, which is higher in fluorescence, by reacting with NADH, a ubiquitous intermediate in the metabolic process. The sample is monitored fluorometrically for 15 minutes, and metabolic activity is shown by an increase in fluorescence. The technique has been shown capable of detecting bacterial infection at a level of 10 CFU&#x2F;mL (colony-forming-units). Antibiotic susceptibility can be assessed by incubating the plasma with antibiotics, where ineffective antibiotics fail to reduce metabolic activity while effective antibiotics diminish metabolic activity.<p>We have a prototype in testing in a clinical setting. Our initial target market will be clinical labs tasked with performing diagnostic tests for patients suspected of sepsis or septic shock. For these patients, rapid initiation of the correct antibiotic therapy is crucial: every hour of delay increases mortality by 7-8%. Currently, the gold standard for AST relies on blood culture, and takes 2-7 days to deliver results to the clinician. Most patients don&#x27;t have that long.

            Hi HN! We are a rather unusual team of six founders (Pei, Amit, Sunil, Jack, Bo, and Kartik) spread across India and China, building Karbon Cards (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karboncard.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karboncard.com&#x2F;</a>). We help companies in India get instant access to a corporate card.<p>We came across this problem separately while Amit was doing VC and Sunil was running his own fintech. We saw that a startup with $1M in the bank was facing mind-numbing issues in getting a card with a $5k limit. After speaking to finance managers in other companies of all ages and sizes, we realized the problem was massive. Seeing Brex at the same time growing so quickly gave us the kick to go out and figure out a way to solve this issue.<p>Before Karbon card, our customers were either using personal cards for company&#x27;s card expenses or put a fixed deposit at a bank to get an equivalent credit limit on a card. Both options are painful in the long run: using personal cards leads to compliance issues, and putting a fixed deposit for a card locks your growth capital. Since we are a free product (we make money on interchange fees) and onboarding is simple, it is better to get a no-hassle corporate card from us.<p>Today we have a solution wherein a company completes a 10 minute application process and gets access to a virtual credit card right away. We are known across India’s startup community for quick card issuance (10 minutes vs 5 weeks), 10x higher credit limits compared to banks, and self-serve controls that help reign in unnecessary spending. We’ve also launched a vendor payment product that makes banking less cumbersome moving towards our longer term vision of becoming the only financial product a company would need to run it’s business aka India’s first corporate Neo bank.<p>Companies today use our product to run their marketing campaigns, infrastructure spends, pay SaaS vendors and take care of employee reimbursements. We work with clients who are as young as 2 weeks old to publicly listed companies in India. That alone shows the depth of the problem and the need for a company like us to help make corporate spending easier--it is the last thing a company should be blocked on.<p>Some of our customers are creatively using our card in ways that we have not even imagined. Our customer, Rajat, runs a marketing agency, and he issued himself 120 Karbon cards. He gave these cards to his clients and asked them to top up their cards to run Facebook ads. Another customer, Akshay, uses his card and payment product to process salaries and make vendor payments.<p>Please share your thoughts and questions and comments!

            Me and my current co-founder did face this issues or atleast were discussing about this issues. It is a big problem. Also, problem is india is just simply incorporating a company.<p>It becomes even more difficult when both the founders do not live in India. Relevant problem, huge market. Good luck! We will probably be a customer if you guys execute well. One of the things that I love about brex and if you could replicate would set you apart is customer experience. If you build some very customer centric that would completely change the game.

            Thank you for your valuable feedback.<p>It is difficult to incorporate a company in India, especially if you need it to make a subsidiary of an Indian company.<p>We are planning to add bank accounts in the near future. Our existing customers use virtual bank accounts accounts to transfer salaries and vendor payments.

            We have a number of proprietorship as customers, and they like us. They use our card for digital marketing spends, SAS payments, and telecom payments. Few of our customers do not want to put their main bank&#x27;s debit card on online portals, and they prefer to put our cards as it comes with numerous controls.<p>Since our card is free of cost, there is nothing to lose and everything to gain.<p>If you do not have a CIN, please enter your GST number in the field.<p>Below are the steps to apply for the card.

            Hi HN, we are Manas, Swapnil and Sailesh, co-founders of AlgoUniversity (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.algouniversity.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.algouniversity.com&#x2F;</a>). We bridge the gap between the CS curriculum taught at universities in India and the skills that are required by the tech industry. We offer live classes, industry-relevant projects, and learning products that prepare students for software engineering jobs at top tech companies.<p>We started AlgoUniversity in our final year of college. Both Manas and I (Swapnil) were interested less in our academics and more in software engineering, products and things going around us. After securing internships&#x2F;placements at Alphagrep and Apple respectively, we started working on side ideas&#x2F;jobs. Manas taught a dozen students during college for interviews that helped them to land jobs, and realized that he could scale it. I had started working in an ed-tech startup where I was training students to get into Google through Google’s own program for these students called WTEF. After successfully placing 2 students at Google and helping the rest get offers from other tech companies like Microsoft, Gojek, Oracle etc., I realised that there was a gap between what edtech startups were doing and what could be achieved if proper focus were put on quality education, upskilling and first-principle problem solving. There is a better way to prepare for interviews and be a natural problem solver (and hence good at job) than mugging up GFG and Leetcode problems!<p>We went on to start AlgoUniversity, starting from one batch of 25 students last year from two tier II colleges in India, and achieved good placement results for our first batch: 100% placement, 21 LPA avg CTC (1.5x more than top universities in India), 3 people placed in Google, 3 getting Bytedance Intl offers. The international offers were big for us as students apart from tier 1 colleges in India don&#x27;t have exposure to international jobs and their hiring process. We have now started to take in more students and multiple batches from this year onwards.<p>The thing that differentiates us from existing solutions in this space is our product-led approach: we have built a suite of microproducts that develop this problem solving attitude from scratch, simulate the actual interview experience and so on. We still have a lot to do in terms of scaling our teaching infrastructure to multiple batches, partnering with companies for hiring and hitting product-market fit. We have described some of our experiences here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.algouniversity.com&#x2F;blogdetail&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.algouniversity.com&#x2F;blogdetail&#x2F;</a>, if anyone is interested.<p>Thanks for reading. We would love to hear your thoughts and experiences regarding the above, or finding jobs or interview prep or hiring candidates. We are also live on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.algouniversity.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.algouniversity.com</a>. Please share your feedback with us!
