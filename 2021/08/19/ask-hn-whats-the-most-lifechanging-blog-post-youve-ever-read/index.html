            7 years ago I had just aborted an internship, my foray into being an employed adult, because I found myself unable to deal with disagreements. Contrary to my naive hope that the confidence boost from being a Professional Software Developer(tm) would solve all my emotional problems I now knew that my limitations would follow me around anywhere I would go. But I had no idea how to change and was too stuck in my own anxiety and arrogance to ask for help.<p>Around that time I Somehow stumbled upon this[1] article on how to make a Buddhist bone trumpet. It took me completely by surprise, the topic, the author, the tone, the context of Buddhism, nothing fit together like I expected. It was the most absurd thing I ever read and I kept laughing, at the same time it felt utterly genuine. My curiosity piqued I read the other less bizarre articles from the author about Buddhism and life in general. It dawned on me that my attempt at completely controlling my life had, in fact, caused me to lose control over it. The process of learning to accept unpredictability and open myself to the world, that started the evening I read that article, was by no means always this fun, but looking back boy was it worth it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buddhism-for-vampires.com&#x2F;kangling-chod" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buddhism-for-vampires.com&#x2F;kangling-chod</a>

            Warning: Buddhism redox and incomplete ahead. The purpose of what I write is to whet your appetite and maybe spark an interest for a personal journey. I strongly advise and even recommend a proper introduction. I suggest D T Suzuki and Alan Watts for their introduction to Zen. Amazing vulgarisers of these concepts. Watts&#x27; lectures are available on YouTube.<p>In the Buddhist philosophy the notion that you can control anything other than yourself is considered absurd. Even conceding that you have control over yourself is being generous. A need for control then becomes a major source of frustration, or as it&#x27;s often referred to in this context, dissatisfaction or suffering. By studying the philosophy, you gradually untangle the absurdity and you progressively start to see the theory be manifested in reality. You then learn to accept it and see the absurdity of your own desire for control.<p>I can say that to you and it might make sense. But that&#x27;s still at the theoretical level. For it to be true to you, you need to make the journey yourself.

            I tried so hard to make everything go as I wanted that I increasingly avoided situations where I couldn&#x27;t predict how they would go. That included stuff like talking about my feelings or asking for a favor or eventually going grocery shopping(anything could happen!! ;). Of course those are all pretty useful things and my difficulty with them convinced me even more that I had to absolutely make sure I had covered every eventuality.

            Why do you need to understand this sentence? So that you can  use that new knowledge to alter the set of concepts that you have of life, ideally improving them, so that you are more able to control your life, to steer it in a better direction? Because you want to be alright? The point is to let go

            I&#x27;m intrigued because at first it appears to be a paradoxical statement, but with a potentially logical answer.<p>In addition to that though, I think I (and others?) make sense of the world through narrative and there is value to other people&#x27;s narratives, though that may be in conflict with the context of your comment.

            It&#x27;s a Zen game he&#x27;s playing with you :). The point is to let go, but letting go can also become a pursuit, in which case you&#x27;re not really letting go. You&#x27;re right about the paradox, you&#x27;re possibility wrong about the existence of a logical answer.

            The idea of controlling ones life presupposes that there is  “one”, that is separate from life, so that the “one” can control life. It presupposes some kind of separation in the field of experience.

These things make me feel good, but it does not generate real value. In order to get rich, I need to create things. I also start to realize that great people are great because they started to create things at a very early stage of their life (but not consuming things as they advocate, think about celebrities, entrepreneurs etc), so they are able to practice and perfect the value creating skills to the extreme.<p>2) I start to realize that the world is binary in nature : I create to sell, I buy to consume. I either at the buyer side, or at the seller side. And in this current society, there is a huge buyer side trap, the whole idea of consumerism and social media is to trap you inside the buyer side, so you keep buying, you keep consuming. I really need to break free from this trap.<p>This blog post was written before COVID-19, but the idea feels even fresher during this pandemic era

            I don&#x27;t agree with the overall take that the world is binary in that way at all..<p>You create to sell? No, I think a fundamental part, for example of art, is that it can be created for no reason whatsoever. To give a personal example, I really enjoy music production and playing piano.. but I do it only for myself and have fun doing so.. i don&#x27;t even share it with anyone. Does that mean I am creating but not selling? And does that mean it is wrong and a waste of my time and I should stop doing it? No, I&#x27;m just creating for the sake of creating.<p>Another thing I don&#x27;t understand, is your end goal in life to get rich? And do you equal being rich with being happy?<p>That&#x27;s not my worldview at all. I mainly care about three things, curiosity, ethics and empathy. But definitely curiosity, being able to learn everyday is what makes me happy. But that doesn&#x27;t fit into what your explaining, I don&#x27;t have to create and sell anything with what I&#x27;ve learned because the act of learning already gives me happiness.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m the weird one but I truly find that a life with the sole goal of selling and accruing wealth seems boring.

            &gt;I realized that reading a book was really just like reading Reddit—both were consumptive activitives.<p>I disagree on this but I love and agree with the premise of the blog post. Comparing reddit to Moby Dick could not be further off. reddit (or any similar site) is a shill&#x2F;bad actor&#x2F;agitator&#x2F;troll cesspool full of memes and clickbait.<p>It is important to learn to tell good shit from bad shit. Consume things produced by masters of their craft. Try not to settle for less, you have limited time here. Use this to create more.

            The quality of consumption is different for sure, but I would argue that certain areas of reddit are of high value to my job, hobbies, etc. and Moby Dick is of little value those areas and quality of life in general. You could perhaps make arguments about historical value, context, or benefits to reading comprehension, but at the end of the day, reading anything is about only as good as the information you&#x27;re taking in.

            I will respectfully disagree that it leads to a more &#x27;full life&#x27; for everyone. People have different perspectives, values, etc. and that type of experience is purely subjective. I personally think it&#x27;s of some value, but not as much as some other content.

            While I do agree with your first point, I think it&#x27;s a bit .. obvious. Of course you need to create value in order to be great (or get rich).<p>Regarding the article, it doesn&#x27;t match my experience. All the prolific creators I know (about) are prolific consumers as well. Writers are known to read a lot. The girl the author saw sketching on the bus probably loves looking at and reading about art and does it often as well as actually creating art.<p>The other issue is the amount of creative effort you can spend. For example, software engineering is a very creative job and often at the end of the day I just have no energy left to create more.

            &gt; And in this current society, there is a huge buyer side trap, the whole idea of consumerism and social media is to trap you inside the buyer side, so you keep buying, you keep consuming.<p>Aside from bankruptcy, buying and selling are actually completely balanced in a modern market economy. Even “saving” money is actually best considered as selling it. Earning money is obviously selling your time and bodily energy (those are the only finite things you have that are inputs into the system).<p>Borrowing is selling your future money to someone who wants to take on the risk.

            If you keep reading murakami and Dan brown, sure you’re just juggling words for no real benefit. But if you’re gonna read the making of the atomic bomb, or team of teams, then maybe it’s not a wasteful exercise. Definitely better than writing if you ask me.

            Disagree on this. I used to only read non-fiction, but these days, I feel like reading fiction (especially literary fiction) and having different experiences and empathizing with characters is more beneficial and relevant to my life in _general_ (obviously not always the case). Plus there are no limits to the realities that can be created in fiction, so there are some creative (and escapist) benefits there as well.<p>I&#x27;m not saying fiction is objectively more &quot;beneficial&quot; than non-fiction, I&#x27;m just saying the opposite isn&#x27;t necessarily true either.

            I think those of us with leisure time or &quot;bullshit&quot; work struggle with these questions, but I find that the consumption&#x2F;creation dichotomy is the wrong approach. Arguably almost everything is consumptive in some capacity, from creating art (which is indulgent and pleasurable) to unnecessary programs (they&#x27;re all unnecessary) or any other passtime. I would further reduce the problem to one of stimulus and desire. Execution and completion of tasks is in itself cognitively satisfying, that&#x27;s in part why smartphone games can be so addictive, you can &quot;fake&quot; the experience in rapid fashion. The mechanism behind the dopamine release etc doesn&#x27;t care about the context behind it, that is an existential problem. We like the flow experience. That can be &quot;deep&quot; work, or not.<p>The question of meaning behind our actions is one divorced from this, and obviously not so easily determined as whether or not an action is creative. Some of the most effective altruistic actions are boring. I&#x27;m of the type that has short bouts of investigative interest in certain topics, and that wanes, so I can&#x27;t count on merely my &quot;mood&quot; to finish projects. I had read anecdotally that authors in particular seem to derive satisfaction from having completed a work, and find that driving themselves to finish it can be torturous. I feel that way about my projects.<p>Personally, it&#x27;s a good day if I&#x27;ve &quot;executed&quot; and completed a lot at work. There is no objective reason why this ought to be better than those days where I struggle to finish a single assignment, but that is human nature. You can satisfy such a creature with social validation and the feedback of completing tasks, until maybe you broach the problem of meaning. I wonder how many of us in the future will spend most of our time dwelling in virtual worlds where nothing is real. If we do, then meaning is cheap.

            I agree with others, there is no one thing that is going to change your life. You get there via experience. Experiencing the consequences at 30 of something may feel profound despite the fact your parents told you the same thing 100 times as a youth.<p>My advice is this: <i>Introspection is a super power.</i> The more you take the time to step back and reevaluate all of your actions&#x2F;assumptions in life, the more you will be able to make meaningful change towards the life you want from <i>NOW</i>.<p>Also, find purpose outside of your career, find a hobby or cause and find fulfillment there. Corollary, if you are going to have regrets, regret doing something, don&#x27;t regret not doing it.

It greatly simplifies cooking because it&#x27;s automated. Just add the ingredients, close the lid, press a button, and wait. You will get a perfectly cooked one-pot meal with minimum effort. You can even mix fresh and frozen ingredients and the timer won&#x27;t start until the frozen ingredients are thawed. If you don&#x27;t overfill it the only thing the food touches is the inner stainless steel pot, so it&#x27;s very easy to clean. I get the majority of my nutrition from food cooked this way. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to slow traditional methods.<p>It also makes dried legumes far more practical, because you can skip the pre-soak phase. If you eat a lot of legumes, and you switch from canned to dried, the savings will most likely pay for the cost of the machine within a few years. In addition, energy costs are reduced because cooking at increased pressure is faster, and good electric pressure cookers are insulated. I am happy with an Instant Pot brand one, although I don&#x27;t guarantee they are the best. If somebody has strong opinions on which is best then please post them.<p>The one major downside is the texture of the food can become boring, because everything is mixed together and you can&#x27;t make crispy foods with it, but you can always add things like pickles after you&#x27;ve cooked it.

            First time I see this post (thanks for sharing!). I bought one of these 2 years ago and it was life changing indeed. Stuffing it with vegetables and meat before going to the gym; come back and everything is done.<p>About boring food; it might not be crispy, but you can make amazing meats in it. Try slow cooking pork collar boneless[0] with honey and mustard.

            Sous vide for all the hype has had similar benefits for me. Some recipes can take a long time, but same as on an electric pressure cooker things are completely automated and hands off. There&#x27;s no need to monitor or stir, and the results are always great and always repeatable. Chicken breasts are always perfect, salmon, steak, etc... (also works on some veggie recipes)

            Pressure cooking is very common in some countries, but I&#x27;m only familiar with the simple mechanical pressure cookers (that work on gas or induction stoves). Can electric pressure cookers do things that a regular one can&#x27;t?

            It&#x27;s not a matter of what it can do, but of safety&#x2F;ease of use. I used a traditional pressure cooker for many years, but nowadays I see no reason to go back to babysitting the cooking process. Waiting for pressure to build? Deciding when it&#x27;s done and lowering the stove to maintenance pressure? Setting an alarm, and then making the pot stop cooking? Nah, just set the timer at the very beginning and go for a walk.

            Many electric pressure cookers double or triple as other similar devices, e.g. rice cookers. Also, you can fry stuff in them before you start the pressure cooking phase (maybe you can do that in other devices, too, I don&#x27;t know).<p>In general I would say that the temperature control in an electric pressure cooker is going to be more precise, so you see functions like yogurt making in them, too.

            Phytohaemagglutinin is destroyed by sufficient heating. It is a serious danger with slow cookers, but not with pressure cookers. The FDA publishes a book on food safety:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;Food&#x2F;FoodborneIllnessContaminants&#x2F;UCM297627.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;Food&#x2F;FoodborneIllnessContamina...</a><p>&quot;PHA is destroyed by adequate cooking. Some variation in toxin stability has been found at different temperatures. However, Bender and Readi found that boiling the beans for 10 minutes (100°C) completely destroyed the toxin. Consumers should boil the beans for at least 30 minutes to ensure that the product reaches sufficient temperature, for a sufficient amount of time, to completely destroy the toxin.&quot;

            If you&#x27;re susceptible to that effect then presoaking will help, but susceptibility depends on your individual microbiome. Some vegans use the liquid that chickpeas were cooked in as an egg substitute (&quot;aquafaba&quot;). I personally drain the liquid off after cooking, and don&#x27;t notice any problems.

If you post &quot;maybe not&quot; or &quot;not really&quot; maybe refrain from posting?

            Every time I see something like this I have two answers: none and all. On one hand, &quot;life changing&quot; is a big word and I have never read anything that I could possibly say had as big an impact on me as, say, having children. It&#x27;s hard to imagine articles and books are life changing, only that they can contribute to life changing actions.<p>On the other, nearly everything I&#x27;ve read has changed me and how I saw the world, even ever so slightly. Different perspectives, bits of knowledge, connections made that I&#x27;m not even aware of. So I guess I just have to assume that everyone&#x27;s definition of &quot;life changing&quot; is going to be quite wide depending on their own life experience and attitudes.

            &gt; On the other, nearly everything I&#x27;ve read has changed me and how I saw the world, even ever so slightly.<p>Same here. The discrete life-changing stuff in my life have been things that happened to me or someone close to me.<p>Not stuff I&#x27;ve read. But the stuff I&#x27;ve read stay with me and have definitely changed my perspective, affected how I approach things etc.<p>So rather than reading a particular blog post, I&#x27;d say: read lots!

            &gt; If you post &quot;maybe not&quot; or &quot;not really&quot; maybe refrain from posting?<p>Sometimes people use hedging language like this because they’re being vulnerable beyond their comfort level. So even though a post might truly have been life changing for them they brace for someone responding with a dismissive or snarky comment by hedging with “maybe not really” type words. It’s a form of self-protection, in a way.<p>So I fear your comment could very likely discourage people who were already on the fence about sharing, perhaps even sharing something interesting. So I say, the more the merrier! Who knows what might be life changing for someone. I definitely didn’t expect to open this thread and read a blog post about bone trumpets but I’m really glad I did.

            I&#x27;m really bad at closing old browser tabs, but Firefox was getting sluggish, so it was time. I started bookmarking interesting article, then realized something: I had significantly more things to read than things to do. What&#x27;s the point of all this reading if I&#x27;m not going to put it to use?

            &gt; You can be in the back seat and travel to a place a hundred times. But until you take the driver&#x27;s seat you&#x27;ll never know the way.<p>I know this phenomenon well. In fact, when we moved into our new house which was an easy drive from where we used to live, I drove here half a dozen times using the GPS and still had no idea where I was going until I forced myself to do the trip without turning the GPS on.

            I would say &quot;career changing&quot; more than &quot;life changing&quot;, but I just wrote a post that shows the longevity of Joel Spolsky&#x27;s writing.  People are still confused today about things he explained well 15-20 years ago:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;spolsky.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;spolsky.html</a><p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever read a <i>single</i> life-changing blog post, but an entire blog over years and books can definitely be life changing.<p>I&#x27;d say that life-changing stuff has to be contrarian, and Taleb and PG are pretty contrarian.  This also means they can be wrong, repetitive, and piss a lot of people off.  You can criticize individual posts or passages easily; it&#x27;s harder to do that of their entire career.<p>I&#x27;d also be careful to label them &quot;not contrarian&quot; -- contrarians can seem less so once people start agreeing with and imitating them, specifically as a result of the writing :)

            I participated in the Prosopagnosia study at Imperial a few years ago.

I believe I have the cadence and rhythm of sounds, but it&#x27;s not really easy to get words that way.<p>Yes, isn&#x27;t this what pretty much everyone experiences, unless they have one of these listed disorders? If you can think in words, watch a TV show and later picture what the characters look like, and listen to a song and have it get &quot;stuck in your head&quot;, then I think you have an internal monologue and don&#x27;t have aphantasia.

            &gt; I wonder if anyone in the world has both conditions. That would be interesting to understand how they think.<p>I think maybe I do? I’ve know about the aphantasia and it wasn’t surprising to me because I always felt like I was missing something when people used phrases like “picture $thing in your mind” but now you’re telling me everyone is <i>talking to themselves</i> in their heads, too? It’s actually so hard for me to wrap my head around I think I must be misunderstanding...

            I think you and some others probably are misunderstanding. It&#x27;s the idea that sometimes when you think, you &quot;think with words&quot;. It&#x27;s the presence or employment of words or language anywhere in your thinking.<p>Not &quot;hearing&quot; the words or necessarily &quot;talking to yourself&quot; or hearing someone talk to you. I think many people do mentally talk to themselves, but I think that&#x27;s a sufficient condition to have an internal monologue rather than a necessary condition.<p>People who don&#x27;t have it would 100% of the time only ever think about things in terms of visual imagery, symbols, or something else abstract. I believe it&#x27;s quite rare.

            This one I’ve always been extremely skeptical of.

            I still can’t quite believe there are people who can see clear images in their minds. Maybe it’s more a matter of how you report your experience?<p>I’m very conscious of how poor my mental images are, but maybe with a little less introspection I would also say I have great mental imagery.

            I do think variances in reporting are some of it. I have some visualization skills and wouldn&#x27;t claim to be &quot;aphantasic&quot;, but on the flip side, there is an enormous dividing line between real-world images and these imagined images. While awake I would never confuse the two.<p>I also suspect a lot of people are massively overreporting the quality of their images. It&#x27;s very easy to imagine something and <i>think</i> you understand it, until asked to produce something based on it. This isn&#x27;t just limited to mental images, it&#x27;s the source of the &quot;why don&#x27;t you &#x27;just&#x27;...&quot; questions, and comes up all the time in building, engineering, artistic endeavors, etc. Your brain is easily convinced it has a thought with more detail than it actually has. I really only trust people who have taken a lot of time to train the relevant system if they claim they have these things. For instance, I really can design some somewhat non-trivial programs in my head... but I&#x27;ve been doing this for ~25 years, and only recently would I say I&#x27;m getting to the point where these designs are sometimes good enough that they&#x27;re not taking serious body blows betwixt conceptualization and realization.

            What&#x27;s more convincing to me than self report of image quality is self report of imagery use. Whether it should be described as aphantasia I don&#x27;t know, but I never think in a visuospatial way unless I consciously stop and try because the problem really requires it (and even then I feel I&#x27;m pretty bad). On the other hand I have friends that describe their ideas in such a visual way almost instantly, and report having imagery pop into their heads naturally.<p>To me it seems really obvious that relative to my internal monologue, my imagery is much weaker and quantifiably less frequent. So I think at least people that report having imagery much stronger than internal monologue likely have something different going on for real, not just with reporting.

            Well, the image moves when you try to trace it, because your eyes are jumping around. Then, when you&#x27;ve got a wrong line, your brain tries to fit the imagined image to the wrong line by skewing it, which it does in <i>several different ways</i> once you&#x27;ve got enough wrong lines, so the wrong lines multiply.<p>A skilled artist can work around this, by drawing the right lines (and erasing &#x2F; ignoring the wrong lines).

            Visualization is a bit confusing in the sense that I can perfectly &quot;see&quot; someone&#x27;s image in my mind or on the piece of paper, but I cannot draw it that well.

            I&#x27;m aphantasic, and I&#x27;d say one advantage is that I&#x27;m not bothered by invasive vivid memories or anxiety inducing imagery. Just on a hunch, I think aphantasics are probably less likely to develop PTSD after trauma, as a big component of PTSD appears to be just this kind of pervasive, invasive and hyper-vivid memories. I sometimes feel that I&#x27;m missing out on something, but from experiences on psychedelics, which give me closed-eye visuals of geometric shapes and colors which don&#x27;t go away until the effects pass, I think I prefer the still black void and relative mental silence (apart from the soundless inner monologue) of aphantasia to a &#x27;richer&#x27; inner world that I&#x27;m not able to shut off. Would be happy to get other aphantasics&#x27; (as well as hyperphantasics at the other end of the spectrum) perspective on this

            I&#x27;m curious what you mean by &quot;soundless inner monologue&quot;? I don&#x27;t really experience much imagery at all but my inner monologue feels very close to how talking to myself aloud feels, so I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as soundless. The verbal vividness of my internal monologue is actually how I imagined people with good imagery skills &quot;see&quot;.<p>On the note of advantages, I know I have something weird going on with the back right of my brain specifically (focal slowing on EEG among other things), which I am pretty certain connects to my favoring of verbal over visual thinking. So I guess it depends on the cause of a case of aphantasia, but to me it feels a little like how blind people end up with heightened hearing. I think I&#x27;ve really developed strong verbal skills because of it, and there are definitely advantages to having strong verbal skills.<p>I recall a professor showing us a study once where students performed better on an exam when they were allowed&#x2F;encouraged to talk out loud to themselves while they were taking it. He was encouraging us to talk through stuff with ourselves, but at first I found the result weird because I assumed everybody was always talking to themselves in their head. That was the first time it really dawned on me there may be large individual differences in how we experience thoughts.

            That salary one is great, I’ve used similar strategies to help people negotiate pretty large bumps when interviewing. It’s funny to see the sophistication of the recruiter on the other side (while they’re pretending not to be).<p>One social thing I learned though is that some people are weird about it - not the recruiters but the friends you’re trying to help negotiate. They’re afraid to do it and instead rationalize how it won’t work and then get angry if you try to persuade them that it’s possible.

            That is why I like those articles, they allow me to pass the links without trying to convince people.
Folks tend to find it easier to borrow wisdom from people further from their network.

            You might want to rethink aligning your life to a <i>Cracked</i> listicle, in particular this one. For example:<p>&gt; <i>For instance, some people want to respond to that speech with Tyler Durden&#x27;s line from Fight Club: &quot;You are not your job.&quot; But, well, actually, you totally are.</i><p>Well, actually, you totally aren&#x27;t. The next part is even worse and downright dehumanizing:<p>&gt; <i>you are nothing more than the sum total of your useful skills [...] Your &quot;job&quot; -- the useful thing you do for other people -- is all you are.</i><p>It&#x27;s not a good idea to view yourself as purely a means to an end for other people. I&#x27;m strongly in favor of being a useful and productive part of society, but not to the point where nothing remains of your person except for an exploitable resource for others.

            Having just read it for the first time, I&#x27;d characterize that article as the metaphorical slap to bring someone to their senses.

            Thanks, that&#x27;s an insightful take on it. You bring up a good point, which is that reading this article can be healthy for some people, and unhealthy for others.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a solution for this, because any kind of disclaimer would dilute its message for those that need to hear it, and do nothing for those that shouldn&#x27;t hear it. And what would such a disclaimer even look like? &quot;Disregard this article if you&#x27;re not an entitled, selfish man-child&quot;?

            I generally agree and don&#x27;t know how well this holds up, but reading this article when I was around 20 really broke me out of some entitlement and helped me start working on myself.

            The article is absolutely perfect for its audience, which is the smirking, early-20s Internet user of 10 years ago that read Cracked, or Maddox and spent their time on Digg and Reddit. You know the type.<p>I remember the impact it had when it came out. It was the reality check that a lot of people in that age range needed, especially new college graduates. This was the era of the &quot;jobless recovery&quot; of post-2008, when S&amp;P500 was going up but underemployment was very high. You have to learn to drop a lot of ego when your fancy degree has you working at the same Starbucks as a kid straight out of high school.

            I know the article is intentionally provocative and over the top to provoke a reaction... whether it&#x27;s a healthy reflection on your attitude to success or crippling self-loathing probably depends on the reader.<p>Also, there are undeniably some hard truths hidden in there. However, my experience in almost 20 years in the tech&#x2F;software&#x2F;product industry often paints a different picture. Yes, our brains keep us from changing and evolving and yes, obviously you need skills to be successful in life and your career. But in my industry in particular, hard and soft skills are not the dominant factor that keeps individuals from succeeding or progressing. I&#x27;m lucky enough to work with an abundance of talent and skill, and yet, one of the major factors of dissatisfaction is lack of &quot;progression&quot;. One of the main factors is self-confidence and in the more severe cases even mental health issues. Some of the most skilled and knowledgeable engineers I worked with struggled to realise their potential because of it. If the leaders in your organisation think they can just shout at them to &quot;learn self-confidence as a skill&quot; and get over it you&#x27;re going to have a bad time. It will attract a certain type and employee that thrives in that environment and disengage everyone else. Wasting talent, wasting skills and ultimately a lot of money. 
Creating an environment and learning how to tease the potential out of skilled and talented individuals is not a &quot;hippie&#x2F;hipster&quot; thing to do, it is good for business.

            Maybe the Glengarry Glen Ross &quot;closing&quot; scene would have a positive impact on me and get me fired up if the profession was something in tech, at a company whose mission I cared about.

            This is my absolute favorite essay of all time. I actually have it set to my default tab whenever I open a web browser, because I try to make sure I read it as often as I can.<p>&gt; To complaints of a job poorly done, one often hears the excuse, “I am not responsible.” I believe that is literally correct. The man who takes such a stand in fact is not responsible; he is irresponsible. While he may not be legally liable, or the work may not have been specifically assigned to him, no one involved in a job can divest himself of responsibility for its successful completion.

            &gt; Unless the individual truly responsible can be identified when something goes wrong, no one has really been responsible. With the advent of modern management theories it is becoming common for organizations to deal with problems in a collective manner, by dividing programs into subprograms, with no one left responsible for the entire effort.<p>I was quite literally thinking about this exact problem at my organization last week.

But really, there are red and blue Englishes that are prominent, using the same words but that mean very different things.  EG: Blue defines racism as something that cant happen to a majority.  Red doesnt.  They dont really acknowledge that the other is using the word to describe something different, they just call each other the word used from their own understanding, and then call the other side stupid.  Through whistles, code switching, and signaling, phrases are now so detached from their meaning, that not speaking the language is almost assuredly an inability to interact with parts of the tribe, in any capacity more than the most superficial.  In groups can have conversations where it sounds like they are saying one thing, but under the surface is a completely different conversation.  Just imagine what the phrase &quot;covid isnt real&quot; (or &quot;black lives matter [too&#x2F;more]&quot;) means to you.  If you read it ultra literally, you probably arent quite understanding what the speaker means.

            I wish I could find it.<p>It was a blog post about how one man&#x27;s perspective on fatherhood changed after he became a father, and he realized he regretted waiting so long, because all it really ended up doing was robbing him of being able to spend more time with his children.<p>Before reading it, I was ambivalent about whether I wanted children.

            Maybe tone the superlatives down.  I am not sure there are &quot;life-changing&quot; blog posts.  Maybe a post that is either illuminating to a new way of thinking or point you in another direction.<p>To be clear - I support the idea of sharing insightful information especially as everyone takes different paths of life.  I do however loathe the over the top language.  This day and age everything is &quot;life-changing&quot;, &quot;epic&quot;, &quot;GOAT&quot; - its devalues the rest of the content.

            I went hard on this for 8 or 9 years for the start of my career.  Now with a kid and a house FIRE is on the back burner, but I still saved a ton of money.  If I were to never save another cent and just rely on growth on what I have, I&#x27;d still have a secure &quot;normal&quot; retirement fund.  +1 for the money mustaches.

            In fall of 2018, I read a blog post by Dan Luu called &quot;The googlebot monopoloy&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;googlebot-monopoly&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;googlebot-monopoly&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s a short blog post that I&#x27;ve probably read a thousand times at this point. He wrote about how websites give Google a big advantage when it comes to web crawling and how that big advantage probably makes it harder for other search engines to compete with Google. This was a pretty striking idea to me and there was a lot of talk at the time about antitrust and Big Tech. Dan&#x27;s post had been written in 2015, so I was sure that a ton of other people, especially DC policy people, already knew about this and were talking about it. Right?<p>Turns out, basically nobody in DC knew anything about this. A ton of website operators complain about it on their own forums like HN and SEO, it&#x27;s not hard to find people griping about the cost of Bing&#x27;s crawlers, but those people never saw fit to tell anybody in DC about this and how it impacts the market for general purpose search engines and gives Google such an advantage. So I started writing down everything that I was finding about Google&#x27;s web crawling advantage and writing it in a way that policy people could understand these things called web crawlers they had probably never heard much about before.<p>And, long story short, the policy people were very grateful that I had gotten in touch and explained all this, and I got cited in the Big Tech Antitrust report published by Congress last summer and then featured in The New York Times:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knuckleheads.club&#x2F;we-crawled-our-way-into-the-big-tech-antitrust-report&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knuckleheads.club&#x2F;we-crawled-our-way-into-the-big-te...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;technology&#x2F;how-google-dominates.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;technology&#x2F;how-google-dom...</a><p>So, Dan&#x27;s blog post has had a pretty big impact on my life so far and it&#x27;s not quite done yet. The pandemic has slowed me down this year much more than it did last year, but I&#x27;m working on preparing to submit a paper to an economics journal for peer review that lays out the dynamics of web crawling, why Google accrues this advantage and why it matters. I&#x27;m very grateful to Dan for writing that post and, as far as career advice goes, I heartily recommend going back every once in a while and rereading everything he has ever written. Who knows what else he&#x27;s hiding in there?

My natural inclination in these moments is to run. To get away, to be somewhere new, do something new, just get the eff away from wherever I am. I frequently felt that traveling and being a digital nomad would cure this problem and I would never feel that way, but the article above outlines why that isn&#x27;t the case. Our problems follow us everywhere, and just because I&#x27;m eating sushi in tokyo in some cool hole in the wall doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t dread and have anxiety.<p>I am very grateful for the traveling I&#x27;ve done, which is a fair bit more than a lot of Americans. But in addition to that blog post it has helped me realize it isn&#x27;t the cure to anything.<p>The article is sort of dumb and probably doesn&#x27;t resonate with everyone. But it helped me

            It does resonate with me. Having lived in Japan for a year I got a huge amount of benefit from it. I think the author dismisses too quickly the benefits of living and being exposed to a culture different from your own, as it acts as a new reference point for the rest of your life. If you&#x27;ve spent all your life in one country than living in another can really open up your mind in a genuine way. Not to mention learning a new language and being exposed to new things (like my love of karaoke and baths, not to mention tons of manga I never knew about)<p>And personally giving up my friends and living in a new environment forced me to adapt and become more social and less anxious. It had a huge positive effect on my confidence. I made friends different to the types of friends I had before. I did things I had never done before.<p>So yeah, if you end up reverting your &#x27;baseline&#x27; then it won&#x27;t help, and I can definitely understand that - I&#x27;ll never be an extrovert, I&#x27;ll always value having a few good friends and spending a lot of time alone - but that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be profoundly helpful for getting you out of a rut.

            Same here. It was an eye-opener for me.<p>This logic of alpha&#x2F;beta&#x2F;omega always seemed incomplete to me.<p>The Gervais principle seems to capture reality better, the losers are the ones that form groups where people can be categorized as alpha&#x2F;beta&#x2F;omega etc. and the clueless and sociopaths act completely outside of such groups. For the worse (clueless) or the better (sociopaths) of themselves.<p>Funny enough, lately alpha&#x2F;beta&#x2F;omega logic includes a &quot;sigma&quot;, which is the ham-fisted try to add sociopaths to their flawed system.

            The original NonZeroDay post [0] on Reddit. There are many variations of this productivity theme (Seinfeld etc) but the way this post is worded really hit me. I try and make progress on the book I&#x27;m writing every day - even if I just change one word, it&#x27;s a NonZeroDay.

            &quot;How I found &amp; fixed the root problem behind my depression and anxiety after 20+ years&quot; by Kaj Sotala.<p>It describes the concept of &#x27;self-concept&#x27; and a, I guess, pseudo-treatment for addressing deep-set neurosis&#x2F;anxiety caused by having one that is a little malformed. This post led (in a sort of roundabout way, hitting at a good time in my life and while I was already thinking in the direction of fixing this problem) to a sort of self-therapy where I snapped out of an unhealthy mental state I had been in for something like a decade. Probably good therapy could have had the same effect but I&#x27;ve always had trouble with that, and the ideas here led to a non-unsuccessful self-therapy. My issue was not at all related to the one he describes in the post, but the approach seemed to work anyway.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kajsotala.fi&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;how-i-found-fixed-the-root-problem-behind-my-depression-and-anxiety-after-20-years&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kajsotala.fi&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;how-i-found-fixed-the-root-prob...</a>

That farewell post, along with introducing me to the writings of Janna Malamud Smith (Private Matters: In Defense of the Personal Life), helped shape and define my perspective on privacy.

            I second both of these.  Even though they write a lot about tech, you can replace the specific technologies with the modern day equivalent and it&#x27;s still relevant.  For a lot of the topics, I haven&#x27;t come across anything else that better articulates it.<p>The next level is getting into the mind of Kathy Sierra.  The idea that helping people become passionate -- or badass, as she later rewords -- is an end in itself.  This isn&#x27;t just about tech.

Rather then dismiss fears over exponential tech he takes the claims seriously and tries to reason about them. He even factors anarcho-primitivism into his analysis which is as far away as you can get from Silicon Valley views which he obviously eptimomises being the founder of Sun Microsystems.<p>I love it as its a truly open minded attempt to consider the potential existensial risk of tech and the deep, big picture, philosophical implications of technological progress. It&#x27;s just so different to what most Silicon Valley luminaries talk about which are often full of certainty about our glorious future.<p>It resonates with me a lot as I often feel like a bit of an outsider as a technologist and software engineer who has the odd sleepless night about where it&#x27;s all heading. This quote haunts me...<p>&quot;I have always believed that making software more reliable, given its many uses, will make the world a safer and better place; if I were to come to believe the opposite, then I would be morally obligated to stop this work. I can now imagine such a day may come.&quot;<p>For me that day has not come but I feel that moral obligation more as I get older so I think I&#x27;m on the same page as Bill here.

            Life changing in that it changed my professional life. Steve Yegge&#x27;s piece that all programmers are typists, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;steve-yegge.blogspot.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;09&#x2F;programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;steve-yegge.blogspot.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;09&#x2F;programmings-dirties...</a>. It&#x27;s been a while since I read it but my recollection of it is that your tools matter and that you need to practice to get good in using your tools. Prior to reading this I was so focused on solving &quot;the problem&quot; that I never realized that I spent a lot of mental energy on the tools rather that was much better spent on solving whatever I worked on. This realization has changed how I approach technical stuff in my day-to-day job.

            A grain of salt is warranted. I also had Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and the interviewee said some pretty whacky things, maybe owing from the fact that he still has the disorder. He hasn&#x27;t actually figured it out.<p>NPD is a tool to protect yourself from mind-shattering degrees of shame. You latch onto something that makes you feel special, and you hold onto it for dear life. All of your decisions will stem from a desire to validate or protect that sense of being special. You&#x27;ll seek admiration to validate it, and you&#x27;ll seek to destroy critics to protect it. You might be capable of empathy, even great compassion, but you&#x27;ll remain utterly cruel and self-absorbed, because you&#x27;re a drowning man. You&#x27;re desperate, and you&#x27;ll see people as objects you can push underwater to get a gasp of air, and you&#x27;ll treat someone who snubs you as someone actively stepping on your head to drown you: your anger will know no bounds.<p>That&#x27;s what fragile narcissists actually are. They&#x27;re not wired differently; they&#x27;re drowning men.<p>If a narcissist is strongly motivated, and if they have a decade to devote to schema therapy for their underlying intense shame, then they can slowly morph into a normal prosocial human.<p>However, that doesn&#x27;t happen often, for a variety of reasons.

It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.
```<p>^ This is the crux of it, in familial (parental) relationships, we spend most of our time with them early in life, and that we don&#x27;t get nearly as much time with them after graduation.

            Might seem trivial, but this popular post about technical interview anxiety, &quot;Interviewing for the anxious programmer&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;zRFN3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;zRFN3</a><p>It was extremely comforting to me at a time where I was suffering from depression, and jobless -- struggling to obtain employment as a Software Engineer 2 years out of college.

It gave me some peace of mind knowing that I was not alone.<p>I still suffer from intense anxiety during technical interviews, but I no longer have an existential crisis about it or feel guilty for not being able to whiteboard well.

            This post on social mobility. It really made me think about where I came from and how different it is from my wife and why we are comfortable in different situations.<p>More specifically, the post explains the difference in Social Class and Working Class and how we often conflate those two things when in discussion. We often talk about “lower”, “middle” and “upper” classes, but the author proposes that those are actually Working Classes and not necessarily related to Social classes. We often migrate one or maybe two social classes higher or lower in our lifetime, but movements more than two rungs is prohibitively difficult.<p>It is an interesting way to look at society.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siderea.livejournal.com&#x2F;1260265.html?format=light&amp;fbclid=IwAR2fv67G9mR017huARy5Xi_J3ggeqLUapGTSWIe5flvdpEe4rESDKsmdSZc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siderea.livejournal.com&#x2F;1260265.html?format=light&amp;fb...</a>

            I don&#x27;t look back on it that fondly nowadays, but it would probably be Mr Money Mustache&#x27;s classic &quot;The Simple Math of Early Retirement&quot;. I am not on a path to FIRE really, but in my early twenties it was really incredibly eye-opening.<p>At that age, I had very much assumed that the world had to work according to &quot;work hard for 45 years, get the biggest house you can, buy as much stuff as you can, on your 65th birthday your company hands you a final salary pension that will last the rest of you life&quot;. Something had always felt a bit wrong about consumerism and the hedonic treadmill, but it took the brusque and entertaining prose of MMM to really stop and make me think.<p>Funnily enough, I now find him very grating, but he absolutely set me on a path of rethinking my life in my early 20s to truly think about what matters to me.

            Honestly I find the whole movement quite dreary if taken too seriously.<p>Of course, don&#x27;t spend on frivolous things.  Do you really need the designer bag, instead of just a bag?  Do you need that road-trip with your friends in your 20s?  Do you really need to impress that boy&#x2F;girl by taking them to a michelin restaurant for a date?<p>OTOH what is the opportunity, and life cost of being frugal or too frugal? Perhaps the designer bag caught the attention of the boss, and &#x27;earned&#x27; their respect, which ultimately translated to a promotion. Perhaps you ended up finding your life parrter in one of your road-trip friends.  Perhaps you didn&#x27;t get the boy&#x2F;girl because you cheaped out on the date.  Etc.<p>Life is to be lived.  Some moderation is required.  Not too much though.

            &gt; Honestly I find the whole movement quite dreary if taken too seriously.<p>FIRE content is best consumed in tiny doses. You can get 95% of what you need to know from a few blog posts, the Bogleheads Wiki, and creating a simple spreadsheet of your financial planning. That’s it.<p>The problem is that FIRE has become a magnet for people who are miserable and think retirement will solve all of their problems. This subset of FIRE people see their job as the source of all of their misery and have glorified the idea of FIRE as the only escape hatch. They think they’ll be finally be happy just as soon as they can save enough money (from the job they hate) and reduce their expenses (by ruthlessly cutting spending, even on things they enjoy) until the lines intercept on their FIRE projections.<p>There are many people following a FIRE path who don’t fit this stereotype, but those people aren’t the ones hanging out on FIRE forums discussing FIRE all day. The people who obsess over FIRE and want to create threads to trash talk their neighbors who had the audacity to go on an expensive vacation or write about how little they spent on food last year by eating lentils every day are predominantly the ones talking about it all the time. There just isn’t much to talk about once you’ve identified a retirement equilibrium target and established a plan, so most of the reasonable participants don’t bother hanging out in the FIRE communities.<p>There are exceptions to everything, of course, but I found that most real-world FIRE people I know don’t want anything to do with internet FIRE communities or MMM.<p>Finances are something that should enable the life you want, not something that should become the primary focus of your discussions, readings, and online discourse all of the time.

This subset of FIRE people see their job as the source of all of their misery and have glorified the idea of FIRE as the only escape hatch.<p>Frankly I&#x27;m amazed that there are people who don&#x27;t see their job as their primary source of misery. I mean, I can understand it on a logical level, I just can&#x27;t empathize. When I take time off I get up every day and actually get to decide for myself what I want to do with it and that&#x27;s amazing. Work doesn&#x27;t permit me that. Instead I have to prioritize away most of the things I want to do and squeeze the rest in between the 8+ hour chunks of my time I&#x27;m forced to sell. I derive no meaning from my work, it simply exists to sustain me. I&#x27;d get a job with fewer hours, even with the significantly lower pay, but because I live in the US that&#x27;s impossible if I also want to have decent healthcare.

            &gt; Wow, what a gloomy outlook. Have you really never, ever enjoyed your work or workplace? Your coworkers?<p>I enjoyed my part-time lab tutor job in college. I was paid $17&#x2F;hr for &lt;20hrs of work a week and largely just helped people understand their networking assignments when needed and otherwise did pretty much whatever the hell I wanted to do. The instructors who were my bosses were a lot of fun. I also got to help write curriculum and teach it to instructors at other schools, which is more fun than it sounds like.<p>Sadly, that job is not at all viable when one is no longer living with their parents and mooching off their healthcare.<p>I also liked the people I worked with at the school district enough to hang out with them after work, although we all did drink way <i>way</i> too much. The environment was terrible despite the people.<p>&gt; I suppose I’m in the opposite mindset: I’m amazed that there are people (in tech) who haven’t ever been able to find enjoyment in their work. We literally grew up to get paid to play on computers all day.<p>Yeah, I have to wonder about people like you whenever I see a horrifically slow website laden with megs of javascript that is broken half the time. I don&#x27;t get paid to &quot;play&quot; with computers at work, I get paid to keep infrastructure running and write programs that actually fulfill a business goal that isn&#x27;t &quot;farm users for ad revenue&quot;.<p>&gt; There are plenty of opportunities out there to have a good time in this field<p>You wouldn&#x27;t know it from reading the job ads. IT job ads make me want to kill myself.

            The problem I&#x27;ve always had with that story is that most people are struggling just to live on what they make. Saving 50% of your income when you are trying to make rent is a pipe dream. Even making decent money, if you have a family, saving is tough.

            &gt; The problem I&#x27;ve always had with that story is that most people are struggling just to live on what they make.<p>FIRE obviously isn’t meant for someone trying to live in an expensive city on a $15&#x2F;hr wage. However, there really are many career paths that readily allow the math. You’re obviously going to struggle to make it work if your goal is to work for a non-profit in Seattle or San Francisco, but it’s entirely within reach if you choose to work for an average tech company in an average city. It’s also trivial to make the math work out if you’re able to get a FAANG job anywhere and keep your lifestyle in check.<p>&gt; Saving 50% of your income when you are trying to make rent is a pipe dream.<p>Depends entirely on your lifestyle and relationship situation. Many of us easily achieved FIRE savings rates by simply getting married to another professional, choosing to keep expenses within the limits of one person’s income, and putting 100% of the other person’s income into savings. Instant 50% savings rate, and it’s not even difficult to be honest. As a bonus, it was easy to transition to having kids and a stay-at-home spouse because we already lived on one income.<p>Obviously doesn’t work for everyone in every situation, but it’s not correct to say it’s a pipe dream or that it can’t work. It’s a choice that requires choosing lifestyle and career directions to match, but everything is a tradeoff.

            &gt; The most important thing to note is that cutting your spending rate is much more powerful than increasing your income.<p>I believe that part isn&#x27;t exactly right, because you can increase your income way more than you can reduce what it takes for you to live. If you&#x27;re a software engineer making let&#x27;s say 70k, you can find a job where you make 150k, 200k or even more. If you currently spend 50k every year, it&#x27;s way more effective than trying to spend less. You also have to take into account that once you retire you can live somewhere where the cost of living is lower.

            Yes, doubling your income and maintaining your lifestyle would make a huge difference. In many cases such an extreme bump isn&#x27;t reasonably available.<p>I believe GP was more referring to the rough rule of thumb is to have 25x your annual expenses by the time you retire. +5k income versus -5k expenses, you&#x27;re better off cutting your expenses. By cutting expenses, the target drops by 25xExpensesCut, and you&#x27;re throwing an extra ExpensesCut towards savings, helping on both sides of the equation. Going from spending 95% of savings to 90% makes a <i>huge</i> difference on the timeline, but 50% to 45% is much more modest since the timeline for compounding growth is so much shorter.<p>Using 70k income, 50k expenses, and a 5% return, this would take about 30 years. [0]<p>75k income, 50k expenses goes to 25.2 years [1]<p>70k income, 45k expenses goes to 24 years [2]<p>150k income, 50k expenses goes to 10.6 years [3]<p>Another detail often forgotten about, salary is stated before taxes, spending is almost always after taxes.

            All good points. The original article has a few things that are oversimplified I think, which is why I criticize it a bit. For example, if you go from a country in the EU to San Francisco, you&#x27;re going to earn way more but spend way more too. But if you plan on going back to the EU when you retire, this won&#x27;t matter much because your living expenses will drop.<p>I don&#x27;t know how hard is doubling your income in general, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s always harder than dividing by two your expenses. The thing is that by focusing on earning more, you will end up with more money, and at that point you can always cut back expenses. While if you focus on cutting back expenses, you will end up with less money.

            Agree. I think that advice panders to people who want advice they can act on <i>today</i>. You can choose to save $3 at your next grocery store visit right away and it won’t even hurt.<p>However, telling people to work on earning more feels like an impossibly difficult ask for many. You’ll get instant pushback when you suggest it, so bloggers avoid it.<p>FIRE blogging is more about pandering to what people want to hear. It is, after all, a big money blogging niche these days. Alienating the reader is to be avoided if you want to keep readership up, so career and earnings are to be approached delicately if at all in their writings.

            That&#x27;s a good point. I wonder why we consider that people telling people to spend less is okay, while telling people to earn more is not. Maybe because we consider that they have total control over what they spend, but not over what they earn? While this may be true, most people still could probably find a better job.

            The other half of it is how much you spend. You also have to keep your retirement spending at the same level. i.e. if you make 100k&#x2F;yr and save 90% of it, you can retire in 3 years... <i>however</i>, you have to keep your spending at 10k&#x2F;yr. So if you can handle living that frugally, great! Otherwise you have to save a lot more before you can retire at your &quot;current&quot; lifestyle.

            But isn&#x27;t this just the financial equivalent of &quot;lose weight by consuming fewer calories than what you use&quot;? It&#x27;s far easier said than done.<p>If you lose your job, or spend a chunk of your savings in a family emergency of some kind, then what? Do you have to save 80% of your take home to make up for the lost savings?

            I’d say it was @paulg’s Beating the Averages. It led me to introduce a friend of mine to Zope, and to another friend (who introduced me to Zope years before). This led the first friend’s company to shift focus and become a key player in the CMS space with Plone (which is built on Zope), with many government portals and a large contribution to open source software. Along with the second friend they were instrumental in the creation of the Brazilian Python (Zope is written in Python) user association, of which I am also a founder. Without it, we wouldn’t have the yearly PythonBrasil conferences that introduce so many professionals to the language and foster a welcoming and inclusive community.<p>For me, personally, it was the third time I was smacked in the head with that qualitative productivity jump based on superior technology before I could articulate it in words. First was with Cincom’s Mantis, then Dataflex 2 (3 was crap), and then with Zope.

            Joel Spolsky&#x27;s The Perils of JavaSchools really popped my bubble when I first read it. It was part of a suggested reading list from the Software Engineering MA program I was taking (hidden away on a dark corner of a syllabus). Reading it felt like a refutation of almost everything I knew about software at that point. He introduced to me new topics I had never heard about from my compsci classes like Lisp and SICP.<p>Reading the post, it became clear to me that it was not about how quick or deep you can learn a language, but rather what are all the ideas and abstractions that enable such a language to exist. Computer science really was more than just computers. After reading that post I looked around and discovered the youtube videos of SICP, which have done more for my love and knowledge of programming than the entire MA program I took.<p>Link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;12&#x2F;29&#x2F;the-perils-of-javaschools-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;12&#x2F;29&#x2F;the-perils-of-java...</a>

            Nothing and no one is big enough to change your life. There are only several things that make small changes to your life, at different stages of your life, whether negative or positive changes, depending on how you cope with them. Add to this, what could be important for you, could be completely meaningless for someone else.

            I know Slate Star Codex already gets a lot of attention here, but Meditations on Moloch [1] helped me to stop being a libertarian. I was already well along the way of abandoning those politics, but that blog post, especially the arguments about multi-polar traps was the final nail in the coffin.<p>I think the past two years has provided even more evidence that simply letting people act however they want based on self-interest and relying on Nash for good outcomes can even be deadly.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;30&#x2F;meditations-on-moloch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;30&#x2F;meditations-on-moloch&#x2F;</a>

            Religion for the Nonreligious by waitbutwhy
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;religion-for-the-nonreligious.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;religion-for-the-nonreligious...</a><p>I was raised in a Christian family, as most Brazilians are, but was never really into it. I don&#x27;t remember praying after I grew up a bit (10+ years), and even before I was more saying the words than really meaning it.<p>Then my father passed away when I was 12 (he was in his 40s, died of cancer).<p>This led me on a few rabbit roles reading and talking about religion and the great questions of life. As I think many with a more analytical mindset, nothing really felt right, so I ended up being mostly atheist, with a few sparkles of buddhism and cristianity here and there.<p>Later in my 20s, I dated and later married an amazing woman who is a True Believer. She&#x27;s the daughter of a shaman with a buddhist monk, and has been meditating since she was born.<p>Many more conversations ensued. I explored some of the &quot;alternative&quot; religions, and enjoyed especially the animist ones (Earth, Sun and Moon are pretty close to gods in my mind). I also tried mushrooms, which were amazing on breaking my usual brain paths and allowing me to see from a different perspective.<p>But it still didn&#x27;t feel right. Again, I was trying to understand religions with an analytical mind, which can only get me so far. I felt I was missing on something big (I still do).<p>The world is too complex to be explained only with rationality and the scientific method, but at the same time explaining things based on dreams and our collective memory didn&#x27;t seem much better.<p>It was around this time I read the &quot;Religion for the Nonreligious&quot; article.<p>There were no giant breakthroughs, and the text is somewhat reductionist. Still, it was one of the first times I read about religion in a way that really clicked (other times were reading about some parts of buddhism and meditation).<p>One of the things that religion provides to people is structure. The world is too complex, and the nonsensical things happening every day can weigh someone down. Religious people can go on with their days knowing that there&#x27;s a bigger plan. I think this makes them more resilient to the life challenges that will appear, sooner or later (although this resiliency can disappear quickly, just see at the number of people that blame God after some disaster happen on their lives).<p>This text gave me some structure to think about where I am, where humanity is, and where I want to be. It made the world a little less chaotic, allowing me to see not only the little daily things, but also keep the bigger picture in mind.<p>It gave me some peace of mind and, after all these years since I first read it, I still think about it every week.
