            The most interesting new feature of LibreOffice 7.2 is the heads-up display, which can quickly search for any menu option. It resembles the command palette in Visual Studio Code.

            Microsoft pressured ISO to approve their format but NEVER implemented it according to the specification. In the meantime, many governments adopted MSO with the promise that compatibility would evetually be the norm. It never happened.<p>I don&#x27;t know if an anti-trust lawsuit is adequate, but governments should ban adoption of proprietary formats entirely.

            Microsoft produced the boondoggle &#x27;Office Open XML&#x27; formwat in reaction to the moves made by several large organisations to standardise on the Open Document format as used by OpenOffice et al. Microsoft reacted like they often did: they created their own &#x27;open&#x27; format, deceptively named &#x27;Office Open XML&#x27; to make it easy to confuse with the OpenOffice XML-based format and submitted it to standardisation bodies in the hope that one would bite. ISO - which already standardised the Open Document format - did, giving Microsoft a weapon to wield in any bidding war on which file format should be adopted as a standard.<p>I called OOXML a boondoggle because that what it was. Microsoft&#x27;s documentation of the format consisted of a several thousand pages long semi-binary dump of the files produced by Microsoft Office - which are not much more than memory dumps containing binary blobs, poured into an XML container with vague descriptions of what the data types actually were - often no more than &#x27;as produced by Microsoft Office version x.y&#x27;. A large portion of the original OOXML files consisted of blobs of binary MS Office data, making it close to impossible to implement that version by non-Microsoft entities. When pressured Microsoft agreed that the current versions of Microsoft Office were not producing &#x27;standard-compliant&#x27; OOXML but that this would change in newer versions. Well, the future came, the OOXML format was cleaned up and documented so as to be interoperable but Microsoft never adapted Microsoft Office to the standard, instead producing its own iteration of &#x27;the standard&#x27;.<p>In short, the only reason why they every produced OOXML - the &#x27;standard&#x27; - was to use it as a club to wield in negotiations. They never meant for it to be an actual data interchange standard, they never aimed at having third parties stand on a like footing with regard to which version of OOXML was meant to be canonical. It was, and still is, meant to be a box to tick on a compliance list for getting large contracts, not a file format standard to which their products would be tailored. Their vision is whatever is produced by the latest incarnation of Microsoft Office is &#x27;the standard&#x27;, just like before.<p>The real question to be answered here is why ISO went along with this charade when they already had a working file format standard in the Open Document format. They could just have said &#x27;no&#x27; like other standards bodies did, Microsoft could have been made to implement the ODF format and the world would be a better, more interoperable place.<p>So indeed, Microsoft should not be allowed to use a file format of their own design when implementing their own software <i>while selling it as if it abides by an ISO standard</i>.

            So your position is that any use of their own format is abusive in itself? The anticompetitive part of Microsoft Word is the bare fact that it exists? Under what circumstances would it be legal to use your own file format?

            The anticompetitive part is that MS Word has &gt;90% (?) market and forces its users into proprietary formats. Now, anyone who wants to use an alternative software will likely have to interact with the users of MS Word and will have to buy and install MS Word.

            &gt; 1&#x2F;10 documents created in Word would just look broken when opened in libre.<p>Versioning might play a role here. On Office I&#x27;ve often observed the tendency to use by default the latest format available, no matter if the poor guy on the other side will have to upgrade the suite to load it, therefore LibreOffice might come late since its developers for some time have to debug what Office already implements.
I now set up all LO installations i do for me and other people to output where possible (Word, Excel, Powerpoint) in Office 97-2003 formats, so they hardly give problems on Windows machines. Nobody complained so far, as it is extremely unlikely that those &quot;ancient&quot; but well oiled formats don&#x27;t support the features needed by 99.9% of users.

            Linux user, 100% LibreOffice, no choice &amp; no complaints. But it is funny how MS office just always seems to have the edge.<p>Honestly this is one of the areas where I think a government sponsorship program to encourage open formats and the tools to work with them would be good. MS Office is one of the great productivity tools of the 21st century. It is unbelievable how much has been done with it. But the document locking will be long term harmful.<p>LibreOffice is competing with a software leviathan here. There aren&#x27;t many beasts bigger than Office.

            If they had focused on true interop with Office a decade ago, then they&#x27;d have more traction (and credibility) here.<p>Back when Office was absurdly expensive, the need for a free&#x2F;Free option was pretty huge. I don&#x27;t see that need now -- I mean, I get that there are free-as-in-freedom types who will always choose LO over MS Office, and good on them for it, but that&#x27;s an uncommon position. In every collaborative business context I&#x27;ve ever been in, using something OTHER than true-blue MS Office was a recipe for sadness. This-or-that formatting wouldn&#x27;t work. Macros wouldn&#x27;t work. Templates and styles wouldn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s always been a nightmare.<p>We&#x27;d put up with it if there was literally no other way, but now that Office is both affordable and much, much more broadly available, I don&#x27;t see any reason to experiment with LO at all.

It makes an absolute hash of DOCX.<p>This is probably because most orgs that use Google Docs don&#x27;t care about DOCX compatibility. But the vast majority of offices use MS Office, so Docx compatibility is a big damn deal.<p>But! I will say that I absolutely HAVE heard many, many people reference the lack of docx compatibility as a reason NOT to use Google Docs -- or anything else that isn&#x27;t Office.<p>Even if we entertain your idea, though, and this isn&#x27;t really a reason people don&#x27;t use LO (even though it is), what then is the REAL reason people don&#x27;t use LO?
