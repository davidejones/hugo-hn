            This was about to become super inconvenient as I use my GV number for all online services, but just checked and was still able to receive 2FA notifications on GV App and Email so crisis is adverted for now.<p>Still a reminder that any Google services &amp; features I rely on could be axed at any minute. It&#x27;s been a couple of years that I&#x27;ve sworn off trying out any new Google Services. I used to look forward to their product releases, now I view them as a ticking liability where any time investments could be lost at their whims forcing you to scramble and find alternatives.

            There are lists of numbers owned by voip providers. If you have an early gv number it is usually not on those lists, and so it works fine. Whether that&#x27;s a good thing is another question.

            I use skype-in (skype with a landline number) that can do SMS.  The only site I have found that was able to send SMS to it was LinkedIn.  All the banks block it.  All eCommerce sites block it that I have tried.

            Ha! I work in the restaurant industry and I feel the same way, but about the pop up online ordering platforms and POS providers.<p>I had an argument (via email) with a POS provider whose time and attendance system were used by my client. I said I need SOH report (in NY you get special pay if you work more than 10 hrs in one day).<p>They said they donâ€™t have this report, but we could switch over to their payroll service, where they do offer this report.<p>Adolescent companies just wonâ€™t step out of their lane, even when they collect data which is necessary for compliance with the law.<p>Hmmm. Whatâ€™s going on? Young and impervious to reason. Old and careless.

            1. This only applies to forwarding. You still get all messages in the Google Voice apps.<p>2. My totally uniformed speculation is this has more to do with Google&#x27;s own numbers being flagged as spam by telecom carriers, rather than Google Voice not being able to detect spam itself.

            Can you confirm that this is indeed the case? I literally just ported my phone number back to google voice and gave my google fi a new number, because I found it annoying that hangouts stopped allowing me to call with googles recent changes.<p>What a timing on my decision.

            The spam note :<p>â€œImportant: In light of spam causing potential issues with SMS forwarding, text message forwarding to linked numbers will stop on or after August 1.&quot;<p>Only appears in the English version of the notes. I have not tested if it still works on non US Google accounts. Is there still something like US vs non US Google accounts?

            I&#x27;m not sure about others who still use this service, but I learned about this the hard way when I missed some important messages. I thought others should know, since it seems Google hasn&#x27;t issued any communication on this to customers.<p>EDIT: Seems they did send an email about 2 weeks before the change.

            I received an email about this from Google well over a month prior to the change. I have issues with this change (see my own comment), but they did send notices.<p>Whether or not they successfully got those emails to somewhere you saw them or not, and whether a month is enough notice for upending your SMS strategy are both good questions though, I suppose.

            We tried to use Twilio for 2FA and it was unreliable.<p>I canâ€™t find the page now, but Iâ€™m pretty sure at one point they had a page saying you shouldnâ€™t use it to receive 2FA codes. Itâ€™s very common for 2FA systems to blacklist numbers that are known to be used by providers like Twilio.<p>As far as I am aware, the only reliable way to receive 2FA over SMS is to have a real phone plan.<p>(Obviously SMS is a poor choice for 2FA in the first place, but sometimes thereâ€™s no other option.)

            It is precisely because Google Voice is a Google property that I, as an expat, have taken great effort to keep my US phone number with my US carrier.<p>Trusting Google with such an absolutely critical aspect of one&#x27;s life is lunacy.

            What did you choose? I used Google Fi for a while but it&#x27;s becoming gradually worse, so I&#x27;ve kept it mainly for the off chance that I need to go somewhere I can&#x27;t easily buy a sim card.

            I travel to Europe a lot - being originally from Italy - and they will have to grab my original 30$ per month contract from my cold dead hands. I get - slow - unlimited data when travelling and free SMSs, saved my bacon more than once.<p>I think they have something similar for 45$.

            This question was specifically targeted at the parent. People need a long term number when they&#x27;re overseas because otherwise their home services 2FA doesn&#x27;t work. People use GVoice or Google Fi because they need a US number. Ideally you don&#x27;t want to switch sim cards for that purpose. So I&#x27;m more interested in the US.

            Actually that is one of the use cases I use it for and nothing has changed. I get it through the app and over email. Not sure why an expat would have SMS forwarding anyways because I&#x27;m not sure they ever allowed forwarding to a non-US number in the first place (not sure about this though)

            So the really frustrating issue here is that there&#x27;s no functional replacement if Gmail is not your email provider: Google Voice completely ignores my email settings all over my Google account that send everything from Play receipts and Account notices to my actual email, and solely offers to send texts to my Gmail address which I haven&#x27;t used since 2016.<p>I get freaking Stadia ads in my real inbox just because I opened that website while logged into my Google account once, but Voice has no way to recognize the email address that every single other Google service is capable of sending email to.<p>Voice is no longer my primary phone number for obvious reasons if you know me at all, but basically it no longer has SMS support for me, so my last major use of a Google service will end if they do not fix it.
