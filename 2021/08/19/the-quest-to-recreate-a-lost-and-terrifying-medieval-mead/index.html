            &gt; To avoid the chlorine, fluoride, and other additives found in modern tap water<p>You should be able to get a water report from your municipality, listing any treatments they perform. Chlorine and similar can be removed with Campden tablets, available at your homebrew store. I&#x27;ve never heard of fluoride causing a change in a fermented product. I know plenty of breweries that just use fluoridated city water.<p>Note the special lid on that mason jar for allowing off-gassing. Fermenting in a mason jar with a standard lid is a recipe for exploding glass.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the fermentation time here. Meads are usually fermented longer, older recipes tend to have very short fermentation times. Especially older, low gravity recipes.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to play the guessing game on fermentation time, buy a hydrometer or refractometer.

Meads are usually fermented longer, older recipes tend to have very short fermentation times. Especially older, low gravity recipes.<p>The caramelization process does slow the process down a good bit. I&#x27;ve made a few bochets, and I notice they go slower than other meads.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of people having issues using Ale yeasts with meads. The temperature of the house could have an impact. The lack of available nutrients (raisins a hotly debated topic in the mead community).<p>I would expect the Kveik yeast, the Lalvin D47, and maybe the &quot;yeast party&quot; to be faster than the S-04 and Saison yeast.

            The choice of distilled water in particular for a historic recreation is very strange; water makes a big difference. Unless there&#x27;s reason to believe water in whatever part of France is very soft, a bottled spring water would have been a better choice if you don&#x27;t want to use tap.

            I find it curious that somebody so invested in recreating a medieval mead does not put in the extra effort of procuring long pepper and grains of paradise---those are certainly spices always present in my spice box.<p>I have never made mead myself however. Are the spices of so little consequence to the final flavour?

            &gt; I have never made mead myself however. Are the spices of so little consequence to the final flavour?<p>No, they do have an impact on the final flavor. I don&#x27;t know what long pepper or grains of paradise taste like, or what the yeast will do with the flavor compounds. In my experience, the quantity of spices in that volume will come through. I honestly feel like 20 cardamom pods will come through quite strongly, in my few years of experience of meads.

            I also found this curious. I don&#x27;t have either of those in my kitchen or at my grocery store, but they&#x27;re certainly available online.<p>They would be pretty noticable in the finished flavor, I imagine. Mead flavor is often best described as &quot;delicate&quot;, especially in lower abv meads. The carmellization and yeasts are  probably going to be the most notable flavors here.

            Not only that, but apparently it tends to boil &quot;volcano-style&quot;, and if you have ever burnt (or &quot;caramelized&quot;, to use the more elegant term) sugar, you know how sticky it is - now imagine a burning-hot drop of that sticking to your skin...

            Mead is not uncommon to find for purchase in some European countries till this day.<p>I cannot speak for how authentic is the modern day recipe compared to what the author found.

            There&#x27;s an online beer recipe calculator (Javascript required) that can also be used for mead:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brewersfriend.com&#x2F;homebrew&#x2F;recipe&#x2F;calculator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brewersfriend.com&#x2F;homebrew&#x2F;recipe&#x2F;calculator</a><p>It calculates based on volume of the combined ingredients. I assume dissolving 1 pint of honey in 9 pints of water will result in less than 10 pints of total volume. I don&#x27;t know exactly how much, but guessing 9.5 pints total, and using raw honey and raisins as the fermentables, I get 11% ABV with the high attenuation D47 yeast, and 8.7% with the low attenuation S-04.<p>Caramelization will reduce the fermentability of the honey, but I am not sure by how much. My guess is that it&#x27;s a small effect.

            (All this is wrong, go to edit) I would expect this mead to be high ABV, in the 12-13% range. 
The rule of thumb I&#x27;ve heard, and has been good in my experience is 1.035 SG per 1 lb honey per 1 gallon of water. The 3 lbs in 1 gallons would come out to a ~1.105 SG, which is a bit over 13%.
Though, the sugar content of honey varies from batch to batch, and the non ferment-able sugars from the caramelization process, I would expect anywhere from 9-12%. The more caramelization, the more &quot;burnt sugars&quot;, the less ABV.~<p>EDIT: I grossly miscalculated the weight oz to lbs. This is only 1.5 lbs, which would be ~5-6%, making it more akin the ABV of a beer. Same caveat that it would have probably been lower due to the unfermentable sugars.

            Which yeast you use could be very important too!: Different yeasts &quot;pack up shop&quot; during fermentation at different levels of ethanol. It&#x27;s their own waste-product, that humans love, that stops them, but some types of yeast can put up with much higher levels than others! (though there are other factors too like Ph&#x2F;pressure&#x2F;mineralisation&#x2F;etc).<p>Some yeast strains keep fermenting to (tolerate) a much higher ethanol percent than others, and the result of these more &#x27;vigorous&#x27; yeasts is generally a &#x27;dryer&#x27; result in brewing terms: A less &#x27;sweet&#x27; result because all the sugars have been &#x27;dried&#x27; out (ie roughly, consumed and converted to ethanol). This is not the only axis to think about here though! For mead to be &#x27;sweet&#x27; in the end it either has to use a yeast that gives-up (for that much sugar) and hope that nothing else can live in there (not a bad bet for partially-fermented-honey actually), or to be sweetened after-the-fact (probably more common in modern &#x27;Mead&#x27; products).<p>Fermentation involving a community of microorganisms (not just yeast) can often end up far dryer (especially given the time-frames they talk about in the article)! Many bugs can consume the &#x27;waste&#x27; products that each other makes, and this variety can create enzymatically-linked cascades of molecular conversion-in-phases that can result in all sorts of unexpected &quot;processing&quot; of the &quot;raw&quot; molecules in the brew, including the hops components (if beer) and I&#x27;d think all those spices in traditional mead-recipes were probably undergoing some transformations too! Fascinating!

            &gt; Instead of using honey I’d extracted and strained the modern way, however, I crushed some comb taken from a colony that had unfortunately not survived winter—the bees’ lasting legacy would be to provide honey close to what was available in the 14th century, including the occasional stray leg or wing.<p>Sounds like this stuff really is the <i>bee&#x27;s knees</i>.

            &gt; The first and only complete recipe for the drink—and the primary source for modern recreations—turns up in 1393, in what might be considered a manual of mansplaining.<p>Really? <i>Mansplaining</i> in the 14th century? Is that how historical subjects are going to be treated now?<p>&gt; An anonymous French writer penned an exhaustive guide to etiquette, moral conduct, and the practical concerns of a young bride, from choosing servants to throwing feasts: Le Ménagier de Paris (The Good Wife’s Guide). “It’s a ridiculous book,” says Verberg. “It’s micromanagement. I would not have wanted to be his wife.”<p>Nor would she (or he) have wanted you as her husband (or wife), she (he) would possibly not even have recognised you are a marriage-worthy candidate. Times change, attitudes change, mores and morals change, that is what makes history so interesting. Knee-jerk virtue signalling is not a sign of a good historian.<p>Read Machiavelli&#x27;s <i>The Prince</i> for another detailed manual on how to behave, in this case on how to become an effective prince. Was Machiavelli <i>mansplaining</i> as well, seeing as how he wrote the book to instruct another male?<p>Let history be history and study it for what it is, the past which eventually led to the present. Rest assured that once we are history many of our cultural traits will seem strange as well. Rest assured that what is considered virtuous now will be considered something totally different in a few centuries - if not a few decades.<p>Also, stop using labels like <i>mansplaining</i>, it adds nothing to the discourse and only leads to polarisation of the &#x27;<i>he is not in my camp</i>&#x27; type.

            I&#x27;ve read portions of that book, and the description is not inapt.  It&#x27;s a man of late middle age explaining to his young (14 iirc) wife _every painful feature of her duties_ in excruciating detail and with perfect self-concern, in a way that is  not typical of the way wives are addressed and marriage handled in other works I&#x27;ve read from the time.  I found it hard not to dislike the author intensely, which was not my reaction to other medieval writing at all.

            1393<p>If the new bride (14yo) can read such a book then she is not a peasant.  If the family owns a book then they are several tiers up again.  Anyone reading this book therefore has at least one servant.  If they do, that servant may well be a child even younger than the new bride (12yo).  Such a person definitely cannot read.  This is a book for the master or lady of a 14th century household speaking to their servant.  Mansplaining is expected.
