            Important to note to non Americans that this does not mean that 61% paid no taxes, it’s that they didn’t pay a specific type of tax (income at the federal level).<p>Individuals likely still paid Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, and potentially state and local taxes (which vary wildly). Most states also have sales taxes as well, and some local municipalities have surcharges as well.<p>And, lastly, we do have property taxes, which can be quite significant in large parts of the country. Even if you’re a renter, these costs are often indirectly passed on to you.<p>So, while federal income tax may have been less of a burden last year, there was likely still lots of taxes that each of these individuals paid.<p>Disclaimer: This post isn’t meant to be a statement of support or criticism of taxes. Just trying to highlight the many ways we pay taxes beyond federal income tax.

            To build off your details, many Americans also received a net payment back for federal taxes through the Earned Income Tax Credit (effectively a negative income tax).

            You’re correct but don’t take into consideration things like child tax credits.<p>I have family members that pay a total of $400 in tax yet receive a $9,000 or more “refund” due to various credits.<p>So yes, there is a sizable portion of the population that literally pays a negative tax rate even when factoring in all of the taxes you mentioned.

            This is probably because the top 10% earns almost half of income in America, the next 40% of America shares about 38% and the bottom HALF of Americans share less than 12% between them.<p>As far as wealth this bottom half also holds 2% of the net worth.<p>It should be unsurprising that people who have nothing aren&#x27;t paying much.

            Sure, but you’re ignoring just how progressive the US federal tax system is.<p>And in fact, many of the state income taxes are too.  A few states have flat taxes (but with healthy exemption), the other have brackets that steeply increase.

            &gt; You mean except for all the taxes other than income tax such that people making french fries often pay a bigger percentage of their incomes to taxes than billionaires?<p>That&#x27;s a false claim. The recent propaganda being pushed - eg by ProPublica - about billionaires supposedly paying low income taxes, of course, didn&#x27;t center on income taxes at all. It intentionally reframed the premise to be that billionaires weren&#x27;t paying enough taxes on their wealth (assets).<p>For example this article con line from ProPublica:<p>Headline: &quot;You May Be Paying a Higher Tax Rate Than a Billionaire&quot;<p>Summary: &quot;A new ProPublica analysis of a trove of IRS documents revealed that the richest 25 Americans pay a tiny fraction of their wealth in taxes.&quot;<p>So I might be paying higher taxes on my unsold stock holdings than Bezos is on his unsold stock holdings? Of course not. ProPublic is being intentionally deceptive.<p>The billionaires are paying a small share of their wealth in taxes every year. They pay high income taxes, when they generate high incomes. Wealth isn&#x27;t income. ProPublica knows that separation, they know how the tax system works, they spun the con regardless for propaganda points. ProPublica is trying to argue in favor of wealth confiscation policies, while lying and pretending they&#x27;re arguing in favor of the billionaires paying higher taxes akin to paying higher income taxes. The spin is remarkable for just how disingenuous it is.<p>Bezos isn&#x27;t paying enough income tax on his unsold Amazon stock holdings? Golly gee.

            The ProPublica article examined effective income tax rates. Not what you said. It even said they used the IRS definition of total income tax.[1]<p>Long term capital gains are taxed less than all but the lowest income brackets. Social Security tax is capped.

            Federal income tax is somewhat progressive.  All of the state taxes, last time I checked, are regressive.  For a while the least regressive was Oregon (which has a progressive income tax) and the most regressive was next door, Washington, which uses a sales&#x2F;use tax instead.

            This shouldn&#x27;t be surprising.<p>There have been millions of people on SNAP &amp; HUD &amp; Medicaid with no income for a long time. There&#x27;s just more programs and a lot more people now.<p>This time, however, it seems like these new programs are quite massive and are more &quot;want&quot; based than &quot;need&quot; based.<p>It&#x27;s quite obvious people with no income and kids &quot;need&quot; money. It&#x27;s less obvious to me that people who had kids for years, and still have their jobs, suddenly need $1k per month. I don&#x27;t think anyone would debate whether this $1k is improving their lives.

            Is social security and Medicare a “tax”?<p>Maybe Medicare since what you contribute is only partially linked to the benefit.<p>But social security is basically a public pension plan.  What you contribute determines your benefit.  You can even calculate the benefit yourself.  No different than a private pension plan.

            I think Medicare is clearly a tax, it can&#x27;t be an insurance program because there&#x27;s no connection between &#x27;premiums&#x27; and benefits.<p>Social security is nominally a government sponsored pension, but the payout ratios are weird, and it&#x27;s compulsory, so I feel it&#x27;s fair to call it a tax.<p>Same with at least the employee portion of compulsory unemployment insurance. Maybe that&#x27;s generally an actuaraily sound program (I think the employer contributions may be), but in times of economic stress, payments increase and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s covered by premiums. I know there&#x27;s a cap on benefits, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a cap on contributions? Anyway, seems similar to Medicare and I&#x27;d call it a tax, too.

            Although there is a &quot;social security trust fund,&quot; it&#x27;s an accounting fiction. Functionally the money you contribute goes to the general US treasury fund and payments to beneficiaries come from the general US treasury fund. It&#x27;s really just a pay as you go entitlement.

            Of those 61% that paid no taxes, I am willing to bet a vast majority of them will take more benefit out of Social Security and Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid than they ever put it. Even looking at the total tax burden the US and states barely take anything from the lowest two quintiles.

            Your numbers don&#x27;t seem right to me. For people who want more context than this comment provides, please start here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;historical-highlights-of-the-irs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;historical-highlights-of-the-ir...</a><p>Some highlights:<p>&gt; 1862 - President Lincoln signed into law a revenue-raising measure to help pay for Civil War expenses. The measure created a Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the nation&#x27;s first income tax. It levied a 3 percent tax on incomes between $600 and $10,000 and a 5 percent tax on incomes of more than $10,000.<p>&gt; 1909 - President Taft recommended Congress propose a constitutional amendment that would give the government the power to tax incomes without apportioning the burden among the states in line with population. Congress also levied a 1 percent tax on net corporate incomes of more than $5,000.<p>&gt; 1913 - As the threat of war loomed, Wyoming became the 36th and last state needed to ratify the 16th Amendment. The amendment stated, &quot;Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.&quot; Later, Congress adopted a 1 percent tax on net personal income of more than $3,000 with a surtax of 6 percent on incomes of more than $500,000. It also repealed the 1909 corporate income tax. The first Form 1040 was introduced.<p>&gt; 1918 - The Revenue Act of 1918 raised even greater sums for the World War I effort. It codified all existing tax laws and imposed a progressive income-tax rate structure of up to 77 percent.<p>Also something many people don&#x27;t realize is that in the &#x27;50s the highest marginal tax rate was 91%, for $4M or more. (The lowest was 20% for $40K or less.) So I don&#x27;t totally see how your comment relates to the article. You can draw diverse conclusions looking backwards.

            While I appreciate your perspective, you seem to have cherry-picked a particular instantiation of the income tax to make a point, which I think dovetails with the last sentence in my original post. You can draw lots of conclusions by looking backwards.

            If you break down what the US gov spends money on it is absolutely not those things. The US is mostly in the business of insurance (welfare, healthcare) and &quot;education&quot;.

            This isn&#x27;t accurate if you are talking about the federal level.  A better model in terms of spending is that the federal government is an insurance company with an army.<p>The federal government spends something like 10 times as much on defense as direct educational expenditures and it&#x27;s still significantly more than education if you include things like loan financing in education.

            Given that education funding is done by the states, that&#x27;s like saying the Federal government spends 10 times as much on welfare as on police and firefighting.<p>I mean, OK, but that&#x27;s only because the second part of your comparison isn&#x27;t a federal government responsibility and there are only certain targeted initiatives (mostly pork-barrel) that fall into that category. Same for federal spending on education.<p>But when you look at <i>all</i> government spending on education, it&#x27;s very clear that we spend more on education (5% of GDP, not counting loan guarantees) than on defense (3.7% of GDP). Except education is funded by local government whereas defense is funded by the federal government.

            Not sure that&#x27;s all that meaningful though? I mean, the inflation rate is effectively an average of the increase in costs across a variety of goods. Either that average is non-representative of the actual increase in costs (so meaningless), or that average is representative, but still an average, in which case you would still expect outliers, both above and below the average inflation rate.<p>You would need the second derivative to be meaningful (and maybe that&#x27;s what you mean), the percentage increase compared to the percentage increase in inflation (i.e., if in one year inflation is 2% and healthcare costs increase 4%, and the next year inflation is 2%, and healthcare costs are &gt; 4%, and this trend continues, that would be concerning)

            It serves as a cautionary tale. Just keep in mind that whenever some politician proposes a tax only on the richest Americans, and that tax is very very small, it won&#x27;t stay that way.<p>The highest rate in 1913 was 7%. Today the lowest rate is 10%.

            I didn&#x27;t include the 1944 rates because I only wanted to mention the top rate at the time of the adoption&#x2F;passage of the 16th amendment and the income tax. My point was, at the time, the public was told the rates would be low and only on top earners. Then overtime, the rates rose while the brackets kept expanding downwards to include more and more of the middle and lower class. My point was not &#x27;taxes never go down&#x27; but rather, taxes expand to include more and more people, despite originally being told they would not.

            My point was not to refute that taxes went up, but rather that they didn&#x27;t go up in a vacuum.<p>Wars were financed, population and productivity increased by huge amounts, and the entire economy shifted from an agrarian to an industrial one.   The country&#x27;s massive physical, social and and human infrastructure was built, one that the current high standard of living is still largely dependent on.<p>It is highly motivated reasoning to only highlight the tax rate increases without the sweeping societal changes that accompanied them.

            Reminder that the bottom 50% of the population by income pays 3% of federal tax receipts. Collecting tax from them is theater designed to make taxation seem more fair, but after frictional costs of collection + deadweight losses are accounted for this is likely net negative.

            I got downvoted last time I said this, but with fiat money there is no reason for anyone to pay income taxes. Obviously there is no correlation between income tax revenue and government spending. They just create the money they need, the never-to-be-paid-off deficit grows, the value of the dollar shrinks, and we move on.<p>Taxes serve as a means of coercing the behavior of the citizens, in the sense that certain things are rewarded with tax deductions or credits, and other things are punitively taxed. That is the reason they still exist.<p>We should just do away with taxes. People&#x27;s work and business activity, conducted in terms of US dollars, creates value. The government takes some of that value by simply creating more dollars. Why do we need a huge, complicated taxing bureaucracy in the middle of it?

            If there was no taxation, there would be no &quot;compelling&quot; reason for anyone to keep using the currency (which would be also losing value directly by the increase in money supply from government spending).
In other words, even under MMT taxation is necessary to limit inflation.

            This actually expands further than taxes and expands to all government services. Water bill, inspections, sewer. Those institutions will always only accept dollars, and that backstops the value.<p>Thought experiment: rampant inflation happens and the dollar inflates 10x. My $1M house is now worth $10M. It&#x27;s reassessed (because I don&#x27;t live in California) and now my tax bill is suddenly $100,000 &#x2F; year instead of $10,000! I need to acquire $100,000 or I go to jail. So I start selling assets into dollars. This deflates the dollar. Everyone does this simultaneously and the dollar goes back to its natural value.

            Taxes are hugely complicated because they are trying to do two different things at the same time: combat inflation and enact policy.<p>If we just printed dollars to pay for all gov expenses, we would probably have a lot of inflation. Inflation hits all holders of dollars equally (on a percentage basis). Taxes allow us to spread the burden of shared costs (like infrastructure) in a different way.<p>Additionally, taxes act as a feedback mechanism on behavior. We can incentivize some things by giving tax credits for doing them, and we can disincentivize other things by charging higher taxes on them.<p>Balancing these two effects of taxes: inflation and policy, is hard. If the gov. wants to encourage everyone to buy an electric vehicle, we could give a big tax incentive to do so, but that reduces overall taxes, which means more inflation. To combat this, we have to print fewer new dollars or increase taxes somewhere else.<p>This is one of the big challenges for the Federal Reserve, they don&#x27;t get to pick how much tax is collected, just how many new dollars are printed. If congress doesn&#x27;t collect enough tax, there&#x27;s only so much the Fed can do to balance things.

            Under Modern Monetary Theory, it doesn&#x27;t sit on the tax money, it burns it. The money just disappears into a black hole.<p>And it can invent money from the same black hole, but they don&#x27;t have to balance. The money spent and money taken in are completely independent. That&#x27;s the joy of running your own currency.<p>The downside of running your own currency is that it will inflate. So you have to take some out of the system. Which you can do in any number of ways, but the most obvious is taxation: you take money and burn it. Not the physical notes, obviously, but rather the line in an account book somewhere.<p>We&#x27;ve actually been doing something a lot like that for a long time. The US government hasn&#x27;t had balanced books in forever, and consumer inflation during most of that time has been low. It may be doing messed up stuff to the asset markets and may be reaching its limits, but MMT prescribes a smooth slowing of the market rather than a crash.<p>Some economists suggest just doing away with the fig leaf and stop trying to balance the budget, but rather just keep an eye on inflation and set policy (both tax and spend) accordingly. That&#x27;s considered a fringe movement at the moment, but even mainstream economists will say that it&#x27;s not as far removed from reality as you&#x27;d expect from a comparison to a non-currency-making entity like a person or business.

            No it&#x27;s not a thesis, it&#x27;s how modern government (and accounting) works.<p>Back in the day when money was a hard asset that could not be easily created (copper, silver, gold), you paid your coin dues to the regional king, and in turn he paid for security&#x2F;services over the land. That was taxation.<p>We eventually stored our precious metal in banks, and traded paper coupons representing those metals. We formed governments, who decided one day to revoke the ability for people to redeem their paper coupons for their gold. Now we still had to pay taxes with paper money, but it was no longer attached to gold&#x27;s value.<p>The government&#x2F;central bank now had the ability to create money at will, and does not physically need to rely on tax dollars coming in: it can create the money, pay for services, and collect taxes later. If it spends more than it collects, it has a deficit. This deficit can be funded by creating new money (in turn devaluing it, aka inflation), or by borrowing money that already exists (raising money through bonds).<p>So every year, when you wire your tax money to the government, bits of data are simply written to a database, indicating money removed from your account. There is no physical transfer of assets to the government; remember, the money that was paper is now digital. Money is numbers in a database.<p>Management of money at the macro level is now just balancing accounting inflows and outflows, surplus and deficit. Debt can be infinitely be paid off (create more money) at the consequence of devaluation of course.

            People would move their income streams into non-$ denominations, keep their bank accounts in foreign currencies and so on to avoid the inflationary effect.<p>Further, it would be a regressive tax, not even flat, in practice: poor people are more reliant on cash and short term income which can&#x27;t be diverted to a different currency. And even if high income people couldn&#x27;t switch currency, flat taxes are already regressive on a marginal utility basis. Every extra dollar of income or wealth has less utility, because you no longer need to cover essentials like shelter and food, but are spending on entertainment, higher and higher quality, or Veblen goods, etc.

            Printing the money would create uncertainty - how much will the government print? How much will inflation be? How will the dollar fluctuate against currencies of trading partners? Uncertainty kills business and this plan would hurt every aspect of trade and manufacturing.

            The Fed has a 2% inflation target (used to be their only stated target, now they balance unemployment in their target numbers as well). This allows companies to plan ahead knowing with a fair degree of accuracy the expected change in purchasing power year to year.

            No, not at all. How much will they print? 23% of GDP? 18% of GDP? That’s $1T difference in cash. How will that affect inflation? Who knows, no one can predict that. A shrinking dollar is bad for imports and America has a huge trade deficit right now, it would cripple international trade.

            You just need to account for jurisdictional apportionment. Only the fed can print money. How does that get allocated? Sales tax and property taxes, which presumably would continue to exist in under this scheme, would do some I suppose. Would there still be jurisdictional income taxes?

            Taxes create civilization and they power most of the things we love about society... roads, infrastructure, retirement, keeping the environment protected, keeping food safe, keeping restaurants from giving us all rat poop, etc etc... the list is very long. I never understood people who don&#x27;t like taxes. I totally get not liking how much they are or where the spending is going, but they literally are civilization.<p>To your 2nd point, money is psychological, that model might happen one day but right now that is not something lenders can get behind. Although you could argue MMT and the current system is headed that way. Taxes are also psychological to help you feel like you are part of the system, and not outside of it.

            I don&#x27;t think you read his post very closely. His first point was that the government has the ability to print money to pay for what it needs which is effectively &quot;taxing&quot; everyone equally across the board (which we feel as inflation).

The states did some (less than they alone, ignoring the feds, do now), the US did a little (<i>far</i> less than now, and funded by extensive use of simultaneously regressive and contractionary tariffs and excise taxes) at normal times and when it scaled up imposed special taxes for the purpose (including, starting in the Civil War, income taxes.) For the military part specifically, prior to WWI (and, to—IIRC—a lesser extent between WWI and WWII), the US had (especially aside from the Navy) very little standing military, relying on expanding out from a small cadre via conscription and rushed training in crises.

            The low inflation in the US before income taxes were introduced falsifies the argument, no? No other currency was widespread in the US prior to income taxes. I still don&#x27;t actually understand the argument, to be frank.

            Well, I agree that the combination of printing money with no taxation isn&#x27;t going to work due to inflation.<p>I just didn&#x27;t understand the statement that a currency&#x27;s value &quot;derives largely from the ability to pay [income] taxes with them&quot;. That statement by itself is historically false, as the gold-backed currency shows. It still makes no sense to me even <i>without</i> gold-backing. As long as the money supply is kept relatively stable, all you need is for a few government services to operate exclusively in USD (e.g. welfare, where funds are raised via land tax or carbon tax for example), and for a reasonable amount of trust in the government, and to perhaps kickstart the group delusion of trust with initial gold-backing, and you&#x27;re all set. I <i>can</i> make sense of the statement strictly in the context of money printing, where you need the offsetting deflationary impact from taxation (not necessarily <i>income</i> taxation), but that meaning wasn&#x27;t so clear from the original statement that I was responding to.

            Government debt; so long as that exists then the value of the currency will be derived from the ability to fund that debt through raising revenue - i.e. taxation. Without governement debt, different story.

            This is a shit take. Please refrain from commenting on things you are clueless about. I don&#x27;t have time to explain macroeconomics to you, although I&#x27;d encourage you to study yourself. Suffice to say the government can not, and does not pay for itself by endlessly expanding the money supply. That is one tool it has, but if overused causes severe inflationary problems. One of the US&#x27;s biggest strengths is the reliability of its currency to inflate at 2-3% a year.

            The point of income tax isn&#x27;t revenue - that comes from printing money, or from corporate taxes.<p>Income tax is basically a surveillance tool - it forces you to declare all your income sources, and a large part of spending (if you want to claim some tax breaks).

            Meanwhile, I still haven&#x27;t gotten my tax refund for 2020.  Mind you, I am in no hurry, it isn&#x27;t like I am desperate for that amount.  Aside from a very slight anxiety that my paperwork (and it <i>was</i> paper) got lost, getting last year&#x27;s refund in the month of December (yes, the last one of the year) was an interesting if small indicator of just how poorly the federal government was doing at the time.

            This article is doing some really funny accounting. Like I get it but it&#x27;s also conflating two things that most people probably don&#x27;t.<p>The headline should be: 61% of Americans have a federal income  tax burden which is less than $1800 and so with the federal stimulus program they are net positive from Uncle Sam (kinda, assuming you only pay income tax and nothing else).

            Because you get a refund for taxes paid which you didn’t owe. You pay an estimate over the course of the year based on how much your employer thinks you’ll make, then they (the IRS) refund you the difference if you make too little, or have sufficient deductions to further lower your tax bill.

            At least two ways:<p>1. Refunds if you were overtaxed during the year. For instance, someone making $100k&#x2F;year but was laid off in March or April when COVID closures started hitting may have had a large amount withheld that was refunded if they remained unemployed the rest of the year.<p>2. Your income is sufficiently low. If your income is below a certain threshold (or you just claim a lot of credits on your W-4) then nothing will be withheld. Common with minimum wage part-time jobs.

            Part of the article&#x27;s <i>point</i> was that so fewer people even <i>got paychecks</i> in 2020. That, and pandemic relief in the form of <i>tax credits</i>, which reduced people&#x27;s tax liability.<p>But also keep in mind: not everyone who has income gets it from a paycheck; plenty of self-employed or small business people don&#x27;t get paychecks; when they&#x27;re paid, it&#x27;s up to them to put money aside all year to pay taxes at tax time.

            They&#x27;re only regressive if you&#x27;re not considering what people are getting out of their taxes. Gas taxes pay for highways. Social security taxes pay for your retirement. The US has one of the most progressive tax systems in the world. The only benefit we seem to get out of it is that the poor and middle class end up spending more money on consumer goods.<p>In the US, property taxes are so low such that they are uncorrelated with rent. The properties with the lowest tax rates thanks to Prop 13 also have some of the highest rents.

            Payroll taxes and sales taxes are regressive. Taxes on income earned from possessing wealth are vastly lower than taxes on income from doing work.

            &quot;A just tax would be a consumption tax.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t want a just tax I want a tax system that is effective. When vast amounts of wealth continually become concentrated in the hands of a tiny amount of people, the only effective tax regime is one that extracts wealth from <i>the people who have all the wealth</i>.

            No, that&#x27;s not really fair. Someone poor might spend all their income on consumption to stay alive. Someone rich is going to save a lot of their income. Effective tax rates would be higher the poorer you are.

            Children are taxed through their parents much as renters pay the property taxes of property owners. The difference is that <i>children are taxed without representation</i> since the vote is withheld from them and their stewards.

            Nobody is saying that. Income tax is progressive -- some say not progressive enough but still progressive. Sales tax is regressive.<p>Saying &quot;half of all Americans don&#x27;t pay taxes&quot; is just wrong. The statement is &quot;half of Americans don&#x27;t owe any federal income tax&quot;. We all pay different taxes like sales tax, property tax (either directly or via rent), payroll tax, capital gains tax, state taxes, local taxes, etc, etc.

            This is a big reason we have two Americas. It&#x27;s well past time to ditch this, and just move to a consumption based tax everywhere. The current system is just a tool for the parties to target money at their own constinuencies, and is almost impossible to manage or stay compliant with. The poor don&#x27;t pay it a all while the hyper rich can afford the tricks and lawyers to not pay it.<p>The only ones who pay income tax are the middle class and the lower upper class (IE, not the 1%).
