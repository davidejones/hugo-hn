            The most awful format ever; A chain of tweets interspersed with memes. This should be a blog post, but I guess that&#x27;s too 1999 for the author.<p>So why do foxes lead you to treasure? Answer: They pathfind away from player not by euclidian &quot;distance&quot;, but simply by number of navmesh polygons. The game world has uneven navmesh density, with points of interest (locations often housing treasure) having a higher number of polygons, so the foxes tend to pathfind their escape path into them.

            No idea why you are so condescending. Maybe he doesn&#x27;t have a blog and he&#x27;s just using the platform where his following is.<p>Fwiw, I prefer chain of tweets like this to blog posts. It forces the author to compress as much information as possible into every paragraph and split up their thoughts.

            To each their own, but I feel like the discoverability of the &#x27;whole story&#x27; seriously suffers. Any time I try to follow a Twitter thread I can usually find 2&#x2F;3 of the posts pretty easily while the rest tend to be buried somewhere in the memes and pointless banter.<p>A blog post can be equally &quot;to the point&quot; as a Twitter post, your SEO might suffer but I&#x27;d imagine 99% of bloggers really don&#x27;t care. And FWIW, anyone can setup a WordPress in just a few minutes assuming you use a *.wordpress.com, to name just one of many free blogging platforms.

            That&#x27;s funny. I find HN far more annoying because of conversations like this. Instead of having good technical conversations it&#x27;s almost always people critiquing things like the font that someone&#x27;s using on their site, and for some insane reason it&#x27;s voted up to the top. And here I am contributing to the problem by extending this stupid thread further.<p>I had to scroll down ~75% of this page, passing what seemed like many dozens of posts all saying the same useless shit about the format and not talking at all about the content.<p>And that got me to the next top post, which... is someone just unrolling it.<p>Thankfully, soon after, someone asks a legitimate question about <i>the content</i>. Nearly at the bottom.<p>The twitter thread on the other hand is concise and easy to scroll through. A couple of memes because someone&#x27;s having fun telling <i>their story</i> seems relatively benign compared to the average HN comments section drivel.

            Yeah, and normally I don&#x27;t bother commenting, I just downvote and move on, but given that the comments section was already (in my mind) a disaster and the irony of the parent post I made an exception.

            Side note: I used to think I was down voting when I was collapsing the thread and I felt REALLY bad for doing it.<p>Note to Newbs: you can&#x27;t dont vote until you hit 500 &quot;points&quot;, and then an upside down arrow appears underneath the &quot;up vote&quot; arrow.

            I wonder if HN should offer two sections: Opinion and Insight. 
You decide where to post, but others can disagree through reports.
If someone answers a question with an insightful comment, the thread is moved over.

            As far as I can tell, HN isn&#x27;t designed or intended for &quot;good technical conversations&quot;, nor &quot;on-topic conversations&quot;. It&#x27;s intended for &quot;interesting conversations in general&quot; (or some variant) based on the guidelines, behavior of the moderator(s?), and content.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily <i>like</i> this kind of bent, but that&#x27;s the way that it is.

            Yeah, but that is where their friends, followers, audience, comfort is.<p>Its like saying &#x27;I wish he hadn&#x27;t told they story down the pub, the pub is a terrible place to tell stories as it is too noisy and I find it hard to follow with everything else going on&#x27;.

It was designed to be a bad medium for telling stories, so chaining a dozen tweets is a frustrating experience for both the author and the reader.<p>It&#x27;s obvious why people still insist on using Twitter for telling stories: Twitter is a massively popular website, and the author will lose some percentage of readership if they link to an external blog. Ideally, Twitter would recognize that this is now a major use case and would add UI to support long-form communication. In the meantime, it&#x27;d be nice if people shared Twitter chains via threadreaderapp or authors used screenshots of the Notes app. Using a medium designed for telling stories would be even better.

            Screenshots of text are inaccessible to assistive technologies without alt text. Twitter&#x27;s alt text limit is 1000 characters.<p>But, again, if you&#x27;re also annoyed that social story telling IRL happens with interruptions and digressions and background noise (and perhaps even four to six drinks!) then you are really asking for something other than what it is.

Yes, interruptions happen IRL, but they aren&#x27;t systematically happening every other sentence. Also, you can use body language or talk louder to ensure you&#x27;re understood IRL. Internet communication doesn&#x27;t have the same luxury.<p>Disruption while consuming information in the browser is a different animal compared to person-to-person contact.

            Because social media site algorithms feed on &quot;engagement&quot;, people interacting with your content rewards you in the form of your content becoming more visible to others, which results in more engagement, which spreads it further, etc etc etc. This is how something &quot;goes viral&quot;.<p>Sending people away from your content on the social media site to view it somewhere else results in less interactions with the social media content -- there&#x27;s not 20 tweets all of which can be replied to, liked, retweeted, etc, there&#x27;s just one tweet (and a blog post that the social media site can&#x27;t see).<p>Thus, giving people less things to interact with means that you&#x27;ll receive less rewards.

            I told you how. Maybe you&#x27;re being too literal?<p>It&#x27;s &quot;punished&quot; in the sense that there&#x27;s a relative negative consequence -- your post is raised up less by the algorithm than competing posts. This is colloquially valid.

            The pub is a great place to tell stories though, so your analogy is an appropriate action in an appropriate place. This is like staging a play at a pub - great gimmick once in a while, certainly not a bad thing, but it just isn&#x27;t practical to do a full stage production at an average pub. The lighting isn&#x27;t there, the stage isn&#x27;t big enough and the patrons are busy eating and drinking. It would be better to go to a theatre.<p>Similarly, this fellow is telling an interesting anecdote. But what we see here is a man searching for a paragraph while living in the desert of a sentence.

            Sure, but would you actually create a new blog just to tell a story? I would feel pretentious, like my story is so good that I need to create a new blog for it. No, I would just use what&#x27;s available to me.

            I think this is hitting it. I do have ad-blockers extensions on, so that could be what&#x27;s helping in this case. Also other people pointed out that it sucks on mobile (which I can confirm is an issue).<p>Was just curious since I (weirdly) only ever look at twitter in a browser

            If you can make an infinite tweet chain then compressing information cannot be an argument since it isn&#x27;t something necessary. And if you cannot, you may potentially be unable to provide all the information you want or worse needed for the topic at hand. In any case a blog post isn&#x27;t required to be big in size with very condensed text.

            You just complained about GP not liking something, insisted it was cool and fun just because <i>you</i> thought so, man the irony is astounding.<p>GP&#x27;s comment was fun and cool, every time someone posts something like this, you have to come in and throw your 2 cents in. We all know how you feel about it by now, if you hate it that much don&#x27;t click on the HN comments. just let it be!<p>Even if it had been in a blog, if it was interrupted with memes and meanders,it would be a bad article.<p>I&#x27;m glad you enjoyed it, GP&#x27;s comment should have nothing to do with whether <i>you</i> liked the article or not.<p>Twitter is garbage, its format is garbage. I certainly appreciate GP cutting through the cruft.

            Holy shit, do you think developers are the only people who deserve to consume information?<p>Yes, he could have told the story in one paragraph. Would it be as entertaining? Debatable.

            Not GP, but the point was that what he wrote should be an article&#x2F;blog post instead of in a chain of tweets. It&#x27;s not about the length or conciseness at all.<p>That they also summarized it in one paragraph for the audience here on hn is separate from that point<p>My opinion is, that the author, the one putting the work in decides the format and platform to use, but people are also free to dislike the format.

            Sorry, maybe I rage-read-into GP&#x27;s comment too much. I interpreted it as &quot;this is a garbage format, here&#x27;s a paragraph that would&#x27;ve sufficed&quot;.<p>What I&#x27;m arguing is that adding pictures&#x2F;memes&#x2F;space&#x2F;cadence to information can be helpful to readers who aren&#x27;t familiar with the subject area.

            That bar for readability is extremely low though. 260 characters at a time with pictures in between is basically a children’s picture book. I don’t think the GP’s comment is being unreasonable.

            GP did a good job summarizing the explanation, but there were a lot more details and at least one useful photo in the twitter thread. Transcribed and lightly condensed below for the convenience of others:<p><i>&gt; Among Skyrim players, you&#x27;ll occasionally see this tip: if you see a wild fox, follow it and you&#x27;ll be led to treasure. Sometime shortly after shipping, we saw this going around online, and an informal investigation started.  Who made foxes do this?!</i><p><i>&gt; Skyrim uses something called &#x27;navmesh&#x27; for AI navigation. For non-dev folks, this is an invisible 3D sheet of polygons that is laid over the world, telling AI where it can and cannot go. </i><p><i>&gt; In most situations, you&#x27;re seeing AI decide what do to (run at player, hide in cover, etc), use navmesh to make a path, and navigate along that path. Foxes are no different.  But their AI is very simplified: they basically can only run away. </i><p><i>&gt; So foxes flee.  Why would they flee towards treasure? This is where it gets interesting. If you&#x27;re close to an AI, it&#x27;s in &quot;High Process&quot;, or the most fancy, cpu-intensive pathfinding.  It uses the full navmesh and will do things like line of sight and distance checks. </i><p><i>&gt; To contrast, there&#x27;s also &quot;Low Process&quot; - used for stuff like NPCs walking a trade route across the world. These are only updated every several minutes, and position is tracked very loosely.</i><p><i>&gt; There is a sort of &quot;Medium Process&quot; for characters nearby, but who didn&#x27;t need the complex pathing of combat. Because of the way the fox&#x27;s AI worked (always be fleeing!) it&#x27;s basically ONLY using this process. </i><p><i>&gt; This is where understanding of how Skyrim uses navmesh comes in. Swaths of the outdoor world have simple navmesh.  You don&#x27;t need to add lots of detail in a space with basic topography, little clutter, or a low chance of combat. So wilderness = small number of big triangles. </i><p><i>&gt; When you stumble across something like a camp, however, navmesh gets way more detailed.  Added visual detail means added navmesh detail, and if we&#x27;re placing NPCs of any kind, we also tend to add even more detail. So Points of Interest = big number of small triangles. </i><p><i>&gt; You see where this is going? The Fox isn&#x27;t trying to get 100 meters away - it&#x27;s trying to get 100 triangles away. You know where it&#x27;s easy to find 100 triangles?  The camps&#x2F;ruins&#x2F;etc that we littered the world with, and filled with treasure to reward your exploration. </i><p><i>&gt; So foxes aren&#x27;t leading you to treasure - but the way they behave is leading them to areas that tend to HAVE treasure, because POIs w&#x2F;loot have other attributes (lots of small navmesh triangles) that the foxes ARE pursuing. </i><p><i>&gt; It&#x27;s a nerdy little story, but I love it. Emergent Gameplay is often used to describe designed randomness, but this is a case of actual gameplay that NOBODY designed emerging from the bubbling cauldron of overlapping systems. And I think that&#x27;s beautiful. </i>

            That&#x27;s kind of implied by the explanation itself though. Ie the explanation is not &quot;Jimmy added this easter egg&quot;. It&#x27;s something technical. Which implies it was not designed.

But, if you already know a little bit about nav meshes, he could have explained what happened in a lot fewer tweets.<p>I don&#x27;t think Twitter is the wrong format to tell this story: probably more people read it as a result, and that&#x27;s to the good. But I will note that one thing about blog posts is that the format encourages editing and revision, while Twitter encourages spontaneity. In this case, the story could have benefited from a second draft for the sake of clarity.

            That&#x27;s funny, just this week I was writing an AI for a creature in a side-project game that uses this exact same heuristic of getting away n nav-mesh nodes away from the player. Something to keep in mind I suppose.

            I totally disagree on the format, FWIW.<p>When I see a link to a Twitter thread, I know immediately what to expect. I know that the formatting will be consistent. I know that the site will be accessible and at least somewhat readable. I can see the reactions of other people to the content immediately. I can interact with the author in a uniform and easy way, if I want to. I know that the content likely won’t be too long.<p>This without even mentioning the benefits to the <i>writer</i> of the post. Twitter is free. It’s widely used, so you can get <i>way</i> more impressions that you’d ever get on a blog. It allows you to immediately see and interact with people reading your posts - it’s incredibly painful to do that with a blog that you host. It gives you decent analytics. It’s obviously way easier than hosting a blog.<p>Of course, blogs have many advantages too. Blog posts and Tweet threads solve two different problems.

            A blog post requires an account with a blogging provider or a hosting provider though, so I wouldn&#x27;t call it a lower barrier if you don&#x27;t have it.<p>Besides that, the context matters here. This post is riding off of the attention that another Skyrim WTF bug got recently, which was posted on Twitter. Continuing the conversation there seems like the lowest barrier to entry to me, considering that the author already has a Twitter account and a following there, especially if you actually want to reach people that might find it interesting.

            Nitter is wonderful, but has limitations:<p>- It still tends to include too much per-tweet overhead in presentation.<p>- It limits the length of the full thread presented.<p>- Individual nodes frequently go down and&#x2F;or are rate-limited by Twitter.

            Seems similar to gravity compressing spacetime causing matter to pathfind towards itself. Treasure compresses navmesh causing a kind of gravity for the Fox AI pathfinding.<p>So in a way spacetime could be thought of as a navmesh that the simulation for the universe uses to path objects.

            The speed of computing a path from vertex to vertex is faster than trying to generate a point at X distance for the pathing object.<p>So you give the NPC a speed, and it moves as far along the edges between vertexes in each time interval.<p>The navmesh also helps keep the AI traveling in places that have been marked as safe for travel, without collision or drops.

            I wonder if this is just actually not true, but was a hamfisted way of explaining what was happening.<p>In the low-density mesh which the fox uses, there are more nodes around treasure, and because edges connect nodes, more of the edges in uninteresting space lead towards treasure. So just by picking random edges, or edges away from the player, you are likely to end up near treasure. It&#x27;s a bit like the is fox moving through a non-Euclidean space which has more volume near treasure.<p>Because measuring distance by hops would be absolutely daft.

            Easiest way to pick a valid random location is to pick the center of a nav triangle. They could have traversed the nav mesh counting distance instead of just triangles but I guess they didn&#x27;t and it worked out fine for the game.

            In particular if you&#x27;re doing pathing for tons of npcs (as they are) you really want to keep that optimized. In Guild Wars at launch for one of our expansions we had huge CPU issues with our game servers - it turned out designers had laid down really long elaborate paths for NPCs like guards and townspeople and the server was calculating all those paths at once when players entered a new zone, so it was saturating the game server. I had to build an auditing tool so we could scan all the zones for long paths and replace them with simple ones.<p>Bethesda has been building this specific type of game for decades so at this point things like npcs having complex patrols or other behavior is something they&#x27;ve figured out how to do well.

            The twitter thread isn&#x27;t super clear about the exact mechanics. But If I had to guess, maybe the fleeing fox randomly chooses the path to follow, and because there are more possible paths in the dense parts of the map the odds of selecting one of those is higher. i.e. if I have 6 possible paths to my right, two to my front, and two to my left, if I randomly pick a path there is a 60% change of going right.

            This only works if the camps mesh is really wide, black hole style.<p>If you enter the camp and it gets high suddenly, nothing is changed, since as a player you know you are in a camp.<p>The fact the fox stays, chewing through triangles, rather than running though like it would if it was based on meters doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Although, since the fox stays in the camp, you would <i>think</i> it was telling you something, even though it was random chance.

            As I understood that is that the fox is looking for the longest path (e.g. distance defined by breadth-first search) and longest paths are usually the ones that lead you to treasure because treasure is hidden deep within levels

            That&#x27;s funny, I understand it as the exact opposite. The fox is tasked with finding the shortest path that hits 100 points. This leads it to the closest high point density area.

            &gt; looking for the longest path<p>&gt; &quot;The Fox isn&#x27;t trying to get 100 meters away - it&#x27;s trying to get 100 <i>triangles</i> away.&quot;<p>Breadth-first search wouldn&#x27;t be possible.

            In Ghost of Tsushima, foxes lead the player to shrines, which grant certain items. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you can befriend dogs by feeding them and they&#x27;ll lead you to treasure. Not foxes sure, but almost the same thing. I wonder if the developers of these games were inspired by Skyrim&#x27;s &quot;feature&quot;.

            I don&#x27;t know for sure, but there is quite a lot of lore around foxes and dogs, see Kitsune and Komainu for example.<p>Since Zelda is a Nintendo game and Ghost of Tsushima is set in Japan, I would think it has more to do with real world lore than a reference to Skyrim.

            I don&#x27;t know about Japan, but as far as I know the fox tradition in China has no element of leading people anywhere. Foxes, like anything else, may practice various magical arts notably including shapeshifting. (They are much more common as the subject of stories than other things are, but not very different in kind.) They may pursue any number of idiosyncratic goals. A common theme is that they take the form of a human woman and have sex with a human man; this may either be benign behavior or something more nefarious such as a way to slowly drain the man&#x27;s life force.<p>The sexual theme is so common that 狐狸精 &quot;fox spirit&quot; became a term of abuse for overly sexual women. Chinese people like to translate the term into English as &quot;vixen&quot;.

            I&#x27;m playing Skyrim now and the thought that the foxes would lead me to treasure has indeed popped into my mind. I followed one for a while but it didn&#x27;t lead me anywhere notable.<p>Most animals either do a really good job of running away from you (rabbits, deer), or attack you (lions, walruses). Foxes just look at you and slowly walk into a certain direction when you get close to them, as if they&#x27;re trying to show you something.<p>In general also, from watching YouTube videos of rescue foxes, they seem like super playful and might be the kind of animals leading you to treasure just for the fun of it.

            Having to login to Twitter to read a thread is really annoying.

            I know this is an overused trope but I have had enough of every social media platform becoming increasingly hostile and annoying. It&#x27;s like they have hit the cap of how many people on the planet are actually interested in signing up for twitter and now have to tighten the screws on every aspect to try to force the last bits of possible growth.<p>Dumb question I know, but why can&#x27;t we just have platforms that are satisfied with what they are and not expect constant growth at any cost.

            Yep, platforms are getting silly. On Reddit the other day I got the usual popup about accepting cookies, but once clicked, instead of just setting the cookie it showed a popup saying that I need to switch to the new theme to accept cookies. As in, I&#x27;m forced to use their new theme just to click a button and then switch back to using the old theme (like any sane person).

            &gt; like any sane person<p>I wonder if the sluggish UX that comes with a heavy JS SPA cuts into their sales.<p>I spend more time on HN now, though I was a heavy Reddit user, because Reddit users on the new UI being able to comment with images cramp my well-thought-out arguments.

            Because if you do, your competitors won&#x27;t, and will poach your customers with hard sell techniques until they reach a network effect required to make you irrelevant.<p>In the long run, there can be only one, the little diversity we have is the effect of national network effects established in the first years of growth that proved hard to overcome, especially Twitter in US. Without US, Twitter will be steamrolled and you will only have exotic alternatives like vkontakte and weibo.

            That’s a good point.  If I had to guess, I think over time there is a natural limit to the amount of user saturation.  People are mostly aware of the platforms and their features and have probably made up their minds as to whether they want to join.  Parts of the existing user base are probably getting sick of the engagement and lessening their usage.

            I mentioned this elsewhere, and I don&#x27;t mean to copy-paste, but take a look at some public nitter instances if this is a problem you regularly run into: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zedeus&#x2F;nitter&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Instances" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zedeus&#x2F;nitter&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Instances</a><p>Nitter allows viewing threads like these without logging in or even enabling Javascript.

            It&#x27;s amazing how good humans are at detecting these sorts of patterns.<p>For another example, in minecraft, people noticed you can find diamonds if you dig straight down from clay patches. At first I dismissed it as superstition but it turns out that are technical reasons for why! You can watch <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5Icj5TNmBUI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5Icj5TNmBUI</a> for details but the tldr is that due to how minecraft seeds their linear congruential random number generator, whenever there aren&#x27;t carries&#x2F;overflows the coordinates are always a fixed offset away.
