            I&#x27;ve got Dyson Sphere on my backlog; at the moment I finally budget and bought Satisfactory, it looks really well fleshed out at the moment and it&#x27;ll take me hours and hours of more work to lay out my factory just to get the second package up the space elevator. Love it.

            Good choice. DSP is a bit more for the veteran, you kind of have to obsess over this genre to enjoy DSP.<p>Satisfactory can be enjoyed by a wider audience, however. As can Factorio.

            Satisfactory is an incredible game. Maybe my favorite of the last two years. And it isn’t even completed. Beautiful, coherent, well optimized, unbelievably huge content, without limits to the player’s creativity.<p>If anyone reading this loved building factories in factorio and building huge buildings in Minecraft, try Satisfactory now.

            It could be the nature of the progression through the games, but I think there&#x27;s a &quot;what a grind&quot; plateau in the arc of both games, and I would guess it comes at about the 60% in both (for me)<p>If you haven&#x27;t played DSP since they introduced blueprints, I&#x27;d encourage you to give it a revisit. Although ironically the mass <i>deconstruction</i> in Factorio is equally handy but is still missing in DSP, which can make any rework still be a grind

            Oh snap, when did blueprints get added to DSP?<p>I bought it about a week after it became available on Steam and played it all the way through (Unlocked the last item in the tech tree) and wanted to try again with some different gameplay options, but not until blueprints were implemented.  I must have missed the announcement.

            To me, space is not static. Black holes, as probably all objects in space, are continuously moving and rotating. I don&#x27;t think gravity waves are fully understood. I doubt they would be constant for black holes. There would also be continuous ingestion of objects from afar, small or large. So with all these volatilities, how would one maintain a stable orbit to construct the sphere adjusting for tsunamis of gravity waves, bombardments by objects passing or entering the black holes, and flares of radiation escaping from the center? And what could one do to make sure the black hole stays in the center of the sphere? It&#x27;s a logistical nightmare.

            The whole concept of a Dyson sphere is kinda idiotic.  Any civilization that is capable to build one, it is probably able to work out fusion energy very efficiently.<p>There is no point to go and harness energy around a star or a black hole, when you can just produce it locally with a lot less resources&#x2F;waste and materials.  The sun itself is actually very inefficient in producing energy.<p>There is no need to harness the sun million of km away,  when you can recreate it in your home planet. The only way to produce a dyson like of sphere, is to tame an over-heated sun, and reflect away un-needed energy.  But there is no point to build one to just harness it.<p>It makes great sci-fi stories, but that&#x27;s about it. Scientifically, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense.

            Because to power a type 2 civilization you need around 4 * 10^26W (as the paper states). Over a year that is around 10^31 kWh worth of energy. Assuming fusion can transform 1% of the input mass in energy you need ~ 1.4 * 10^19 kg per year. To put that number into perspective mount Everest weights 2.7×10^14 kg [1] so thousands Everests worth of mass.<p>That is a lot of mass to extract and transport to the power stations (accelerate, decelerate). So it just makes sense to only needing to build the facilities to collect the power from existing sources (stars, black holes) without the logistics of transporting the fuel.<p>Moreover, the space around a star or black hole is real estate that would go unused otherwise, while asteroids, moons, ... are more likely usable by such an advanced civilization.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-would-the-estimated-weight-of-Mount-Everest-be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-would-the-estimated-weight-of-Mou...</a> (I took the highest estimate in the first answer)

            The counter is that most of the usable mass in the universe is in interstellar objects such as comets and free planets which are 50% water ice or so,  rich in organic materials and can be consumed completely to build habitats.<p>With D + D fusion (easy to believe compared to CNO) an interstellar civilization could be essentially independent of stars.<p>I&#x27;m sure part of the resolution of the Fermi paradox is that dry inside-the-frost-line planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are not the generic places you find life.<p>If things were a bit different I could see a would-be Galileo on an less cooked version of Io or a more cooked version of Europa who looks at the Earth with a spectroscope and sees oxygen and has a huge amount of trouble with his local &quot;church&quot; that thinks it is impossible to have life on a planet with less tidal activity,  less radiation,  inside-the-frost-line dryness,  etc.<p>Even if creatures like us became interstellar we might have millions of kilometers of condominiums and shopping malls in the oort cloud and could care less about inner solar system planets.

            There is a point still, because a star is massively more efficient at fusion by way of &quot;production at scale&quot; effects.<p>The additional benefit is the amount of power. With the power of a star at your disposal, beaming your energy using lasers and microwaves, even if only 1% efficient, would instantly solve the energy needs of any planet in a solar system. If we did it, we could instantly colonize all planets in our solar system because things like &quot;running an AC on Mercury&quot; or &quot;Hovercraft in Jupiter Atmosphere&quot; becomes trivial when you have limitless power.<p>Heck, you could start projects like moving planets in orbits or collecting astroids to built a planet if you wanted.<p>Black holes are the stage after that since you can use a spinning black hole to convert a given mass into energy at &gt;10% efficiency (given E=MC^2). That would allow a civilization to power multiple solar systems at the cost of a few planets per year.<p>Granted, the sphere is difficult to build, but that is what you have dyson swarms for.

            The sphere isn&#x27;t difficult to build. It&#x27;s impossible to build.<p>It&#x27;s unstable without active stabilisation. The stabilisation has to be <i>perfect</i> because otherwise you get massive distorting spherequakes propagating through it, which will make it a very uncomfortable ride for a short time and will soon tear it apart.<p>A perfect spherical stabilising solution with components and sensors that are light minutes - or possibly light hours - from each other is impossible because of the signalling delays.<p>Ringworlds have the same problem.

            But the effort required to build such a structure, even if physically possible is far more than building the equivalent in a swarm and the utility of such a swarm is greater especially when you consider that the typical sci-fi trope of living on the surface inside of that sphere is ruined by the complete absence of any gravity exerted by the actual sphere on that surface. This means that all of those hapless residents would instead get pulled from the surface into the star in the centre.<p>This is precisely the appeal of Larry Niven&#x27;s Ringworld concept. You instead take a slice of that sphere and spin it around the star and generate gravity through centrifugal force. They can take a number of configurations but the default one would give you the equivalent of 2 million earth&#x27;s worth of living space inside one continual surface. This is obviously hugely mass intensive and having a ring of that kind of radius spinning at the tangential velocities required for the equivalent of one g of simulated gravity (around 1200 km&#x2F;s) requires materials so magically strong that they make graphene look like soggy tissues. The only material that could do this even in the theoretical realm is magmatter, which would be materials constructed out of magnetic monopoles, something that has been predicted to exist by some but has yet to be observed.<p>However, you could construct one using known materials by creating a superstructure around the ring that is much more massive and orbits the other direction at normal orbital speeds for a body about an AU out from the sun with the ringworld electromagnetically suspended from the superstructure, normalising their collective momentum to zero. That obviously greatly increase the mass requirements but this could mostly take the form of hydrogen and helium which is far more abundant than heavier elements and would be usable as fuel for fusion reactors. That superstructure can contain many smaller rotating habitats and the whole thing could be used as a vast habitat for microgravity living as well - something I envision as many humans doing as living on worlds with gravity by the time we would have constructed one of these.<p>You also want to have a superstructure because at such a high tangential velocity, if a human being of 80 kg struck the ring from the outside, it would blow with the kinetic energy of a thermonuclear bomb. Point defence is absolutely necessary and the superstucture offers both an excellent shield covering the non sun lit side of the ring and a great platform for hosting those point defence systems. Ringworlds are also not in stable orbital configurations over astronomical timescales so you need to maintain their orbit through corrective thrust. This could be done through light sails which would also be appealing for it&#x27;s mechanical simplicity.<p>Ringworlds are <i>very</i> mass intensive especially if your civilisation still has no access to unobtanium building materials and I don&#x27;t think this would be something we would ever build a lot of in our particular solar system but even with that mass cost, you could easily gather enough rocky material from the sun to build a few and still have the vast majority of people living in other far smaller structures (but only relative to a star encompassing ring) in the swarm.

            The expansion joints will throw off the center of mass of the entire shell, leading to a positive feedback loop of orbit decay and expansion compensation.

            You need a force to balance the change in orbital velocity due to expansion or contraction of an expansion joint of a fully connected shell; otherwise, the shell will begin to wobble.  The forces would be enormous and tear the shell apart from multiple places.<p>One solution is for the expansion joints to have infinite range— a disconnected swarm of platforms which is exactly what a Dyson swarm is.

            &gt; We already have access to far more energy than we could possibly use on earth for any technology that&#x27;s actually buildable. But we&#x27;re not using it because we don&#x27;t have the species IQ to make the right choices.<p>That&#x27;s an interesting take. It does seem that we&#x27;re more limited by our poor choices than by underlying physical limits. We invest ridiculous amounts of money into weapons by comparison to things like nuclear and fusion power.

            Build a small ring at a Lagrange point using hinged plates. Gradually expand it until its diameter is 2 AU. Spin it slowly to keep it round. Use rockets to move it into position around the sun. Use stabilizer rockets to keep it in position.<p>Repeat at 90 degrees, 45 degrees, etc until you have a sphere.<p>You&#x27;re right that speed-of-light delays make negative feedback control difficult, but it might be possible to have rockets that sense local photon flux on the inner surface of the ring&#x2F;sphere and fire autonomously when it increases.

If you have two competing populations and one multiplies and expands just slightly better than the other, everything else equal, then that one will eventually outcompete the slower one.<p>But it does not have to be that way. Humans are the top predator, so no competition here. We could make do with limiting expansion if we chose to.

Agriculture, mining, and technological advancement are peculiar to humans.  All of these permit us to live longer, with fewer setbacks, and in environments no other animals can survive (space, and soon other planets).  Are these not exceptional traits?<p>We can also engineer a virus, or deploy strategic weapons that could wipe out our entire species (and a bunch of others).  Is that not exceptional?

            Yes.  We are likely living in an early age of the Universe, but a middle-to-later age of the solar system.

            It depends on how you define &quot;early age&quot; for the universe. Of course it can go on a <i>long</i> time, so in that sense the universe is extremely early age. On the other hand most of the stars that will ever exist have already been born, and every moment that goes by more parts of the universe move forever out of our reach due to the expansion of space. The universe may last forever but most of the action has already happened.

            &gt; impossible to build<p>Yet there are actual dust rings and discs in the sky surrounding stars for long periods without falling into the star, being blown out of the gravitational influence of the star, or condensing into planets on life-evolving timescales.<p>Some of them are pretty occlusive and get hot (~ 1000 degC) and are consequentially observational targets for MATISSE at the European Southern Observatory.   It&#x27;s not at all my field, but I gather <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theskylive.com&#x2F;sky&#x2F;stars&#x2F;kappa-tucanae-star" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theskylive.com&#x2F;sky&#x2F;stars&#x2F;kappa-tucanae-star</a> is a principal hot dust belt target.<p>Retreating towards my islands of comfort, there are plenty of small rocky bodies ( flavour of &quot;dust&quot; in the sense of the previous paragraphs) in the solar system that are in no immediate danger of colliding, plunging inwards, or escaping to infinity in spite of ablation from solar radiation, differential radiation pressure and other effects that lead to the term &quot;active asteroid&quot;.  Most of them will be there, and have been there, for billions of years despite evil Jupiter trying to mess them up.  Speculating a little away from my weak-gravity island, I would be surprised if there were no ongoing organic chemistry reactions in the more icy carbonaceous active asteroids in our solar system.  It&#x27;s not a huge leap from that to an asteroid-based power station that slowly produces some alcohol(s) at <i>much</i> denser concentrations than the wood alcohol molecular clouds like in W3(OH) astrophysical alcohol megamaser region. [1]<p>Icy-carbonaceous bodies in closer orbit and with sufficient spin angular momentum (perhaps supported by the Yarkovsky effect) for cheap thermal management could in principle host terrestrial photoautotrophs suitable for processing into biodiesel.  Impractical at small scale, but maybe useful if one has many billions of such &quot;power plants&quot; around a single star.   And of course, one could use the photoautotrophs to feed microbes more suitable for the production of more complicated molecules like, oh I dunno, oxycodone (for fun and profit).<p>(A sufficiently dense dust belt in the goldilocks zone could even make use of ideas from the panspermia hypothesis, so that one only has to populate an initial fraction of the bodies with economically useful microbes, and the little bugs will reproduce and spread throughout.)<p>One can easily imagine greater efficiencies from engineering non-organism power collectors and storage systems instead of adapting blue-green algae to output biological compounds, and one would probably want to do this for a dust that is in bulk much hotter than the vast majority of our solar system&#x27;s asteroids tend to get, or if practically the entirety of the dust is <i>manufactured</i> rather than already in place ready for populating with mats or colonies of economically useful microbes.<p>Returning to the paper at the top, I think the only advantage a black hole gives is that a sufficiently large one might have a much larger localised &quot;goldilocks&quot; volume which one might seed with small icy-carbonaceous body light-powered power plants, compared to having many such belts around many many stars.   However density of production could be an important advantage, even if one has to move a swarm of objects to it rather than adapt a swarm of substrate objects already in place.<p>Super-concisely: Earth has a lot of oil, inefficiently, seemingly by accident, after a long delay from initial &quot;activation&quot; of the biosphere, and with a fairly high collection cost because it below so much atmosphere (and water and rock) through which it would have to be lifted for off-world use.   Sufficiently advanced aliens (and perhaps future humans), if they wanted oil, undoubtedly could do better than Earth.<p>- --<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.star.bris.ac.uk&#x2F;mark&#x2F;w3oh.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.star.bris.ac.uk&#x2F;mark&#x2F;w3oh.html</a> but don&#x27;t inhale it, the W is for Wood alcohol (hydroxymethane).

            The whole concept of a Dyson sphere is kinda idiotic.  Any species that has Malthusians will never get to where it needs a Dyson sphere because their Malthusians lack vision and make up for that in hate.  It&#x27;s a safe bet that any species with IQ less than about 130 on a human scale will have a surfeit of Malthusians.  Looking around HN, we have lots of Malthusians in our species.<p>EDIT: Inb4 the downvotes.

            As others pointed out, it depends on your energy needs. You need matter for fusion and almost all of the matter of the solar system is in the sun so you can either extract mass from the sun and do the fusion yourself or... let the sun do the fusion, as it already does, and just harness that

            That solar corona really <i>hates</i> your molecular bonds passionately.   It&#x27;s not too keen on metal crystals either.  It&#x27;s hard to see how to ignore that level of hatred as one approaches the photosphere en route to scooping out stuff below that, especially if it flares or reconnects through you and your gear &quot;in close orbit around the star&#x27;s equator&quot;.   Your gear and repair &amp; installation techs are much safer a couple gigametres away.<p>If you really want to extract <i>mass</i> from a star, just wait long enough, or find one ready to release a suitable amount.  There are plenty of options from CMAs to flares to UV Ceti style flare stars, to deflagrating white dwarfs, novas, and supernovas.    Let the star&#x27;s nuclear energy do the &quot;heavy lifting&quot;, eliminating all the problems catalogued before the &quot;... plasma jets hundreds or thousands of astronomical units long ... [t]he details of extracting useful materials from [that has] not been extensively explored&quot;.<p>(The linked article at the top discusses relativistic jets driven by million-solar-mass and larger black holes.  The jets are likely to be more constant and&#x2F;or more predictable than natural mass outflows from stars, but extracting and storing energy from that is even less &quot;extensively explored&quot;.  An option in between is to use the natural mass flow from a companion star onto a compact star (white dwarf, neutron star, black hole) by sticking the moral equivalent of a water wheel into the stream.  It&#x27;s just a (compared to water hot &amp; sparse) fluid flowing downhill, and there are plenty of examples in our galaxy.)

            Ok, earth sized is mainly about 1 g. So yes, also with earths density to be precice. That leaves only venus as a existing alternative.<p>And I just assume that a civilisation advanced enough to build a dyson sphere, can handle the non trivial orbital mechanics, too. But maybe still cannot travel FTL. So indeed rather choose to build planets, or planet sized space stations.<p>That would require lots of energy and maybe the need to harvest the sun directly and control the light going out towards the planets.

            I agree but I would say that any advanced enough civilisation will even be able to eliminate the need to grow their population and energy requirements.<p>I don&#x27;t see any requirement why an intelligent civilisation would need to grow its population forever.

The rest of the solar system is about 3×10^27 kilograms and we kind of need it to live on and make things with. Put in other words, the entire solar system including the Sun is 1.0014 Solar masses. Why not go with the process we have rather than fusing everything we have to do the same thing?<p>If you&#x27;re saying that we don&#x27;t need that much energy then I think that&#x27;s pretty meaningless since we have no idea what we could get up to or need in the far future.

            This comment demonstrates both confusion of the Dyson sphere concept with it&#x27;s sci-fi bastardisation as well as a lack of understanding of scale, and especially of the mechanics of black hole power production. Dyson spheres (or Dyson swarms as they are often called to prevent such confusion) were never originally envisioned as a single impossibly large rigid sphere encompassing a star. They are rather a massive collection of structures that are able to utilize all the energy output of a star. This means that you could start construction on one today in an iterative fashion and immediately benefit from it.<p>The technology required to build a tier 1 swarm is not advanced. All you need is the ability to build a thin reflector (aluminium foil would work) with radio and a basic onboard computer. You do not even need onboard propellant because a reflector can generate the required thrust for minor corrections with solar pressure alone. These reflectors can then concentrate that light from close in to the star out to collectors further out in the system. This essentially makes your habitable zone as large as you want since you can also light entire planets this way and only utilize less than a percent of a percent of your total energy budget.<p>The real challenge is having good enough automation to construct and send these stations out without requiring too much oversight, and getting good enough at construction off earth (since you really don&#x27;t want to deal with that gravity well). We&#x27;re definitely close to having the required automation technology and we should be performing the first manufacturing off earth before the end of the next decade.<p>Artificial fusion can be made far more efficient than the fusion in the core of our sun, yes. However, the sun outputs enough energy to light 2 billion earths worth of surface. Moreover, it essentially contains all of both the hydrogen and rocky material in the solar system with the other bodies being essentially a rounding error in comparison, so even in a controlled fusion based economy, you would still create a Dyson sphere like construct since you would be using that star as your main fuel and mass source.<p>Black holes though? They make even aneutronic fusion look like a fire cracker in comparison. You&#x27;re getting less than a percent mass energy conversion with even the best theoretical fusion models there are, whereas with black holes, you can get anywhere from 16% to 40% depending on the technique and mass range of the black hole. Stellar black holes have so much energy inside that they would dwarf even our star (consider that their progenitors were stars with far more mass than our own and with an even bigger disparity in power output). They also last for periods of time that make even red dwarfs look like still births. If you could make artificial ones in the gigaton and megaton ranges, then they can also make for amazing batteries. In this case, you are able to tap the hawking radiation emitted for power and this promises potentially even greater efficiencies than the stellar mass ones (albeit, you would not be gaining a net power gain here, this is strictly for power storage and potentially gravity generation purposes).

            Why does man use hydro-power even though it is a rather silly idea if he has the technological prowess to generate a lot more power basically at will, basically anywhere, with a lot less resources destroyed, thanks to nuclear energy?<p>Well, hydro energy is just there, requires comparatively little ongoing maintenance, and has less catastrophic failure modes.<p>I think the same caveats work for Dyson spheres.

            I am not claiming we should not have dams, or refrain from using dams to provide hydroelectricity. My point of contention is the assertion that hydro energy has less catastrophic failure modes than nuclear (presumably fission). Clearly the failure modes for hydro dams are at least on par with those of nuclear installations, given that we have historic evidence that they can inflict tens of thousands of casualties.<p>Hypothetical scenarios can be constructed for both methods of power generation (What if Braidwood plant melts down, somehow killing the 5 million people living within a 50 mile radius? What if the Three Gorges Dam busts, inundating an area inhabited by 600 million people?[1]) Either way, it is far from obvious to me that hydro has the superior safety profile, especially when their fatality rates are on the same order of magnitude even when the Banqiao incident is removed[2]*.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210620174812&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.japantimes.co.j" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210620174812&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.japan...</a>

            The temperature T associated with a black hole&#x27;s Hawking radiation goes as 1&#x2F;M, where M is the black hole&#x27;s mass, i.e. it <i>decreases</i> with M. Meanwhile, its surface area A goes as M². Plugging this into the Stefan-Boltzmann law yields a total power output P of<p>P ~ A · T⁴ ~ 1&#x2F;M²<p>So while a larger total amount of energy can be extracted from a supermassive black hole (because it&#x27;s more massive – duh), it also takes <i>much</i> (much!) longer to extract a given amount of energy: A supermassive black hole&#x27;s mass is in the order of 10⁶ to 10⁹ solar masses, i.e. 10⁶ to 10⁹ times the mass of a stellar-mass black hole, meaning that its power is just 10^-12 to 10^-18 × the power of a stellar mass black hole.

If it was split up into several or thousands of much smaller black holes they, being much smaller would give off energy faster.<p>Energy is energy wouldn’t a matter black hole and an anti matter black hole just make a black twice the size, minus a bit for gravity waves.<p>I was thinking given a large enough gravity wave it might be able to stretch a black hole apart.

            Oh, you wouldn&#x27;t want to be able to split up black holes, since that means they could be destroyed during warfare.<p>Depending on what the cosmological constant is, massive black holes could be quite useful in the far future. 10^100 years from now, long after all the stars have gone out, it could be the case that the only life in the universe would be huddled up against the event horizon of supermassive black holes, exploiting the tiny temperature difference between the pseudosurface and the void to generate a trickle of power.<p>Splitting black holes would rob the far future of that power source to be used now. You <i>could</i> do it, but why shorten the useful life of the universe?

            Yeah, making tiny black holes could be pretty challenging, but I feel like it&#x27;s just an engineering challenge.  Is there a fundamental reason I&#x27;m missing that you can&#x27;t just build a really precise, solar-system-scale particle accelerator to slam together a lot of mass into a tiny space to make tiny black holes?

            Crane and Westmoreland looked into this: &quot;Are Black Hole Starships Possible&quot; (2009) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;0908.1803v1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;0908.1803v1</a><p>A black hole is generated when mass-energy density is above a certain threshold. You need to pack about a megatonne of mass-energy in a sphere 3 attometers in diameter to get a black hole approaching a useful lifespan. You could do it with bosonic matter, but photons are easier. Well, &quot;easier&quot;:<p>&gt;In Section V below, we discuss the plausibility of creating SBHs with a
very large spherically converging gamma ray laser. A radius of 1 attometer
corresponds to the wavelength of a gamma ray with an energy of about 1.24
TeV. Since the wavelength of the Hawking radiation is 8π^2
times the radius of the BH, the Hawking temperature of a BH with this radius is on the order of
16 GeV, within the limit of what we could hope to achieve technologically.<p>&gt;[...]<p>&gt;In a previous paper by the first author [9], it was proposed that a SBH could
be artificially created by firing a huge number of gamma rays from a spherically
converging laser. The idea is to pack so much energy into such a small space
that a BH will form. An advantage of using photons is that, since they are
bosons, there is no Pauli exclusion principle to worry about. Although a laser
powered black hole generator presents huge engineering challenges, the concept
appears to be physically sound according to classical general relativity.<p>The process of aligning the laser array will be interesting, however. From Wikipedia:<p>&gt;Unlike most objects, a black hole&#x27;s temperature increases as it radiates away mass. The rate of temperature increase is exponential, with the most likely endpoint being the dissolution of the black hole in a violent burst of gamma rays. A complete description of this dissolution requires a model of quantum gravity, however, as it occurs when the black hole&#x27;s mass approaches 1 Planck mass, when its radius will also approach two Planck lengths.<p>See table 2 from the paper. A 0.32 attometer wide black hole has a surface temperature of 98.1GeV and is losing 61.4 kilograms per second-- 5,519 petawatts of ultra-hard gamma radiation! Even at that diameter it has a sizable weight of 108,000 tonnes, but it doesn&#x27;t have long to live-- a couple weeks. A poorly collimated laser array will produce undersize black holes which will rapidly evaporate. The paper suggests keeping them well away from Earth, on the other side of the Sun if possible. Not hard-- you&#x27;d want to put the array well within the orbit of Mercury for better solar power flux.

            This is great, thanks!  I hadn&#x27;t thought about the Pauli exclusion principle problem, which I guess tells you how well I&#x27;d understood the problem.  And of course I don&#x27;t know anything about quantum gravity.  I was thinking that, for use as a power plant, you want much larger black holes, not only bigger than a proton, but actually bigger than an atom, on the order of a nanometer, for two reasons: first, so that the gamma rays coming out are reasonably low energy (hundreds or thousands of electron volts instead of GeV); second, so that you can continue feeding it with regular baryons instead of keeping your spherically converging laser focused on it.  But if you do that, you only get a tiny fraction of a watt out of it, and it&#x27;s uselessly inefficient; even if you made trillions of these little black holes, the energy payback time of the project is measured in octillions of years if you&#x27;re feeding useful photons into them.<p>So the sub-attometer-sized black holes described here seem like they might be a lot more practical than what I was thinking of.  But... what does it take to stop TeV gamma rays?  (And I guess they might also spew out strange matter and naked truth and the like, but you could probably just toss it back in.)<p>The billion-tonne gamma-ray laser they&#x27;re talking about here is absolutely <i>tiny</i>.

            &gt; but you could probably just toss it back in.<p>The thing with very small black holes is that they&#x27;re virtually impossible to feed stuff into - not only are they an extremely small target, but the flood of energy escaping will push away any matter that comes nearby.

Let&#x27;s talk bare minimums. Say the nucleus of an hydrogen atom is about 2.4 femtometers wide. Plugging the numbers into <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vttoth.com&#x2F;CMS&#x2F;physics-notes&#x2F;311-hawking-radiation-calculator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vttoth.com&#x2F;CMS&#x2F;physics-notes&#x2F;311-hawking-radiati...</a> the mass of a black hole that size is 8.07991 * 10^8 metric tons. That is a <i>lot</i> of laser pulse power to get into a single point just to create the black hole. Wolfram alpha claims it&#x27;s 2.01718 x 10^25 watthours. The sun radiates 3.828 x 10^26 watts, so we need about a tenth of <i>total</i> solar output for an hour-- assuming we can convert captured solar power into coherent gamma rays with no loss, which there is currently no plausible physical way to do, so we probably need 10 or 100 times as much power. We&#x27;re beyond future ultratech, and getting into solar engineering.<p>Assuming the black hole is created, which is hard enough, we have further problems. A 2.4 femtometer black hole is still darn hot: it&#x27;s radiating a total of 545.6 megawatts of light with a peak of 51.3 MeV-- still ultrahard gamma radiation. Our beam of hydrogen ions need to fight past this headwind and into the singularity-- quickly. It&#x27;s losing 6.054 micrograms per second, which will be hard to deliver as a single row of hydrogen nuclei.<p>Making the black hole bigger in the first place will make it easier to feed... but if you can commandeer a tenth of the Sun&#x27;s output at will, you don&#x27;t exactly need domestic power from a black hole.

            They’d be more useful as an energy source for ships than as a power plant. You would make them in a solar system where lots of energy is available and use them to power a ship going to a different star system, one with no infrastructure of its own. Once you’ve arrived, you colonize and eventually build your own Dyson swarm to harvest the energy to make them yourself.

            It’s just too much mass in too little space. It’s essentially the same requirement as fusion, but almost infinitely more difficult.<p>If you could make a fusion reactor almost infinitely better then it would produce a black hole which would immediately evaporate releasing more energy than you could ever imagine - but no way it can be done.

            Hawking radiation propulsion has the perfect specific impulse: exhaust velocity is the speed of light. Black hole hawking radiation also is perfectly efficient: 100% of the mass is converted into energy. D-T fusion only converts 0.4% of the mass to energy.<p>There are many awful engineering problems of a black hole drive, but they&#x27;re not so bad as to dismiss out of hand.

            You know, if you asked Christiaan Huygens in 01671 about the possibility of detecting a 4-km-long tunnel getting shorter by a factor of one in a sextillion for a hundredth of a second, he surely would have doubted that it was possible.  But it&#x27;s only been 350 years, and when LIGO detected its first gravitational waves five years ago, that&#x27;s precisely how it did it.<p>By contrast, there&#x27;s ample reason to believe that black-hole power plants are possible.  In fact, the spatial precision required is actually the same order of magnitude as that of LIGO, about an attometer.  So we might not even have to wait 350 years for it.

            Well, in some sense, black holes are the least interesting objects in the universe - they are entirely characterized by their mass and angular velocity (possibly charge as well?).

            It&#x27;s possible, but as long as that stuff stays <i>inside</i>, we have no reason to care (or even tell) whether &quot;<i>inside</i> they are much more complex than a hypothetical singularity&quot;.<p>The central theoretical problem is that taking Hawking seriously, the stuff inside stays inside, but inside goes away.  What happens to the stuff?   There are more theoretical answers to that written down than there are actual theorists, and presently no astronomical or laboratory observations which let us throw practically any of them away.<p>(Also of course, inside might not go away after all -- not at all or not completely -- with large numbers of explanations of how that might work, and nothing concretely observed that lets us discount such possibilities in favour of total evaporation.)

            Depends on the universe.<p>Let&#x27;s use your parenthetical as an excuse to keep charge vanishingly small, because we can avoid thinking &quot;<i>Which</i> charge? Which charge carrier or carriers? What&#x27;s the distribution of charges?&quot;, and largely ignore the electro- effects of electrovacuum (which answers these, but in surprising ways when you look deeply).<p>In a chargeless <i>vacuum</i> Schwarzschild or Kerr universe, we have total coordinate freedom because there is nothing there but the mass at an infintesimally small point, p.  If one builds a system of coordinates with p always at a single spacelike point (say, the spacelike origin), then the symmetries of this <i>vacuum</i> system let one chop away spatial position (e.g. const.coord.x, const.coord.y, const.coord.z, t -&gt; 0,0,0,t) and consequently the vector-quantity linear momenta of the black hole vanish.   Moreover, these vacuum spacetimes are also eternal (the black holes do not grow or shrink), so we can do t = const. too.  With suitable coordinates, gives us two free parameters: mass &amp; spin (and in Schwarzschild, just one: mass).<p>These solutions do not superpose additively.  By the Raychaudhuri focusing theorem, if we add a point mass to the Schwarzschild black hole universe, the two masses will eventually collide.  We have broken the spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild solution, and when we solve the geodesic equations, we find <i>caustics</i>, where our two infinitesimal masses can be in the same infinitesimal space.   We have also broken time symmetry: at past time the two masses are spacelike separated.  In the future they are not, as they will merge into one black hole.  We also have the problem that the black holes move with respect to one another, so we either adapt or system of coordinates to be comoving with the black holes, or we have one or both of them move against the spatial-coordinate part of our system of coordinates.<p>When we take this further by breaking other symmetries than the time one, e.g. by adding angular momentum to the system, we have to consider the evolution of orbital angular momentum of the pair, and possibly the spin angular momentum of each. Either of our previous-paragraph choices with respect to encoding the coordinate evolution of the spatial distance between the pair of black holes complicates the calculation of the related vector quantities.<p>We&#x27;re still in the land of a small number of parameters, but have gone from the three time-independent [mass, spin, charge] to eleven time-dependent [mass, spin, charge, 4-location, 4-linear momentum].<p>We can explode the number of parameters though by returning to &quot;what is charge?&quot;, and equipping these universes with fields of matter.  At this point one runs right into the question of: &quot;does the no-hair conjecture hold in a physically plausible universe surrounding a <i>theoretical</i> black hole?&quot; or almost equivalently &quot;when do <i>theoretical</i> black holes fail to approximate <i>astrophysical</i> black holes?&quot;, and Ligo&#x2F;Virgo are good laboratories for studying whether merging black holes go completely bald.<p>(The hair that is supposed to bald away may be soft and indirect: the circulation of gas and dust at a distance may reveal that a given black hole was previously more than one black hole.  After merger, none of that should make a difference to anything (including a 3rd black hole) falling into the balded merged black hole that the merged black hole was previously two black holes.  More critically, in the enormously distant future, the evaporation of the merged black hole should not reveal the number or types of objects that fell into it during its history, whether those are black holes or some neutral mix of standard model particles.  The Hawking radiation spectrum at any moment should depend <i>only</i> on the eleven parameters in the previous paragraph.  But maybe that still-outside dust and gas has memory that remains relevant arbitrarily far into the future.  Or maybe classical general relativity is wrong and rather than being crushed into a memoryless ultramicroscopic point, the ingested gas, dust and other black holes retain or at least reveal their individual identities even during evaporation).<p>Questions like these make black holes extremely interesting, I think.

            maybe more than that, but I‘d say various discoveries during the golden age of physics would be contenders. Quantum effects, SRT &amp; GRT, nuclear energy, among others. Black holes are just one interesting phenomenon of nature, albeit a pretty fundamental one.

            Thank you for asking for that, it motivated a few minutes of reading several short papers I likely otherwise never would have seen.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2106.15181" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2106.15181</a> is the preprint.<p>The authors&#x27; model rests on an asymptotically flat <i>incoming</i> Vaidya spacetime[1] equipped with a cosmic microwave background that dilutes away over time (like the real CMB) but without the worries of tracking the cosmological constant sufficiently near the black hole.<p>They unsurprisingly find that the energy budget from the background light that collides into the black hole in this model is an uninteresting part of the system&#x27;s extractable energy budget.  The real CMB has a low energy-density at all times when our universe has star-filled galaxies in it, and one would need a high boost to get significant power from it, or equivalently, one would have to gravitationally modify the energy-density locally.   (That boost could be found by an observer hovering just outside their model non-rotating black hole, or in a different model where (for example) where a black hole&#x27;s rotation can lead to an observer developing angular speeds approaching the speed of light; however there is no obvious way to transmit harvested power of this sort &quot;up&quot; to a Dyson sphere thanks to gravitational redshifting at least.  The authors admit that calculating an energy budget which relies upon black hole rotation is too hard, and move on).<p>Skipping over the accretion disk section, which I&#x27;ll return to, the authors also find that in the absence of angular momentum and, an incoming spherically symmetrical uncharged &quot;rain&quot; onto the black hole does generate significant outgoing radiation, which is also unsurprising.  This is after all essentially what the CMB is, just with a higher &quot;molecular weight&quot; than light.  Of course this particular rain is unphysical: our universe is populated by clouds of gas, and stars, which periodically -- not uniformly in time -- intersect black holes like the one in our galactic centre [2], causing occasional flares.   They do not spend much time describing an integral approach around this.  For what it&#x27;s worth most principled uses of the Vaiyda metric consider <i>outgoing</i> radiation as an easy proxy for Hawking radiation (or even more often for modelling the cooling of white dwarfs).  A massive incoming Vaiyda &quot;anti-shine&quot; has some interesting consequences or requirements for regions far from a black hole with lifetimes of more than a few million years!<p>The authors do not properly explain how they equip their model with a relativistic jet (they repeat an empirical luminosity relationship between astronomically observed jets accretion disks, but no causality is found in their model, and their model is different from &quot;real&quot; astrophysics) which is quite striking given their everywhere spherically-symmetric, exactly zero angular momentum, and exactly zero magnetic charge setting for for their CMB and Bondi accretion analyses.  Their Chou 2020 reference [3] underpinning their relativistic jets purports to describe a spacetime where the authors <i>break</i> this no-angular-momentum condition.  From that breaking they take spherical symmetry into axisymmetry, and with some addition of magnetic interactions, they arrive at an environment that might plausible host relativistic jets.  But they also suddenly introduce significant consequences of angular momentum and other nongravitational charges near their model black hole that are not accounted for in their CMB or Hawking analyses.  They do not explain how to reconcile their findings from two qualitatively different spacetimes, nor do they attempt an argument that the quantitative differences vanish &quot;below&quot; the altitude of the Dyson sphere.  (Do you have to make an axisymmetric Dyson swarm, where the equatorial collectors have a high orbital angular velocity?)<p>I think that the authors would have written a more interesting (and challenging) paper if they had chosen to explore the components of the energy budget of their Dyson-around-a-black-hole system using a gravitational and matter background that does not change from subsection to subsection.<p>That they didn&#x27;t raises two questions I think are large.<p>Firstly, <i>can</i> they get their §2.6 relativistic jets somehow without introducing both angular momentum and magnetic interactions?  (The formation of relativistic jets is a live area of current research).<p>Alternatively, can they find the heavy calculation lifting in other published work for their energy estimates from CMB-infall and infall-onto-accretion-structure physics?  Their Chou 2020 references at least shows that they are competent to do a wide search for papers which purport to do that kind of heavy lifting.   Their §2.3 already refers to other work in accretion disc physics that reasonably covers both extremes of angular momentum, but there&#x27;s a gap between the two which is likely interesting for relativistic jets that an be &quot;mined&quot; by their Dyson sphere, and closer to the spin parameters of known black hole candidates.<p>- --<p>[1] §2.4 could be much clearer about this, especially in light of the &quot;Kerr-Vaiyda&quot; metric they found in [4]; they consider a vanishingly small <i>a</i> parameter (sometimes implicitly) whenever they discuss their model black hole, and resile from the consequences of a significant nonzero spin, except briefly for the case of the maximum possible spin.  Perhaps they found it easiest to import the maths from [4]&#x27;s results accepting them as good especially in the limit where <i>a</i> vanishes, rather than sticking to a more widely used model -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vaidya_metric" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vaidya_metric</a>.

            Taking this one step further, you could build an immensely powerful bomb&#x2F;superweapon&#x2F;mega space engine. Cover the inside of the Dyson spheres with mirrors then fire a laser inside. The black hole provides the perfect source to ramp up the energy before you could unleash it in a (un)directed way.

            A perfect mirror is a materials challenge and potentially a fundamental physics challenge. In comparison we already know roughly how to do the math to figure out how far the surface of your sphere would need to be from the center of a sun or black hole in order to harvest energy (via whatever method) without collapsing, based on the strength of the materials at our disposal. Of course the materials we have might not be strong enough, but it&#x27;s possible to push the sphere out until we can build it without it collapsing (and then the issue is collecting enough raw material). And given that solar panels work fine on earth, a dyson sphere can only improve solar panel efficiency even if its surface has to be very very far away due to materials challenges.<p>In comparison, if you can&#x27;t get your mirror close enough to perfect, the whole idea doesn&#x27;t work - the laser will be absorbed or diffused too much by the mirror, or the mirror will be damaged from the energy, etc.

            They only suck in stuff that gets too close relative to their mass. They aren&#x27;t magical. If you have a planet and turn it into a black hole with the same mass - anybody on orbit around that planet will continue on their orbits like nothing changed.<p>For a meteor it makes no difference if gravity is coming from a planet or a black hole of the same mass. The only difference is that once you get very close - the gravity changes much quicker (because black hole is much smaller and denser than a planet) so you will be ripped apart.

            Black holes don&#x27;t suck anything in. They just have very strong gravity relative to their size. So just like a space probe would drop into the sun if it got too close, things can get into an inescapable orbit around a black hole. If you can build a Dyson sphere around a star you can build one around a black hole of a similar mass.

            &gt; So just like a space probe would drop into the sun if it got too close<p>The probability for this to happen is actually quite low, ie. it&#x27;s suprisingly hard to &quot;hit&quot; the sun. The reason is that unless you put the probe on a completely straight path to the sun (which is hard because the sun is so small in terms of its solid angle on the sky), it will have some angular momentum and probably spin around the sun and come right back (more or less).

            Exactly my thinking every time I read about them. It&#x27;s one idea thought up by one scientist. It&#x27;s so human of us to think some advanced race would build a giant capture device around a star... did anyone stop to ask that if a civilization could do that, they would likely already have technology that could (to our eyes) generate power out of thin air? Nope, caveman brain build big wall around star to get ALL power!

            There are other benefits.<p>The internal surface area of a sphere with radius 1AU has so much area that its unlikely any spacefaring civilization would ever spread to that many planets. It would be enough to have billions of versions of your civilization&#x2F;species with room to spare, AND have them all be able to communicate without light years of transmission delays, never mind time and cost of travel, and thus drift apart. Then, one has the opportunity to otherwise live in very similar circumstances as the planet one evolved on. Looking at our attraction to nature I would guess any species would think of this as a benefit, and would prefer it over terraforming faraway hostile environments or inhabiting cramped space cabins.<p>So yes, if you have the ability to make a Dyson sphere, I can very well imagine that you would.

            Yes. Also, conservation of energy is completely conjecture.<p>Personally I think it will ultimately prove out to not be true in all cases. I might sound like a heretic for saying this and would be berated in the scientific community for saying that, but in the past most laws that establish constraints eventually prove out to be only true under certain controlled environments.

            It&#x27;s also a boring claim in its generality. We already <i>think</i> that conservation of energy is not universally (for the lack of a better word) true: Big Bang. Obviously, there is no <i>before</i> of that event, so it&#x27;s a little tough to even speak about, but that&#x27;s to be expected: When such an important law of nature does not apply, you cannot expect all others to continue working.

            Depends on the cosmos.<p>Below energy means any nonzero of any component of the stress-energy tensor T.<p>In vacuum flat spacetime, Tmunu def. 0, so the energy at every point is 0, the total energy is 0, and the average energy density at every point is 0.<p>We can take this logic to several families of vacuum spacetime.<p>In the sort of steady-state universe discussed in the early 20th century there is some distribution of stress-energy, varying the energy at any given point, but total energy = const., average energy density = const.<p>The problem is when we start adjusting the number of points without altering the stress-energy.   Interiors of (e.g. Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi) black holes develop lots of new spacetime points, but most of those points have zero stress-energy.   Futures of expanding universes have lots of new spacetime points, and most of them have zero stress-energy.   Put the two of them together in a &quot;swiss cheese&quot; spacetime, (we can cast a clumping \Lambda-CDM cosmos as one of those, with galaxy clusters forming and ultimately collapsing into ginormous black holes, and extragalactic space evolving into exceptionally hard vacuum &quot;cheese&quot; surrounding these holes), and you have a recipe for a growing number of points in space which with no stress-energy in them.  For a sufficiently long-lived expanding swiss-cheese universe, what&#x27;s the average value in the components of the stress-energy tensor?  Zero.  Approaching future timelike infinity, good luck finding any non-zeros at all.<p>Weiss &amp; Baez have a nice but brief expansion upon the \nabla_mu \cdot T^munu = 0 point that Carroll at your link declined to explain :) under the &quot;Divergence and Integration&quot; heading at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.ucr.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;&#x2F;baez&#x2F;physics&#x2F;Relativity&#x2F;GR&#x2F;energy_gr.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.ucr.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;&#x2F;baez&#x2F;physics&#x2F;Relativity&#x2F;GR&#x2F;energy...</a><p>Like them I would not go into Noether&#x27;s (first) theorem in any detail in explaining this even to an audience with more familiarity with physical cosmology than Carroll had in mind, for the following reason.<p>Note that while Weiss &amp; Baez write that certain cases meet most of the conditions required for Noether&#x27;s theorem to hold, they do not say with specificity that in general dynamical spacetimes do not possess the conditions required by Noether&#x27;s theorem, as noted in her commentary about the non-independence of the Euler-Lagrange equations in her <i>second theorem</i> paper   E. Noether, Nachr. d. Konig. Gesellsch. d. Wiss. zu Gottingen, Math-phys. Klasse pp. 235–257 (1918).   In modern language the current j^mu_beta vanishes iff the divergence of \sqrt(-det g_munu)\cdot T^mu_beta = 0.  I can dig up some refs for this if you&#x27;re realllllllllly keen, although I&#x27;d probably have to start with parts of Katherine Brading &amp; Harvey Brown&#x27;s 2000s-era &quot;really, which symmetries?&quot; work.<p>I&#x27;d rather just say, hey, in reasonably realistic spacetimes we break all sorts of symmetries compared to popular classics, and even those broke one or more symmetries compared to flat spacetime, and among the consequences are that things you (in flat spacetime) think are scalars (e.g. energy) may demand to be treated as tensor contractions, and vectors (e.g. momentum) are often even worse.  These quantities should take on different names to avoid confusion.  And those are what you are conserving, approximately conserving, or not conserving.<p>Or, to the point, any practical definition of <i>energy</i> is spacetime-dependent and the spacetime of special relativity is just <i>one</i> of an infinite number of possible spacetimes, and the only one that in 3+1 dimensions is uncurved.<p>The bright side is that in Lorentzian (3+1) spacetimes, you always have at least an infinitesimal patch of flat spacetime around any point, and often an even larger patch of <i>effectively</i> flat spacetime, so we have still have the <i>local</i> conservation laws ancestors discovered.<p>In most parts of our universe, and everywhere on Earth, the radius of (Riemann tensor) curvature is large.  So one can talk with virtually perfect accuracy to many digits of precision about special-relativistic energies or momenta of particle colliding experiments (including natural &quot;experiments&quot; carried out in post-supernova&#x2F;post-white dwarf deflagration nebula), and use conservation laws to decide there must be some species of particle carrying away some seemingly-missing energy or momentum, even though one can use atomic clocks or Pound-Rebka devices to measure the actual nonflatness of the patch of spacetime the collider building is in, or observe with spectroscopy and interferometry manifestly general-relativistic effects around the stellar remnants.  All of that is relevant if one is hunting axions, for example, where one will benefit from local Lorentz invariance and the conservation laws that flow from that.<p>This is a little important in the face of people misunderstanding &quot;energy is not conserved in general relativity&quot; as permitting EmDrive-type nonsense.<p>And finally, recalling my first line, in classical General Relativity we can define cosmologies for curved spacetimes with arbitrary integer numbers of dimensions greater than 1 such that non-conservative extra functions (encoding  a &quot;friction&quot; dissipative coupling between a metric and stress-energy, for instance; people have actually done this in bi-metric gravity for inflation reasons, and so have &quot;neo-(quasi-)steady-state-universe&quot; people) must accompany the Lagrangian.   This accompaniment is incompatible with Noether&#x27;s (first) theorem, even locally, except where (and if) the dissipative force has decayed away.

            Conservation of energy is not a separate rule. It&#x27;s a direct mathematical consequence of laws of the universe not changing as time goes by. Read about Noether theorem.

            You are late to the game and behind scientific community.<p>Physicists knows the exact reason why energy is conserved and why it might  not be conserved. Conserved quantities  arise from symmetries in variational systems. Conservation laws are consequence, not unexplained axiomatic law.

            No, they don&#x27;t &quot;know&quot;.<p>Those symmetries are not shown to be universally true, they are just what we have been able to observe, much like Newton&#x27;s laws are based on observations on the Earth only.<p>Yet Einstein showed that they are only a special case of a much more general universe.

            True.<p>We are essentially searching for civilizations that have no other forms of energy (from a star) and have to rely on Dyson spheres for their energy.<p>We are excluding all those civilizations that have successfully used a combination of solar, wind, fission &amp; fusion energy to drive their society.<p>I strongly believe that no matter what civilization, no matter how they look, what they consume or what they are made of, the core tenet of &quot;human psychology&quot;, or more correctly &quot;conscious being psychology&quot; would evolve in the same way as is for us.<p>If, let us say, we solve our energy issues, and we have built ourselves a world that is sustainable. Would we think about building dyson spheres? No, because there is only so much you can do with energy. You need materials, ores, deposits, etc to actually build something new.<p>I guess the most advanced civilizations would harness the power of the stars, fusion, and build themselves sustainable habitats that can be floated into the eons.

            I&#x27;d say that a Dyson sphere is the ultimate form of harvesting solar energy, like, <i>all</i> of it.<p>It should also be considered a successful form of fusion energy capture, using the star as a gravity-contained reactor.<p>A Dyson sphere makes sense when your home planet is not enough by far, and even all the planets in your system are not enough.

            &gt; No, because there is only so much you can do with energy. You need materials, ores, deposits, etc to actually build something new.<p>If you had the power of a star you could create all of that from base elements via eatting the star, and you&#x27;d barely make a dint in it&#x27;s mass.

            Reading the abstract, they didn&#x27;t mention which sources ended up making more power, but I&#x27;d guess that  (iii) an accretion disk, and (vi) relativistic jets are biggest.<p>However, my first thought is wouldn&#x27;t the Dyson sphere itself get in the way of the accretion disk?<p>Stars are generating energy by fusing previously accreted mass. But black holes need new mass to accrete and accelerate to add energy.  It seems a hapless incoming star about to get spread into accretion disk material might do some serious damage to the Dyson sphere?

            Yawn. Way more efficient&#x2F; easier to tap energy to build this around a main sequence star. Wouldn’t want to have to deal with a relativistic jet piercing my Dyson sphere or with the hard X-rays from accretion&#x2F;the jet.

            A well done data-driven thought experiment, but I do have to ponder why the scientific community has settled on Dyson Spheres, as opposed to more exotic, &quot;alien&quot; ideas. I mean, do we really think a thirty-five million year old civilization is going to settle on an idea some simian came up with in a civilization ~150 years post-harnessing electricity, which amounts to &quot;really big solar panels?&quot;<p>I&#x27;d speculate that power sources used by such civilizations would be so exotic to us, we would need new physics to fully describe them.<p>Also consider that the electromagnetic force is on the order of 10^36 times stronger than gravity. The electromagnetic force is what keeps your butt from falling through your chair, and gives all materials their macroscopic and chemical properties. And it sort of sets a soft limit on the sizes of rigid structures, animals, etc. Note that there are on the order of 10^30 atoms in a blue whale or Sequoia tree, and ~10^33 in a cargo ship.

            No one has settled on anything. It’s just that one approach involves solving a tractable problem to reduce the search space and the other does fuck all.<p>I’ve lost my keys, and these guys are asking me to retrace my steps while you’re asking me to consider the machinations of hitherto sleeping whimsical gods. I’ll try your thing next, but first I’ll do the other guys.
