This code pretty much implements a standard adversarial attack against NeuralHash. One slightly interesting part was replacing the thresholding with a differentiable approximation. I figured I&#x27;d share this here in case anyone is interested in seeing what the code to generate adversarial examples looks like; I don&#x27;t think anyone in the big thread on the topic (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AsuharietYgvar&#x2F;AppleNeuralHash2ONNX&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AsuharietYgvar&#x2F;AppleNeuralHash2ONNX&#x2F;issue...</a>) has shared attack code for NeuralHash in particular yet.

            Nicely done.  Thank you for sharing.<p>I&#x27;d like to share the following paper for anyone else who may be interested.  It is about watermarking rather than a preimage attack.<p>&quot;Adversarial Embedding: A robust and elusive Steganography and Watermarking technique&quot;  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1912.01487" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1912.01487</a><p>Unfortunately, the existence of invisible watermarking demonstrates a separate attack on the hash.  Instead of a preimage attack, this might be able to change the hash of an image that is suspected of already being a match.  A true-positive would be changed into a false-negative.

            The integrity of this entire system now relies on the security of the CSAM hash database, which has just dramatically increased in value to potential attackers.<p>All it would take now, is for one CSAM hash to be known to the public, then uploading collided iPhone wallpapers to wallpaper download sites. That many false positives will overload whatever administrative capacity there is to review reports in a matter of days.

            There&#x27;s no need for someone to get the entire CSAM database. If they go on the darknet and just find enough images (or hashes) that would trip Apple&#x27;s system, that would be enough. I&#x27;d assume any publicly available image on the darknet would likely also be on CSAM.

            Exactly. It would be trivial for anyone to compile a list of possible known CSAM hashes. It would be illegal to do so, but only one person has to do it, and then the list of probably positive hashes can be distributed legally around the web.

            Human doesn&#x27;t need to see the material. One can automate this by crawling websites with known bad material and compute hash of all images. Surely some of those hashes are CSAM, we don&#x27;t know which. But it&#x27;s still equally dangerous.

            No, there’s another private hash function that also has to match the known CSAM image for an image to be considered a match.<p>That one can’t be figured out through this technique.

            But surely if they&#x27;re doing this in anticipation of E2EE user data, that procedure becomes moot?<p>So either they have no intention to actually protect user data, or the system is trivially broken; either way a pretty damning look for Apple.

            No, because the second hash is only performed after the first hash has already matched, and so, using the threshold secret sharing crypto, the server has learned the escrowed encryption key for the image.  (Well, for its “visual derivative”, at any rate.)

            To assume CP is reviewed manually is simply wrong. You don&#x27;t want to put such weight on an individual. You want to automate it as much as possible, with as little false positives (and false negatives) as possible.<p>For example, in case of a wallpaper, let&#x27;s say its the Windows XP wallpaper. There&#x27;s no human skin color in it at all, so you can easily be reasonably sure it isn&#x27;t CP. You would not need an advanced ML for such.<p>And they can have multiple checksums, just like a tarball or package or whatever can have an CRC32, MD5, and SHA512. Just because one of these matches, doesn&#x27;t mean the other don&#x27;t. Only problem is keeping these DBs of hashes secret. But that could very well be a reason the scanning isn&#x27;t done locally.

            A lot has been said about using this as an attack vector by possibly poisoning a victims iPhone with an image that matches a CSAM hash.<p>But could this not also be used to circumvent the CSAM scanning by converting images that are in the CSAM database to visually similar images that won&#x27;t match the hash anymore? That would effectively defeat the CSAM scanning Apple and others are trying to put into place completely and render the system moot.<p>One could argue that these spoofed images could also be added to the CSAM database, but what if you spoof them to have hashes of extremely common images (like common memes)?

1. Can&#x27;t be reliably used to track actual criminal offenders (they&#x27;d just be able to hide) without rendering the whole database useless.

            That would be more effective! But that&#x27;s not something Apple is trying to solve here (or could ever solve).<p>They are trying to prevent CSAM images from being stored and distributed using Apple products. If that goal is easily circumvented, the whole motivation for this (anti-)feature becomes invalid.<p>I a way, this architecture could potentially even make Apple products more attractive for CSAM distributors, since they now have a known way to fly under the radar (something that is arguably harder&#x2F;riskier on other image sharing platforms, where the matching happens server-side).<p>One reasonable strategy Apple could have against that is through constantly finetuning the NeuralHash algorithm to hopefully catch more and more offenders.

            &gt; They are trying to prevent CSAM images from being stored and distributed using Apple products.<p>If what Apple is aiming for is a more complete version of E2EE on their servers, maybe that&#x27;s just an unintended consequence of the implementation, and the very reason why they&#x27;re surprised that this received so much pushback. If Apple wanted to offer encryption for all user files in iCloud and leave no capability to decrypt the files themselves, they&#x27;d still need to be able to detect CSAM to protect themselves from liability. In that case, scanning on the device would be the only way to make it work.<p>If that were the case, I still wouldn&#x27;t believe that moving the scan to the device fundamentally changes anything. Apple has to conduct a scan regardless, or they&#x27;ll become a viable option for criminals to store CSAM. But in Apple&#x27;s view, their implementation would mean they&#x27;d likely be the first cloud company that could claim to have zero knowledge of the data on on their servers while still satisfying the demands of the law.<p>Supposing that&#x27;s the case, maybe what it would demonstrate is that no matter how you slice it, trying to offer a fully encrypted, no-knowledge solution for storing user data is fundamentally incompatible with societal demands.<p>But since Apple didn&#x27;t provide such an explanation, we can only guess what their strategy is. They could have done a lot better job at describing their motivations, instead of hoping that the forces of public sentiment would allow it to pass like all the other scanning mechanisms actually had in the past.

            Allegedly other image sharing services already do CSAM detection after the upload. Switching handset OS removes any image-level defensive capability the abusers may employ, so they might face a higher risk using these other services.

            In addition to the attacks, such as converting legit image to be detected as CSAM (false positive) or circumventing detection of the real CSAM image (false negative), which have been widely discussed in HN, I think this can also be used to mount a DOS attack or to censor any images.<p>It works like this. First, found your target images, which are either widely available like internet memes for DOS attack or images you want to censor. Then, compute their Neuralhash. Next, use the hash collision tool to turn real CSAM images to have the same NeuralHash as the target images.  Finally, report these adversarial CSAM images to the government. The result is that the attackers would successfully add the targeted NeuralHash into the CSAM database. And people who store these legit image will then be flagged.

            I&#x27;m fairly sure they do, actually. It was in one of the articles earlier today that Apple has a distinct, secret algorithm they perform on suspected CSAM server side after it gets flagged by the client side neural hash. Then only after 30 such images from a single user are identified as CSAM by both algorithms will they be sent to a human reviewer who will confirm their contents. Then, finally, law enforcement will be alerted.<p>There has been a lot of hyperbole going around and the original premise that this is a breach of privacy is still true, but in my opinion the actual repercussions of attacks and collisions are being grossly exaggerated. One would have to create a collision with known CSAM for both algorithms (one of which is secret) which also overlaps with a legal porn image that could be misconstrued as CSAM by a human reviewer, or at the very least create and distribute hundreds of double collisions to DOS the reviewers.

            Given that training the same network (with the same structure) will result in different weights and different hashes with high probability, I would argue that the weights actually have all the important properties of a secret key.
You would just need to treat them as one operationally, i.e., make sure as few people as possible have access, and use truly random instead of pseudorandom numbers during training.

            There&#x27;s a massive difference. In fact, the data describing the trained model is not at all analogous to a cryptographic key.<p>A cryptographic key is a piece of information which, as long as it remains secret, should be sufficient to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your system. This means that your system should remain secure even if your adversary knows everything else apart from the key, including the details of the algorithm you use, the hardware you have, and even all your previous plaintexts and ciphertexts (inputs and outputs). If the key fails to have this property, your cryptosystem is broken.<p>The trained model (or the weights of a NN) does not have this property at all.  Keeping the model secret does not ensure the confidentiality or integrity of the system. E.g. just knowing some inputs and outputs of the secret model allows you to train your own classifier which behaves similarly enough to let you find perceptual hash collisions. If you treat your model as a cryptosystem, this would be a known-plaintext attack: any system vulnerable to these is considered completely and utterly broken.<p>You&#x27;d have to keep all of the following secret: the model, all its inputs, all its outputs. If you manage to do that, this might be secure. Might. But probably not. See also Part 2 of my FAQ, which happens to cover this question.

            To me the most interesting findings from this fiasco were:<p>1. People actually do use generally publicly available services to store and distribute CP (as suggested by the amount of reports done by Facebook)<p>2. A lot of people evidently use iCloud Photo Library to store images of things other than pictures they took themselves. This is not really surprising, I&#x27;ve learned that the answer of &quot;does anybody ever?&quot; questions is aways &quot;yes&quot;. It is a bit weird though since the photo library is terrible for this use case.

A lot of people evidently use iCloud Photo Library to store images of things other than pictures they took themselves<p>Not in the context of CSAM, but this is iOS’s “appliance” user interface coming back to bite it. The iOS photos app doesn’t appear to have a way to show the user <i>only</i> the photos they took.<p>Apps like Twitter, browsers, chat apps, screenshots all get to save their photos in the photo library. I believe iOS 15 has a way to filter photos by originating app, but for most users currently, it’s hard <i>not</i> to use iCloud Photo Library for photos I didn’t take myself.<p>Interestingly, users save chat history <i>including images</i>, from apps like iMessage and WhatsApp, on iCloud too.

            Before Files I&#x27;ve never actually saved any pictures and painstakingly routinely deleted screenshots.<p>The first is now a bit easier since the share sheet also has &quot;save to files&quot; (only some of the time though, for no apparent reason).

            Despite that Apple scanning our images is
a horrible privacy practice, I don&#x27;t get why
𝚜̶𝚘̶ ̶𝚖̶𝚊̶𝚗̶𝚢̶ some people think this is an ineffective idea.<p>Surely you can easily fabricate innocent images
whose NeuralHash matches the database.
But in what way are you going to send them to <i>victims</i>
and convince them to save them to their photo library?
The moment you send it via WhatsApp FB will stop you
because (they think) it is a problematic image.
And Even if the image did land, it has to look like
some cats and dogs or the receiver will just ignore.
(Even worse, the receiver may report you.)
And even if your image does look like cats and dogs,
it has to pass another automatic test at the server side
that uses another obfuscated, constantly-updating algorithm.
After that, even more tests if Apple really wants to.<p>That means your image needs to <i>collide</i> ≥ three times,
one open, one obfuscated, and one Turing.<p>Gmail scans your attachments and
most people are cool with it.
I highly doubt that Apple has any reason to withdraw this.

            It&#x27;s a good question, and unfortunately you&#x27;re probably right.<p>It boils down to this: If you can prevent [some organisation] from potentially destroying civilisation, how much effort would be too much effort, and how much uncertainty is too much uncertainty?<p>For most, there&#x27;s a trade off. If someone believes that the technology is sufficient for any country to implement a brutal civil rights destruction campaign, and that this is 50% likely, and all you need to do is upload some harmless images to your icloud to thwart it, why wouldn&#x27;t you? For example, maybe a certain political party could regain power in a massive way and start doing away with gay rights, locking up anyone with pictures of men kissing each other on their phones. Of course, other countries have other types of extremists that look like they might take over government, or have already taken over governments. In those countries, tools like this are already in place, and this new one could be very powerful.<p>So if you could upload some innocuous images and save hundreds of lives in 20 or more countries in the world, even if you don&#x27;t fear for your own country, would you?<p>Assuming you said yes, the question is, could everyone who agrees give Apple enough false positives, force enough human moderators to have to inspect the images, that the whole scheme becomes financially un-viable on Apple&#x27;s end?<p>Of course, the only thing we could do here is slow this &quot;progress&quot; down. Maybe we can use that extra time to share the message that &quot;this kind of technology is not ok&quot; and that being naive about what this tech will be used for is almost guaranteed to kill more people than it saves.<p>But while so few people are thinking of it in these terms, or if everyone believes the attempt to be futile, it can&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s like anything - by the time people realise there&#x27;s a problem, it&#x27;s often too late to fix the problem.

Sure, why not.<p>But let me ask some questions,
because at this point I am not sure
if people want Apple&#x27;s system to be robust or jammable.
If our fear is that Apple will tune the system to
detect pictures of two men kissing,
wouldn&#x27;t an easily jammable system works in our favor
because we can DDoS it or threaten to do so anytime we want?

            It&#x27;s all theater. We need to stop talking about it and get trusted security researchers picked at random to be deployed to Apple for an audit. They sign an NDA, they work in a clean room with no way to exfiltrate data, they get full access to all the algorithms, source code, trained networks, all test data, access to Apples infra to test as they please, etc. And then they need to be the definitive authority on this matter to give us info and suggestions.

            Cynical speculation:<p>Apple have decided their position of not being able to provide access to law enforcement is becoming a liability. They&#x27;re probably under intense pressure from several governments on that front.<p>This is a way to intentionally let their hand be forced into  scanning for arbitrary hashes on devices at the behest of governments, taking pressure off Apple and easing their relations with governments. They take a PR hit now, but it&#x27;s not too bad since it&#x27;s ostensibly about fighting child abuse, and Apple&#x27;s heart is clearly in the right place. When later, inevitably, the hashes start to include other material, Apple can say their hands are tied on the matter - they can no longer use the &quot;can&#x27;t do it&quot; defense and are forced to comply. This is much simpler than having to fight about it all the time.

            I agree CSAM isn&#x27;t likely to be pervasive in the photo libraries on iOS devices.<p>Android does not do on-device scanning, but Google does scan photos after they are uploaded to their cloud photo service. It&#x27;s not on-device scanning, but the effect is functionally identical: photos that are being uploaded to the cloud are being scanned for CSAM. The only real distinction is who owns the CPU which computes the hash.<p>I doubt it&#x27;s the FBI pressuring Apple. My suspicion is it&#x27;s fear of the US Congress passing worse, even more privacy-invading laws under the guise of combating CSAM. If Apple&#x27;s lobbyists can show that iPhones are already searching for CSAM, arguments for such laws get weaker.

            CSAM can never be a policy issue with two sides, because everyone is in agreement that we need to protect children. The higher powers want to prevent child abuse, and CSAM is directly tied to child abuse. When people argue that &quot;think of the children&quot; can be weaponized to attack their freedoms, they wouldn&#x27;t dare try to argue against the premise that children are harmed because of CSAM - not because the arguments will fall on the deaf ears of some governmental agents trying to push an agenda, but because the premise itself is sound.<p>As a result, people will focus their arguments instead on the technological flaws in the current implementation of on-device scanning or slippery slope arguments that are unlikely to become reality, the feature will be added anyway with no political opposition, and in the end Apple and&#x2F;or the government will get what they want, for what they consider the greater good.<p>I think that absolute privacy in society as a whole isn&#x27;t attainable with those values in place, and it raises many questions regarding to what extent the Internet should remain free from moderation. Are there really no kinds of information that are so fundamentally damaging that they should not be allowed to exist on someone&#x27;s hard drive? If not, who will be in control of moderating that information? Maybe we will have to accept that some tradeoffs between privacy and stability need to be made for the collective good, in limited circumstances.

            We do know that Apple has been scanning email attachments sent via iCloud email. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever been claimed that Apple has ever scanned anyone&#x27;s iCloud Photo Library.<p>Ethics aside, on-device scanning has the benefit of Constitutional protection, at least in the USA. Because the searching is being performed on private property, any attempt by the Government to try to expand the scope of searches would be a clear-cut 4th Amendment violation.<p>(Whereas if the scanning is done in the cloud, Government can compel searches and that would fall under the &quot;third party doctrine&quot; which is an end-run around the 4th Amendment.)

            Why not? Facebook and Twitter have done exactly that in the past year. Why is it far fetched for Apple suddenly, given this amazing reverse-course on branding?<p>The only realistic alternative to Apple is Android... And Google is pretty darn transparent in their spying on users. Apple just did a 180 degree about-face on all the branding they&#x27;ve built over the last decade. Why should anyone trust Apple again?<p>Look, this whole neural-hash thing took what, 2 weeks for people to fabricate collisions? This just illustrated how poorly conceived and ill-thought the entire plan was from Apple. It&#x27;s not beyond reason to assume any of these things given the evidence we currently have.

            &gt; I agree CSAM isn&#x27;t likely to be pervasive in the photo libraries on iOS devices.<p>Where does this assumption come from? Because of iOS lower market share? Are you implying they are more prevalent in Android devices? In desktop computers? I don&#x27;t understand the logic.

            The assumption comes from a general observation that most normal people don&#x27;t tend to use their photo library to store legal porn (other than home made) and I haven&#x27;t seen any argument for why CSAM aficionados are expected to be any less careful. There are surely plenty of apps out there for keeping separately encrypted vaults of files&#x2F;photos, and I&#x27;m sure many are very easy to use.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be particularly tech savvy to know it&#x27;s a bad idea to co-mingle your deepest darkest secrets alongside photos of your mum and last night&#x27;s dinner. Especially when discovering those secrets would lead to estrangement, or prison.<p>As for the few who might be doing it currently, that&#x27;s likely to plummet quickly. If you think Apple&#x27;s move caused waves in the Hacker News crowd, just imagine how much it has blown up in the CSAM community right now. I dare say it&#x27;s probably all they&#x27;ve been talking about for the past two weeks.

            Apple is scanning files locally before they are uploaded to iCloud in order to avoid storing unencrypted photos within iCloud but still discovering CSAM.

            Apple has outlined[1] multiple levels of protection in place for this:<p>1. You have to reach a threshold of matches before your account is flagged.<p>2. Once the threshold is reached, the matched images are checked against a different perceptual hash algorithm on Apple servers. This means an adversarial image would have to trigger a collision on two distinct hashing algorithms.<p>3. If both hash algorithms show a match, then “visual derivative” (low-res versions) of the images are inspected by Apple to confirm they are CSAM.<p>Only after these three criteria are met is your account disabled and referred to NCMEC. NCMEC will then do their own review of the flagged images and refer to law enforcement if necessary.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Security_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Security_Threat_Model...</a>

            NeuralHash collisions are interesting, but the way Apple is implementing their scanner it&#x27;s impossible to extract the banned hashes directly from the local database.<p>There are other ways to guess what the hashes are, but I can&#x27;t think of legal ones.<p>&gt; Matching-Database Setup. The system begins by setting up the matching database using the known CSAM image hashes provided by NCMEC and other child-safety organizations. First, Apple receives the  NeuralHashes corresponding to known CSAM from the above child-safety organizations. Next, these 
NeuralHashes go through a series of transformations that includes a final blinding step, powered by elliptic curve cryptography. The blinding is done using a server-side blinding secret, known only to Apple. The  blinded CSAM hashes are placed in a hash table, where the position in the hash table is purely a function of the NeuralHash of the CSAM image. This blinded database is securely stored on users’ devices. The properties of elliptic curve cryptography ensure that no device can infer anything about the underlying CSAM image hashes from the blinded database.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;CSAM_Detection_Techni...</a>

            You can extract the hashes with a few hours spent on the darknet. Doing that is certainly illegal and not to mention VERY morally wrong, but criminals exist and criminals won&#x27;t hesitate to abuse this as a mechanism for framing, extortion, or ransom.<p>It&#x27;s also possible for someone (Attacker A) to go on the darknet and get a list of 96-bit neural hashes, and then publish or sell this list somewhere to another party, Attacker B. The second party would never have to interact with CSAM.<p>Imagine Ransomware v2: We have inserted 29 photos of CSAM-matching material into your photo library. Pay X monero to this address in 30 minutes, or we will insert 2 additional photos, which will cross the threshold and may result in serious and life-changing consequences to you[1].<p>The difference here (versus the status quo) is that an easily-broken perceptual hashing enables the attacker to never send or possess any CSAM images[2]. From my experiences with being victims of various hackers, I know a lot of them won&#x27;t touch CSAM because they know it&#x27;s wrong, but they&#x27;ll salivate at an opportunity to weaponise automated CSAM scanning.<p>[1]: If you think Apple&#x27;s human review will mitigate this attack, you can permute legal pornography to match CSAM signatures. If Apple&#x27;s reviewers see 30 CSAM matches and the visual derivatives look like porn, they will be legally required to report to to NCMEC (a statutory quasi-government agency staffed by the FBI), even if all the photos are actually consensual adults.<p>[2]: If you never possess nor touch CSAM, it might be harder for you to get charged with CP charges. You might be looking at CFAA, blackmail or extortion charges; while your victim faces child pornography charges. This is basically an &quot;amplification attack&quot; on the real world judicial system.

            One of the grosser clean room designs.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible, but I posit that the exploit chain necessary to get the capability to inject photos onto an arbitrary user&#x27;s iPhone is valuable enough that it&#x27;s more likely to be used for spying by repressive regimes than straight up blackmail-- and if you had such a capability, why bother with hash-colliding permutations of legal pornography? Why not plant CSAM directly onto the user&#x27;s device?<p>Nearly all cloud storage services implement a scanner like this, and permit the same level of blackmail with a simpler attack chain, such as phishing Dropbox credentials to inject illegal material.<p>I think the more interesting attacks are governments colluding to add politically motivated non-CSAM material to the lists and then requiring Apple allow them to perform the human review to discover dissidents.

            If you plant CSAM, you must possess, distribute, and transmit CSAM. That creates moral and legal barriers. The median ransomware actor probably finds CSAM repulsive and wrong.<p>If you plant material that matches CSAM hashes, you do none of that.

            Yeah, it was very pointedly awkwardly worded. It’s intended for human reviewers to distinguish a false positive from a real positive. An eigen vector mapped image isn’t going to do that, a heavily Gaussian-blurred image isn’t going to do that - it needs to be something that a minimum wage person who’s only been trained a day or to can distinguish as “CSAM” or “not CSAM” and that means it’s a thumbnail of sorts.

            This attack does not work, as Apple uses two hashing algorithms, one on the device which is now public, and one which is secret. You would have to collide both, which would be hard enough if you knew what the second one was, which you don&#x27;t.

            To defeat this, all you need to be is a state actor with a database of child porn at your disposal (which is stored for exactly the purpose of training detection systems). Then you run the hashing algorithm against images you <i>know</i> are in the database (Apple suggested that they would accept suggestions by some kind of multi-Country vote). Then you can pull out the hashes and figure out how to trigger false positives on the important vectors.<p>Next, embed your images in sites of interest, like:<p>* A meme in some group<p>* A document or &#x27;leak&#x27;<p>* An email to a journalist<p>Wait for somebody to save it to their Apply device. Wait for it to be flagged and then use that as &#x27;reasonable means to conduct a search&#x27;. When asking for a warrant, the agency would say something like &quot;we detected possible CSAM on a device, the likelihood of a false match is extremely low&quot; - a judge will hardly press further.<p>You now essentially have a weapon where you can search <i>any</i> Apple device in the name of preventing the distribution of CSAM.<p>Failing that, you could just have `document_leak.pdf` and download a file that is <i>both</i> a valid PDF and a child porn image, depending on which program you open it with.

            There&#x27;s already a problem that Apple can&#x27;t verify the hashes. Say a government wants to investigate a certain set of people. Those people probably share specific memes and photos. Add those hashes to the list and now you have reasonable cause to investigate these people.<p>Honestly this even adds to the danger of hash collisions because now you can get someone on a terrorist watch list as well as the kiddy porn list.

            This doesn’t work for two reasons:
  1) There’s no way to know the perceptual hash value of Apple’s private NeuralHash function that is run on the derivative of the image server side to verify a hit really is CSAM. So while you could cause a collision with the on device neural hash if you possessed illegal content, you wouldn’t know if you successfully faked Apple’s private neuralhash implementation. 
2) An Apple reviewer must verify the image is illegal before it’s passed along to law enforcement.

            I doubt finding it would really be that hard, if you wanted to be on a list somewhere in some government database, but even armed with a full image that is in the NCMEC database, the problem is that the second hashing algorithm runs on the server and presumably has secure-by-obscurity details… so it would be hard to collide with it on purpose unless you are an insider. That’s my understanding, although details have been a bit shaky at times.

            Apparently the images in question would get sent to the server, and all calculation happens there.<p>&gt; In a call with reporters regarding the new findings, Apple said its CSAM-scanning system had been built with collisions in mind, given the known limitations of perceptual hashing algorithms. In particular, the company emphasized a secondary server-side hashing algorithm, separate from NeuralHash, the specifics of which are not public. If an image that produced a NeuralHash collision were flagged by the system, it would be checked against the secondary system and identified as an error before reaching human moderators.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;8&#x2F;18&#x2F;22630439&#x2F;apple-csam-neuralhash-collision-vulnerability-flaw-cryptography" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;8&#x2F;18&#x2F;22630439&#x2F;apple-csam-neura...</a><p>For one reason or another Apple <i>really</i> wants to create this precedent, so it’s only natural they’re doing every last thing to make the feature hard to defeat.

            Can&#x27;t they just make a new one and recompute the 2nd secret hash on the whole data set fairly easily?<p>Also, the whole point is that it&#x27;s fairly easy to create a fake image that collides with one hash, but doing it for 2 is exponentially harder. It&#x27;s hard to see how you could have an image that collides with both hashes (of the same image mind you).

            Two hash models is functionally equivalent to a particular type of one double-sized hash model. So it shouldn&#x27;t be any harder to recompute against a 2nd hash, if that 2nd hash were public.<p>Of course, it won&#x27;t be public (and if it ever became public they&#x27;d replace it with a different secret hash).

            You can still hack someone&#x27;s phone and upload actual CSAM images.  That exposes the attacker to additional charges, but they&#x27;re already facing extortion and all that anyway.

            It may not be,  so honestly I think my objection is best dismissed. Once I ran down the actual chain I mostly sorted things out with a cooler head.<p>However, the line of thinking was if Apple has a secondary classifier to run against visual derivatives, the intent is it can say &quot;CSAM&#x2F;Not CSAM&quot;. Since the NeuralHash can collide, that means they&#x27;d need something to take in the visual derivatives, and match it vs an NN trained on actual CSAM. Not hashes. Actual.<p>Evidence, as far as I&#x27;m aware, is admitted to the public record, and a link needs to exist, and be documented in a publically and auditable way. That to me implies any results of a NN would necessarily require that the initial training set be included for replicability if we were really out to maintain the full integrity of the chain of evidence that is used as justification for locking someone away. That means a snapshot of the actual training source material, which means large CSAM dump snapshots being stored for each case using Apple&#x27;s classifier as evidence. Even if you handwave the government being blessed to hold onto all that CSAM as fitting comfortably in the law enforcement action exclusions; it&#x27;s still littering digital storage somewhere with a lotta CSAM. Also Apple would have to update their model over time, which would require retraining, which would require sending that CSAM source material to somewhere other than NCMEC or the FBI (unless both those agencies now rent out ML training infrastructure for you to do your training on leveraging their legal carve out, and I&#x27;ve seen or come across no mention of that.)<p>Thereby, I feel that logistically speaking, someone is commiting an illegal act somewhere, but no one wants to rock the boat enough to figure it out, because it&#x27;s more important to catch pedophiles than muck about with blast craters created by legislation.<p>I need to go read the legislation more carefully, so just take my post as a grunt of frustration at how it seems like everyone just wants an excuse&#x2F;means to punish pedophiles, but no one seems to be making a fuss over the devil in the details, which should really be the core issue in this type of thing, because it&#x27;s always the parts nobody reads or bothers articulating that come back to haunt you in the end.

            Yeh I was talking in hyperbole, but the possible attack vectors this system enables are so powerful I felt it warranted. Under this system you are able to artificially ddos organizations that verify if CP is sent by sending legitimate, low-res porn whose hash has been modified. You can trigger legitimate investigations by sending CSAM through WhatsApp or through social engineering. You can also fuck with Apple by sending obvious spam.<p>* With regard to the legislative branch, they can even mandate changes to this system they aren&#x27;t allowed to disclose. Once this system is in place, what is stopping governments from forcing other sets of hashes for matching.

            And this is just one step away from Apple and Microsoft building this scanning into the OS itself (into the kernel&#x2F;filesystem code, why not?!). This is beyond insane. Stallman was right. Our devices aren&#x27;t ours anymore.<p>Now, to be fair, there would be a secondary private hash algorithm running on Apple&#x27;s servers to minimize the impact of hash collisions, but what&#x27;s important is that once a file matches a hash locally, the file isn&#x27;t yours anymore -- it will be uploaded unencrypted to Apple&#x27;s servers and examined.

            Jup. As others have pointed out, if Apple were willing to lie about the extent of this system and its inception date, why should we suddenly trust that they won&#x27;t extend its functionality. They themselves explicitly state that the program will be extended, so if this is the starting point I don&#x27;t think I will be around for the ride.<p>It&#x27;s a shame as I really love some of their privacy-minded features (e.g. precision of access to the phone&#x27;s sensors and&#x2F;or media).

            Of course they do.  If they didn&#x27;t, every seedy pedo would be in the process of making a &quot;report.&quot;  It&#x27;s probably also why Apple is using &#x27;visual derivatives&#x27; for confirmation, rather than the image, though I can&#x27;t find info on exactly how low resolution &#x27;visual derivatives&#x27; are.<p>It is of course possible that companies may get some special sign off from LE&#x2F;NCMEC to do this kind of work - I won&#x27;t argue with you on that as I truly don&#x27;t know.  I can just tell you my company did not, and was very harshly told how to proceed despite knowing the nature of what we were trying to accomplish.  But, we weren&#x27;t anywhere near Apple big.<p>I remember chatting with our legal team, who made it explicit that laws didn&#x27;t to cover carve outs - basically &#x27;seeing&#x27; was illegal.  But as you can imagine, police didn&#x27;t come busting down our doors for happening upon it and reporting it.  If you have links to law where this is not the case, I&#x27;ll gladly eat crow.  I&#x27;ve never looked myself and relied on what the lawyers had said.

            Counter-question: At what point is child porn actually child porn, socially and statistically speaking?<p>If I share that picture of my child with my friends and loved ones on Facebook - at what &quot;scale&quot; is it considered to be added to that database as child porn?<p>1k shares? 10k? Who&#x27;s the one eligible to decide that? The judicatives? I think this scenario is a constitutional crisis because there&#x27;s no good solution to it in terms of law and order.

            idk what&#x27;s in the database, whether it&#x27;s rape or nudes or both. Although depictions of sexual acts versus simple nudity seems like a logical place to draw a line, all the lines on <i>adult</i> pornography are arbitrarily drawn based on &quot;community standards&quot;, and we&#x27;re only a few decades away from state-level bans on <i>any</i> nudes as &quot;porn&quot; in the US, including artistic photos.

What a horrific, orwellian situation if someone sent you hash matches, the police raid your house and now you can&#x27;t even see what they think they have or prove your own innocence.

            A hash collision allows you to create material that matches CSAM signatures, without being CSAM.

            Sorry, this is not even wrong.<p>The visual derivative is just a resized, very-low-resolution version of the uploaded image. &quot;Matching the visual derivative&quot; is completely meaningless.

            I just want to be clear if I understand this... many images can result in the same hash, but the hash can and will be reversible into one image? And that image is a low res porn photo derived from the algorithm&#x27;s guesswork? So once a hash matches they <i>don&#x27;t</i> check if there was a collision and the photo is completely unrelated, they <i>just</i> see the CG porn?

            No, this is not what&#x27;s going on at all. The employees never see the original photos in the government CSAM hash database. Apple doesn&#x27;t even have these photos: it&#x27;s precisely the kind of content that they don&#x27;t want to store on their servers. If some conditions are satisfied, the employees gain access to the visual derivatives (low-resolution copies) of your photos, and they judge whether these look like they could plausibly be related to CSAM materials.<p>The exact details of the algorithm are not public, but based on the technical summary that Apple provided, it almost certainly goes something like this.<p>Your device generates a secret number X. This secret is split into multiple fragments using a sharing scheme. Your device uses this secret number every time you upload a photo to iCloud, as follows:<p>1. Your device hashes the photo using a (many-to-one, hence irreversible) perceptual hash.<p>2. Your device also generates a fixed-size low resolution version of your image (the &quot;visual derivative&quot;). The visual derivative is encrypted using the secret X.<p>3. Your device encrypts some of your personally identifying information (device ids, Apple account, phone number, etc.) using X.<p>4. The hash, the encrypted visual derivative, and the encrypted personally identifying information are combined into what Apple calls the &quot;safety voucher&quot;. A fragment of your key is attached to the safety voucher, and the voucher is sent to Apple over the internet. The safety vouchers are sent in a &quot;blinded&quot; way (with another encryption key derived using a Private Set Intersection scheme detailed in the technical summary), so that Apple cannot link them to specific files, devices or user accounts unless there&#x27;s a match.<p>5. Apple receives the safety voucher. If the hash in the received safety voucher matches that of known CSAM content in the government-provided hash database (as determined by the private set intersection scheme), the voucher is saved and stored by Apple, and the fragment of your secret key X is revealed and saved. (You&#x27;d assume that they filter out &#x2F; discard your voucher if there&#x27;s no match; but the technical summary doesn&#x27;t explicitly confirm this; this means that they may store and use it in the future to run further scans).<p>6. If your account uploads a large number of matching vouchers, then Apple will gather enough fragments to reassemble your entire secret key X. Now that they know your secret key, they can use it to decrypt the &quot;visual derivatives&quot; stored in all your saved vouchers.<p>7. An Apple employee will then inspect the &quot;visual derivatives&quot;, and if your photos look like CSAM (more precisely, this employee can&#x27;t rule out by visual inspection that your photos are CSAM-related), they will proceed to use your secret key X (which they now know) to decrypt the personally revealing information contained in your safety voucher, and report you to the authorities.<p>Keep in mind that the employee looking at the visual derivative does not, and cannot, know what the original image is supposed to look like. The only judgment they get to make is whether the low-resolution visual derivative of your photo looks like it can plausibly be CSAM-related or not. Plainly speaking, they will check if a small, say 48x48 pixel, thumbnail of your photo looks vaguely like naked people or not.

            That bit you quoted seems to be actually correct. It does not mention visual derivatives at all.<p>That said I think your statement is a bit too strong, but generally true. A hash collision is not going to inherently be visually confusing. However you claim that it is impossible for an image to be both visually confusing and a hash collision, which seems unlikely. The real question is going to be how much more effort it takes to do both.

            Most people wouldn&#x27;t of course. In this scenario you&#x27;d get someone to download the CSAM unknowingly. If they have iCloud sync it automatically uploads to iCloud, thereby triggering the system. At that point the authorities will be alerted by Apple, and you can inform media outlets. They in turn will ask law enforcement who will confirm the investigation, and the reputation of the person investigated will be tarnished.

            The sender would of course be charged with wasting police efforts, defamation attempts+++. In the case of false positives the receiver of course wouldn&#x27;t be charged, it&#x27;s more about the fact that this system can be manipulated with too much ease. Even if you&#x27;re not charged, an investigation takes time away from already limited law enforcement resources. I&#x27;m also not interested in buying products from a company that blatantly spies on me. Today it&#x27;s CSAM, but as others have pointed out, the hashes can be changed to look for anything.

            Well that depends on the situation. Regardless the sender would be charged if found, but if they were able to get legitimate CSAM on the receiver&#x27;s phone the receiver could possibly be charged too, or at least investigated. Just the idea of getting investigated in these kinds of attacks, much less being exposed publicly as being under investigation is a horrible thought.

            Photos in the database are classified for their content. Only images classified as A1 (A: prepubescent minor, 1: sex act) are being included in the hash set on iOS. So this doesn&#x27;t even include A2 (2: lascivious exhibition), B1 or B2 (B: pubescent minor) let alone images which are in the database and aren&#x27;t classified as any of A1, A2, B1 or B2.<p>While I&#x27;ve no doubt that there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;before and after&quot; images (which are still technically CSAM even if they&#x27;re not strictly child porn) and possibly many innocuous images, they would not have been flagged as &quot;A1&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s probably still a few images flagged as A1 which shouldn&#x27;t be in the database at all, but that number is going to be small. How many of these incorrectly flagged images are going to make their way into your photo library? One? Two?<p>You need 30 in order for your account to be flagged.

            I think it’s implausible that someone can become aware of 30 images which are miscategorised as A1 CSAM. How would this malicious entity discover them? What’s the likelihood that this random array of odd images could make it into a target‘s photo library?<p>And what’s the likelihood that a human reviewer will see these 30 odd images and press the “yep it’s CSAM” button?<p>More likely as soon as Apple’s human review sees these oddball images, they’re going to investigate, mark those hashes as invalid, then contact their upstream data supplier who will fix their data and now those implausible images are now useless.

            This where the &quot;fog of war&quot; kicks in. What with doors being busted down, police departments making press releases, etc. I can easily imagine that the victim could be prosecuted, convicted and sent away because no-one understood the subtlety that their legal porn was not in fact CSAM.

            The fog of war is largely in the realm of post-puberty minors, photos of which are not being included in Apple&#x27;s corpus of hashes. I find it difficult to believe that anyone could mistake or otherwise &quot;fog of war&quot; a photograph of an adult and a prepubescent minor.<p>And that&#x27;s assuming someone develops a hash collision which doesn&#x27;t substantially mangle the photograph like the example offered on Github.<p>Specifically, only images categorised as &quot;A1&quot; are being included in the hash set on iOS. The category definitions are:<p><pre><code>  A = prepubescent minor
  B = pubescent minor
  1 = sex act
  2 = &quot;lascivious exhibition&quot;

            I don&#x27;t really want to do the research, so I&#x27;ll take your word for it.<p>But by fog of war I was thinking more like the victim already has some sleazy (though marginally legal) stuff on their computer, or a search led to a find of pot in their house, or they lied to try and get out of the rap, or perhaps the FBI offered them a deal and they took it because they saw no way out, or perhaps they were simply an unlikable individual who the jury took a dislike to.<p>Basically that things are not always clear cut, and they come out of the wrong side of things, in a situation created by Apple&#x27;s surveillance.

            Even if I grant all of the above, I don&#x27;t see how any of that is impacted by the distinction between on-cloud scanning and on-device scanning of photos which are being uploaded to the cloud.<p>Surveillance is surveillance. It&#x27;s a bit more obnoxious that a CPU which I paid money for is being used to compute the hashes instead of some CPU in a server farm somewhere (which I indirectly paid for) but the outcome is the same. The risk of being SWAT-ed is the same.

            It would still be mentally draining to be accussed of CP. Can you imaging how terrified one would be if they see a warning message with a blurred sunset? I don&#x27;t know exactly how the system works but from Apple&#x27;s press release, it hides the image and gives a warning to the user. This would not go well on social media.

            Of course it will get better. But it&#x27;s not going to end at &quot;Hey, this photograph of a sunset is visually unchanged&quot; while now matching CSAM. That&#x27;s just not plausible.

            That’s not how the technology works. The files are never decrypted. Instead, if enough hashes match, a “visual derivative” is revealed. What a “visual derivative” is hasn’t been explained, but most people seem to think it’s a low-res version of the file.

            Some people seem to be confused why a hash collision of a cat and a dog matters. Here&#x27;s a potential attack: share (legal) NSFW pictures that are engineered to have a hash collision with CSAM to get someone else in trouble. The pictures are flagged as CSAM, and they also look suspicious to a human reviewer (maybe not enough context in the image to identify the subject&#x27;s age). To show that this can be done with real NSFW pictures, here is an example, using an NSFW image from a subreddit&#x27;s top posts of all time.<p>Here is the image (NSFW!): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.ibb.co&#x2F;Ct64Cnt&#x2F;nsfw.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.ibb.co&#x2F;Ct64Cnt&#x2F;nsfw.png</a><p>Hash: 59a34eabe31910abfb06f308

            Apple&#x27;s reviewers don&#x27;t have access to the original CSAM to know if it&#x27;s a match or not. That stays with NCMEC. If they see some legal porn that looks like it could be illegal, they&#x27;d likely flag it as a match.

            Roughly thirty images is the threshold for the system to activate, but would they need to review all thirty images to pass it on or would they just need to verify one image looks visually like CSAM in order to pass it along?<p>It seems unlikely in the event that there was anything that they verified as CSAM they wouldn&#x27;t pass it on just because they found a false positive in those thumbnails.

            Here in Denmark a 15-year old girl and boy was filmed while having sex, and the video spread around among teenagers, apparently mostly through Facebook Messenger.<p>In 2018, the police indicted 1000 of them (tracking them down with Facebook&#x27;s help). Legal results were a child-porn law judgement for 334 of them, and simpler penalties for 400.<p>The child-porn judgement was mostly suspended sentences, but it precludes working with children (as a teacher or even sports trainer if children under 15yo are involved) for between 10 and 20 years.<p>If there was a system that would have caught it sooner, prior to sharing, the spread would be minimized. The police took 3 years to form a plan to indict the 1000+ people.

            The adversarial images have to match both the NeuralHash output of CSAM, plus another private perceptual hash that points to the same image that only Apple has access to, plus a human reviewer needs to agree it is CSAM, and this has to happen for 30 images.

            Indeed, if they&#x27;re proposing to only decrypt select images the client needs to know pass&#x2F;fail at some point. Whether that&#x27;s before or after sending the hashes to Apple&#x27;s server really doesn&#x27;t matter as bulk checks will likely be a part of API anyways. We&#x27;ll have to wait for further reverse engineering to get full details here though.

            I&#x27;ve seen a lot of comments &quot;muddying the waters&quot; (intentionally or not) about whether hash colliders like the one demonstrated above can be used to carry out an attack. So I wrote up a quick FAQ addressing the most common points.<p>Part 1&#x2F;2<p><i>Q: I heard that Apple employees inspect a &quot;visual derivative&quot; of your photos before reporting you to the authorities. Doesn&#x27;t this mean that, even if you modify images so their hash matches CSAM, the visual derivative won’t match?</i><p>A: No. &quot;Matching the visual derivative&quot; is completely meaningless. The visual derivative of your photo cannot be matched against anything, and there is no such thing as an &quot;original&quot; visual derivative to match against. Let me elaborate.<p>The visual derivative is nothing more than a low resolution thumbnail of the photo that you uploaded. In this context, a &quot;derivative&quot; simply refers to a transformed, modfied or adapted version of your photo. So a &quot;visual derivative&quot; of your photo means simply a transformed version of your photo that still identifiably looks like the photo you uploaded to iCloud.<p>This thumbnail is never matched against known CSAM thumbnails. The thumbnail cannot be matched against known CSAM thumbnails, most importantly because Apple doesn&#x27;t possess a database of such thumbnails. Indeed, the whole point of this exercise is that Apple really doesn&#x27;t want to store CSAM on their servers!<p>Instead, an Apple employee looks at the thumbnails derived from your photos. The only judgment call this employee gets to make is whether it can be ruled out (based on the way the thumbnail looks) that your uploaded photo is CSAM-related. As long as the thumbnail contains a person, or something that looks like the depiction of a person (especially in a vaguely violent or vaguely sexual context, e.g. with nude skin or with injuries) they will not be able to rule out this possibility based on the thumbnail alone. You can try it yourself: consider three perfectly legal and work-safe thumbnails of a famous singer [1]. The singer is underage in precisely one of the three photos. Can you tell which one?<p>All in all, there is no &quot;matching&quot; of the visual derivatives. There is a visual inspection, which means that if you reach a certain threshold, a person will look at thumbnails of your photos. Given the ability to produce hash collisions, an adversary can easily generate photos that fail visual inspection. This can be accomplished straightforwardly by using perfectly legal violent or sexual material to produce the collision (e.g. most people would not suspect foul play if they got a photo of genitals from their Tinder date). But more sophisticated attacks [2] are also possible, especially since the computation of the visual derivative happens on the client, so it can and will be reverse engineered.<p><i>Q: I heard that there is a second hash function that Apple keeps secret. Isn&#x27;t it unlikely that an adversarial image would trigger a collision on two distinct hashing algorithms?</i><p>A: No, it&#x27;s not unlikely at all.<p>The term &quot;hash function&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. When people hear &quot;hash&quot;, they tend to think about cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA256 or BLAKE3. When two messages have the same hash value, we say that they collide. Fortunately, cryptographic hash functions have several good properties associated with them: for example, there is no known way to generate a message that yields a given predetermined hash value, no known way to find two different messages with the same hash value, and no known way to make a small change to a message without changing the corresponding hash value. These properties make cryptographic hash functions secure, trustworthy and collision-resistant even in the face of powerful adversaries. Generally, when you decide to use two unrelated cryptographic hash algorithms instead of one, you make finding a collision at least twice as difficult for the adversary.<p>However, the hash functions that Apple uses for identifying CSAM images are not &quot;cryptographic hash functions&quot; at all. They are &quot;perceptual hash functions&quot;. The purpose of a perceptual hash is the exact opposite of a cryptographic hash: two images that humans see&#x2F;hear&#x2F;perceive (hence the term perceptual) to be the same or similar should have the same perceptual hash. There is no known perceptual hash function that remains secure and trustworthy in any sense in the face of (even unsophisticated) adversaries. Most importantly, it is not guaranteed that using two unrelated perceptual hash functions makes finding collisions more difficult. In fact, in many contexts, these adversarial attacks tend to transfer: if they work against one model, they often work against other models as well [3].<p>To make matters worse, a second, secret hash function can be used only after the collision threshold has been passed (otherwise, it would have to be done on the device, but then it cannot be kept secret). Since the safety voucher is not linked directly to a full resolution photo, the second hashing has to be performed on the tiny &quot;visual derivative&quot;, which makes collisions all the more likely.<p>Apple&#x27;s second hash algorithm is kept secret (so much so that the whitepapers released by Apple do not claim and do not confirm its existence!). This means that we don&#x27;t know how well it works. We can&#x27;t even rule out the second hash algorithm being a trivial variation (or completely identical) to the first hash algorithm. Moreover, it&#x27;s unlikely that the second algorithm was trained on a completely different dataset than the first one (e.g. because there are not many such hash algorithms that work well; moreover, the database of known CSAM content is really quite small compared to the large datasets that good machine learning algorithms require, so testing is necessarily limited). This suggests that transfer attacks are likely to work.

            FAQ Part 2&#x2F;2<p><i>Q: If the second, secret hash algorithm is based on a neural network, can we think of its weights (coefficients) as some kind of secret key in the cryptographical sense?</i><p>A: Absolutely not. If (as many suspect) the second hash algorithm is also based on some feature-identifying neural network, then we can&#x27;t think of the weights as a key that (when kept secret) protects the confidentiality and integrity of the system.<p>Due to the way perceptual hashing algorithms work, having access to the outputs of the algorithm is sufficient to train a high-fidelity &quot;clone&quot; that allows you to generate perfect adversarial examples, even if the weights of the clone are completely different from the secret weights of the original network.<p>If you have access to both the inputs and the outputs, you can do much more: by choosing them carefully [4], you can eventually leak the actual secret weights of the network. Any of these attack can be executed by an Apple employee, even one who has no privileged access to the actual secret weights.<p>Even if you have proof positive that nobody could have accessed the secret weights directly, the entire key might have been leaked anyway! Thus, keeping the weights secret from unauthorized parties does not suffice to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the system, which means that we cannot think of the weights as a kind of secret key in the cryptographical sense.<p><i>Q: I heard that it&#x27;s impossible to determine Apple&#x27;s CSAM image hashes from the database on the device. Doesn&#x27;t this make a hash attack impossible?</i><p>A: No. The scheme used by Apple (sketched in the technical summary [6]) ensures that the device doesn&#x27;t _learn_ the result of the match purely from the interaction with server, and that the server doesn&#x27;t learn information about images whose hash the server doesn&#x27;t know. The claim that it&#x27;s &quot;impossible to determine Apple&#x27;s CSAM image hashes from the database on the device&quot; is a very misleading rephrasing of this, and not true.<p><i>Q: Doesn&#x27;t Apple claim that there is only a one in one trillion chance per year of incorrectly flagging a given account?</i><p>A: Apple does claim this, but experts on photo analysis technologies have been calling bullshit [8] on their claim since day one.<p>Moreover, even if the claimed rate was reasonable (which it isn&#x27;t), it was derived without adversarial assumptions, and using it is incredibly misleading in an adversarial context.<p>Let me explain through an example. Imagine that you play a game of craps against an online casino. The casino will throw a virtual six-sided die, secretly generated using Microsoft Excel&#x27;s random number generator. Your job is to predict the result. If you manage to predict the result 100 times in a row, you win and the casino will pay you $1000000000000 (one trillion dollars). If you fail to predict the result of a throw, you lose and pay the casion $1 (one dollar).<p>In an ordinary, non-adversarial context, the probability that you win the game is much less than one in one trillion, so this game is very safe for the casino. But this number, one in one trillion, is based on naive assumptions that are completely meaningless in adversarial context. If your adversary has a decent knowledge of mathematics at the high school level, the serial correlation in Excel&#x27;s generator comes into play,  and the relevant probability is no longer one in one trillion. It&#x27;s 1 in 216 instead! Whenfaced with a class of sophomore math majors, the casino will promptly go bankrupt.<p><i>Q: Aren&#x27;t these attacks ultimately detectable? Wouldn&#x27;t I be exonerated by the exculpatory evidence?</i><p>A: Maybe. IANAL. I wouldn&#x27;t want to take that risk. While matching hashes are probably not sufficient to convict you, and possibly not sufficent to take you into custody, but it&#x27;s more than sufficient to make you a suspect. Reasonable suspicion is enough to get a warrant, which means that your property may be searched, your computer equipment may be hauled away and subjected to forensic analysis, etc. It may be sufficient cause to separate you from your children. If you work with children, you&#x27;ll be fired for sure. It&#x27;ll take years to clear your name.<p>And if they do charge you, it will be in Apple&#x27;s best interest not to admit to any faults in their algorithm, and to make it as opaque to the court as possible. The same goes for NCMEC.<p><i>Q: Why should I trust you? Where can I find out more?</i><p>A: You should not trust me. You definitely shouldn&#x27;t trust the people defending Apple using the claims above. Read the EFF article [7] to learn more about the social dangers of this technology. Consult Apple&#x27;s Threat Model Summary [5], and the CSAM Detection Technical Summary [6]: these are biased sources, but they provide sketches of the algorithms and the key factors that influenced the current implementation. Read HackerFactor [8] for an independent expert perspective about the credibility of Apple&#x27;s claims.

            Apple began scanning for CSAM with Neuralhash. This allows you to turn an image into a specific neuralhash thus possibly triggering its (automatic) CSAM detection. Imagine if a picture of a cat could cause Apple to think you have CP on your device.

            No. They calculate a hash on the device, but they only do it as part of the iCloud upload. So whether the hashing happens on the device or on the server, the same images get hashed either way.

            Photos of your dog are not going to trigger it. Someone would need to engineer the 30 photos of your dog tweaked to hash to a particular value, and then convince you to save them to your device and then upload to iCloud. And then some portion&#x2F;abstraction of the dog photo would need to convince a reviewer they were looking at CSAM.<p>The more likely path to trouble is legal NSFW material that&#x27;s been engineered.

            I don&#x27;t see how this is fixable on their end.<p>Several people have suggested simply layering several different perceptual hash systems, with the assumption that it&#x27;s difficult to find a colliding image in all of them. This is pretty suspect - there&#x27;s a reason we hold a decades-long competition to select secure hash functions. Basically, a function can&#x27;t generally achieve cryptographic properties (like collision-resistance, or difficulty of preimage computation) without being specifically designed for it. By it&#x27;s nature, any perceptual hash function is trivially not collision resistant, and any set of neural models are highly unlikely to be preimage-resistant.<p>The really tough thing to swallow for me is the &quot;It was never supposed to be a cryptographic hash function! It was always going to be easy to make a collision!&quot; line. If this was such an obvious attack, why wasn&#x27;t it mentioned in any of the 6+ security analyses? Why wasn&#x27;t it mentioned as a risk in the threat model?

            &gt; First, as an additional safeguard, the visual derivatives themselves are matched to the known CSAM database by a second, independent perceptual hash. This independent hash is chosen to reject the unlikely possibility that the match threshold was exceeded due to non-CSAM images that were adversarially perturbed to cause false NeuralHash matches against the on-device encrypted CSAM database.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Security_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Security_Threat_Model...</a>

            And that hash function is kept private, so you can’t just iterate to find a match of both hashes.

            Correct, gradient descent attacks like this depend on being able to differentiate your hash function.

            Honestly missed this.<p>Is that security-through-obscurity? If the model and weights for the second hash function became public, then we could still construct a collision on both functions, right?

            It’s not security through obscurity. The implementation is not necessarily a secret; it’s the model configuration which can only be differentiated if known. Since part of the threat is adversarial embeddings, it’s perfectly fine to assume you can keep a private model confidential that adversaries can’t differentiate.

            What are trying to prove here? It takes a human not noticing that a glitchy image of cat is not the same as picture of dog, 30 times.<p>Yea collisions are technically, possible. Apple has accounted for that. What is your point?<p>Hashes are at the core of a lot of tech, and collisions are way easier and more likely to happen in those in many cases, but suddenly this is an issue for ya&#x27;ll?
