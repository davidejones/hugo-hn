            Yeah, WTF is wrong with that. It&#x27;s the job description.<p>Programmers are essentially a type of translator. They translate constraints expressed in human language to constraints expressed as computer language.<p>At the higher levels you have more say how exactly that happens in terms of system topology, but at that point you&#x27;re no longer just a programmer, but an architect.

            I called myself a systems analyst. We don&#x27;t use the term engineer in my country. It leads to conversations where I describe that a lot of my job is optimizing processes before I code them. This was a great article for the bulk of programmers that end up in business programming.

            I think it&#x27;s a bit different: there aren&#x27;t many barely-trained (or untrained) people drilling teeth, but there are plenty of untrained programmers out there.<p>However the &quot;software engineer&quot; title is also applied to a lot of untrained programmers, so I&#x27;m not saying that this term is analogous to &quot;dentist&quot; even if it should be.

            While I could agree with you, my fundamental disagreement rests on this: it is the practice that awards the title&#x2F;description not the certification&#x2F;training. I’m willing to submit the philosophical underpinnings of this argument but I believe even without that the statement above can stand on its own.

            Yes, but the advice he&#x27;s giving is not meant to optimize for the most perfect description of what you actually do. It&#x27;s meant to make what you do sound good in the eyes of people more concerned with making money than objectively and unambiguously describing things.

            &gt; You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with:  Many people already successfully employed as senior engineers cannot actually implement FizzBuzz.  Just read it and weep.  Key takeaway: you probably are good enough to work at that company you think you’re not good enough for.  They hire better mortals, but they still hire mortals.<p>As much as I want to believe this, I think the ability of developers separates itself in different “classes”. The senior devs who can’t complete a fizzbuzz are probably not the competition for the jobs I want.

            I think I just did last week. The interviewer asked me to explain SOLID. I could only remember the O and the L. All of these practices are deeply internalized but without having interviewed in a while, or even used English at work, the little speeches and buzzwords escaped me. Then he brought up REST. “What are important principles of REST?” Ummm, nounifaction? Uff.

            I fully sympathize and I had to mute my mic once so the interviewer doesn&#x27;t hear that I am searching for what SOLID stands for, and then I proceeded to explain each of the characters.<p>But to be fair... is that an actual technical interview?

            I&#x27;m sure it depends on your industry and location.<p>In silicon valley software companies (e.g. Google, FB, Twitter, Stripe, Airbnb, Uber, and all the smaller companies following the same interview &amp; career ladder playbook) a senior engineer or L5 is just someone with around 5+ years of experience. They might have a few more meetings and spend a bit more time working on design docs, planning, mentoring others, etc. compared to more junior engineers, but their primary job is still writing code. Even at higher levels like Staff and Principal engineers, less time might be spent writing code and more time in meetings, leading committees, approving the largest in scope design docs, etc. but there are so few of these people and the bar is so high to get there that they were at least at one time some of the strongest engineers at the company, and they still code sometimes even at this level. In the entire IC track at these companies, I suspect you&#x27;ll find approximately 0% of people that are so incompetent they are just unable to implement fizzbuzz. In the management track you&#x27;d find some, but even there I suspect quite a low percentage.<p>In other industries, maybe banking, large contractors, more old fashioned megacorps like the GE&#x27;s of the world, I think there might be more &quot;architect&quot; and other technical tracks that are allegedly still programmer IC tracks but where the senior folks are much further removed from programming and wouldn&#x27;t be able to implement fizzbuzz.

            I work with a bunch of senior engineers making 400-600k, I would say there isnt a huge difference between them and ones making 175k at a startup&#x2F;non tech business. The biggest thing is comfort with scale, and high scale thinking. But its nothing thats difficult, just something to learn. If anything, I have seen much higher proficiency at startups where delivering across the stack is critical. Really, the interview process is segmenting engineers in ways that dont correlate with job performance (though there definitely is some signal)

            The older I get the louder I shout at clouds.<p>&quot;Engineers are hired to create business value, not to program things&quot;<p>FFS. True enough, but it&#x27;s still claptrap. One quote from George Orwell really struck for me:  &quot;speaking the truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s why now when people ask me what I do, I say &quot;programmer&quot;, not &quot;software developer&quot;. Actually, I usually say &quot;computer programmer&quot;, because otherwise people  get confused and think it might be to do with programming videos. Like programming your video recorder was a job, or something.

            Mmm. I get the idea, but I think there’s a better way to describe this.<p>Programmers are in such high demand that it’s the opposite of a dirty word. What’s being described feels more like mid- or late-career advice where you might want to specialize to keep advancing. That can mean deep-diving a domain, like the post suggests. It can mean focusing in a category of comp sci, like distributed systems or ML. It can mean consulting. It can mean management. Etc.

            The bigger problem is the forced march of hobbyist programmers (who had to get this job just to pay the bills) into some corporate automata climbing up and down some ladder in the name of career. The only thing worse than a career is career advice, especially if given by a career programmer.<p>Enjoy being a programmer, from this you&#x27;d never have to retire. Enjoy the freedom; it shouldn’t be all about money and optimizing the optics of what you do, just to force some perspectives.

But at the same time, a company can hire a bunch of fresh engineering graduates to work a such a project and not every one of them needs a license.

            The thinking in Canada is that engineer brings with it liability for the work so programmers don&#x27;t use it here. It offends engineers if you use that word in your title. The only exception I&#x27;ve seen is electrical engineers that of course have a fair bit of coding. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen them really use it much in their programming job descriptions even though they wear the engineering ring.

            That&#x27;s more common than you think. A respectable company Thoughtworks hired this way and boot camped and mentored people well the first couple years of their careers. I always like looking at the code and working with projects from their teams. Communication, working nicely with others, humility and the soft skills help you build a network so that when you need help you don&#x27;t spin your wheels.<p>The bigO crowd will disagree but even the hard core comp sci types will go much further with real soft skills.

            The author of this blog post uses the words engineer and engineering way too haphazardly. In my opinion, calling yourself engineer, when you are not a registered one, is a disservice to the actual engineers (that have to pass technical and ethical exams)

            Conversely, engineers can be &quot;registered&quot; and relegated to other adjacent roles because their credentials have been eclipsed by their lack of meaningful experience, and their ideas are no better than the smart programmers in the room. So I do understand the haphazardness to a degree, anyone can engineer, but not everyone can be an engineer.

            &gt; If you really like the atmosphere at universities, that is cool.  Put a backpack on and you can walk into any building at any university in the United States any time you want.<p>I would not follow this advice if your really have no business being there. Most universities in the US are in fact private institutions and this would be considered trespassing if you are found out. You might have an easy time blending in, but if any faculty (not just police, at least at my institution) asks to see your school ID, you are required to produce it.

            When I wanted to work from the University of Toronto I got an &quot;Outside Researcher&quot; card that let me use their libraries and get access to all their papers too! It was the cheapest desk you could rent in Toronto. Something like $100 a year and it came with access to all of their journals. In person, only, but still. Top notch ROI.

            I don&#x27;t think this is really true? most schools I&#x27;m familiar with are &quot;open campuses&quot;. the public is free to walk around campus, visit the library, etc. during normal hours. restricted areas like dorms and labs with expensive equipment will be locked. as an outsider, I wouldn&#x27;t try to sit in on a six person seminar without talking to the professor, but I&#x27;m sure no one would notice or care if you sat in on a few large lectures.

            One thing I know some schools offer is, IIRC, auditing classes. I did this at UT a few years ago. You basically pay a filing fee and then can attend classes without enrolling. No credits or degree possibility AFAIK, but you get to learn.

            All of those people have relationships with people already on campus, and many of them are given IDs if they&#x27;re there long term. If you&#x27;re just some guy with a backpack who hangs around campus for no reason and no one know what you&#x27;re doing there, people are going to notice, at least where I&#x27;m from. YMMV
