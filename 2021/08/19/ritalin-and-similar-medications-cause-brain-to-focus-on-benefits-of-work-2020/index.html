            I&#x27;m not a scientist, so I might be missing some nuance, but it strikes me that the experiment could indicate a million other things that are not &quot;Ritalin causes the brain to focus on benefits of work rather than its costs&quot;.<p>For all I know it could mean the person gets to believe more in their capacity to do the hard tasks. Or it could mean that the person feels less distracted and more willing to engage. Or many other things... Am I missing something?

            I think your hypothesis about confidence in the last paragraph is right on the mark.<p>Iirc there were studies done trying to assess the same thing with regards to Adderall (aka amphetamine salts, which is used for adhd similarly to Ritalin). The researchers came to that exact same conclusion, that the drug didn’t actually make people smarter, but it gave them an illusion of being more capable, and they ended up performing better due to confidence.[0]<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0376871617302983" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S03768...</a>

            No, you&#x27;re absolutely right. Studies like this need to be taken with a grain of salt. Also, until it is replicated, we don&#x27;t know if there is anything happening here at all.

            The OP mentions Adderall but the cited study only evaluates Methylphenidate (Ritalin) and Sulpiride (Dogmatil).<p>Adderall and Ritalin can be addictive and are widely abused. Many studies show that these drugs are relatively &#x27;safe&#x27;, but we are only beginning to understand the long-term effects on the brain from chronic abuse [2][3].<p>To anyone out there who is needlessly abusing these drugs, it would be prudent of you to look for alternative and natural ways to massage your mind into a state that is conducive to productive work. Exercise, diet, and sleep are incredibly important.<p><i>&gt; Higher dopamine synthesis capacity in the caudate nucleus was associated with greater willingness to allocate cognitive effort. In addition, methylphenidate and sulpiride increased subjective values and motivation to work specifically for people with low dopamine synthesis capacity. </i><p><i>&gt; Collectively, our results support that striatal dopamine enhances motivation for cognitive effort by amplifying the effects of benefits versus costs attended early in a decision. </i><p>[1] Dopamine promotes cognitive effort by biasing the benefits versus costs of cognitive work

            Honest question: do you have any credentials&#x2F;qualifications in the ADHD-neuroscience arena?<p>I ask because your sources don’t really serve your point, and are part of a broader body of literature that you’re not contextualizing: there’s a robust body of evidence, primarily based around MRI studies in real humans, showing that stimulant-based treatment of ADHD in childhood and adolescence does cause significant changes in brain structure. In a good way. Normalizing deficits in areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with executive function relative to controls.<p>I realize your comment itself is focused around abuse of these drugs rather than genuine treatment, but your citations don’t make much sense in that context, and there’s an *immense* body of research studying the long-term effects of amphetamine and MPH (especially amphetamine abuse). The assertion that we’re “just beginning” to understand this stuff is quite an overstatement.

            &gt; stimulant-based treatment of ADHD in childhood and adolescence does cause significant changes in brain structure. In a good way.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the literature showing evidence of reduced depression and suicide rates in adolescents who undergo long-term treatment with Ritalin and closely related drugs.<p>Are you aware of anything beyond that? Please cite the sources here so we can all learn. I have yet to see any conclusive evidence that the changes in brain structure and function are always &#x27;good&#x27;, and the previous citations I provided present evidence that counters your claim.

            No, but we’re definitely seeing the results of the first generation to be taking stimulants their whole life beginning in early childhood.<p>I was on amphetamines for ADHD for nearly 30 years. Toward the end it got really hard to tell the difference between “amped up and focused” and “active psychosis”. My behavior was erratic and people around me were worried, despite these being drugs I had taken my entire life. They worked well and helped me get to a certain point in my career where soft skills become more important, when they suddenly became a hindrance.<p>I switched to Strattera &#x2F; atomoxetine (a non-stimulant drug approved for use with ADHD) and it’s been great. I can’t rely on the drugs for motivation anymore, but it does seem to remove the roadblocks to focusing on something when I really need to.<p>I’m never going to have great attention to detail without amphetamines, and I’ve had to accept that and adopt a more “visionary” outlook. But I no longer feel like a square peg trying to force herself into a round hole. Amphetamines are good if your working style is to disappear into a hole and come out with a whole lot of productivity, but for anything collaborative I find they can be more of a burden than a boon.

            One of the weird aspects about Ritalin&#x2F;Adderall&#x2F;etc. treatment for attention deficit disorders is the repeated reports of folks who &quot;faked&quot; ADD to obtain the pills only discover they had actual ADD, and apparently they don&#x27;t experience the high that those without get from such stimulants.

            &gt; don&#x27;t experience the high that those without get from such stimulants<p>This is an urban legend doctors used to tell parents to get them ok with the idea of their kids taking stimulants. Amphetamines are “go pills”; they make you more productive in low doses and get you high in high doses whether you have ADHD or not.

            Hear, hear. This is practically a trope, and not just with ADHD but all kinds of illness, mental and physical. I&#x27;m not saying psychiatry or the pharmaceutical industry are perfect, or that there are zero people taking meds who don&#x27;t need to, but come on - there are actually lots and lots and lots of folks who have tried things like meditation and it didn&#x27;t make it possible for them to get through the day.<p>People with these kinds of problems reach a point of desperation after having tried everything you could possibly think of. So when the hundredth person comes along and says &quot;you don&#x27;t need meds, you just need X,&quot; where X is one of the <i>many, many</i> things they&#x27;ve already tried, it&#x27;s exasperating.

            Well it happened to me - I struggled with motivation, went for a diagnosis, got on the meds, got hooked, and have been dealing with the consequences ever since. There are many possibilities to explore and steps to take when one suffers from a lack of motivation, focus, or anhedonia. Diagnosis and treatment is not a silver bullet - there is no such thing as a magic pill. It can do wonders - for my one of my friends it is incredibly helpful, but she had already taken steps to deal with other issues. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong to add disclaimers in discussions like this - ADHD medication can change personality and cognition long-term.

            Despite these unfortunate feelings, it&#x27;s still valuable and actionable advice.<p>To me the key is changing the way I think about it - It&#x27;s not an illness, I&#x27;m different. It&#x27;s not a curse, I&#x27;ll figure out how to make it a blessing. I don&#x27;t need meds, I&#x27;ll work it out.

            &gt; The people who really need these and have tried everything else or struggled for years with ADHD really find the &quot;you are just going to be an addict, have you tried meditation&quot; approach patronizing.<p>Absolutely. It&#x27;s a really frustrating experience too when you&#x27;re denied access to these life-altering (not an exaggeration) medications for these reasons even when you have years of medical records detailing your condition and your treatment needs. I went to community college in a small town for the first two years of my degree; I had a great doc there who was happy to make sure I was getting the right doses for my condition and would check in with me every few weeks to see if anything had changed. After getting my associate&#x27;s, I moved to a much larger city to transfer to a college roughly 10x the size of my community college for my bachelor&#x27;s degree. I found a reputable local doc, got my medical records transferred, and made an appointment (required for a controlled substance) to continue my prescription.<p>You know what he told me?<p>&quot;Oh, since this is a college town with several colleges and a lot of students looking to abuse &#x27;study drugs&#x27;, our policy is that we don&#x27;t treat your condition here. But I have some resources on meditation and mindfulness that you should look through.&quot;<p>I got the same kind of answer at two other offices before I got fed up and asked my original doc to get me a referral to a psychiatrist who wouldn&#x27;t blow me off like these quacks had.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that substance abuse isn&#x27;t a problem, but I also don&#x27;t think that treating everybody like children and drug seekers is the right call. But hey, n=1 and I&#x27;m just some guy with a beard- YMMV.

            Really interesting. I&#x27;ve been on Adderall for almost 10 years and am constantly accused of being overly optimistic, which sounds a lot like the &quot;the brain to fix its attention on the benefits, rather than the costs, of completing difficult tasks.&quot; from the first paragraph.

            Are you being accused of optimism in hindsight or by naysayers in advance before attempting something? The answer matters. Sometimes accusations of optimism are a defense mechanism from lazy people. Or it could be good feedback that your projects are over-scoped.

            Interesting. But Devil&#x27;s Advocate here. Is this good news? This study seems to say that these drugs don&#x27;t change how you think (i.e., somehow improving the effectiveness of the thought process) but what to think about; what&#x27;s most important, or not.<p>Not to get a tin foil hat-y, but it easy to see a darkside to this, as well as there being those who would seek to exploit it.<p>But for therapeutic applications it sounds hopeful.

It’s not that I have trouble focusing; quite the opposite, I can focus for hours on the smallest detail. The problem is that without medication I don’t get to choose what that detail _is_. I could end up (and _have_ ended up) spending countless hours on inconsequential stuff because I can’t get it off my mind otherwise while I watch my life fall apart around me, unable to do a thing about it.

Their problem is a difficulty to <i>actively decide</i> to think in those terms when it truly matters, in practical day-to-day life. So stimulants do indeed change how they think, improving the effectiveness of their desired thought process.

            Adderall is just amphetamene, not methamphetamene. And the study doesn&#x27;t draw any conclusions about amphetamine.
