            Ok, so he teaches his kids how to hack school thru short term memory tricks and he&#x27;s upset that they haven&#x27;t learned anything. I don&#x27;t think school has failed them, thought school has it&#x27;s many faults, he has failed his kids. At some point he has to take responsibility to make sure his kids are educated by teaching them how to learn rather than to teach them how to get through tests with a good grade.

            The author&#x27;s polemic only shows that his middle-school children have no intrinsic interest in the history of the Roman Empire, and also don&#x27;t memorize arbitrary durations. Quick: how many years between the Mexican-American War and the Spanish-American War? What&#x27;s the air speed of an unladen swallow? Is this the author&#x27;s idea of an education?

            Have you tried the new math? The challenge is not a matter of the math, it’s a matter of formatting components of the answer in boxes. Without exposure to it, it’s nearly impossible to decipher. Which felt like half the point when I was doing it with my son.

            I understand the vitriol pointed at the “new math”, but it seems to me the complaints always focus towards “I got the right answer, why was I not rewarded?”. For it’s flaws, its seems these new programs are more focused on teaching kids how to reason, and as a result ask them to follow the process instead of simply arrive at the answer.

You can fit all the basic calculation skills people will need in everyday life in grade one to three, then teach them proper mathematics - which coincidentally means learning to reason in a <i>precise</i> manner.

            Have you tried Haskell? The challenge is not a matter of the programming, it’s a matter of formatting components of the answer in boxes. Without exposure to it, it’s nearly impossible to decipher.

            Agreed.  The author completely gets everything backward.<p>Why <i>should</i> his child care about how long America has existed unless it&#x27;s on a test?<p>If you don&#x27;t give someone a <i>reason</i> for why something is relevant, you won&#x27;t get anywhere.

            Yeah, studying history without questions is a chore.<p>A good question might be: &quot;Why did the Roman empire hold together that long and survived several serious crises, even though many other empires exploded and disintegrated in their first crisis ever, as the subjugated nations rushed for exits?&quot;<p>That question has no definite answer, but boy (or girl), you learn a lot of fascinating history while trying to answer it.

            This is one of the most facile articles i have ever read on HN. Other than the click-baity title there is nothing in it. The author did not teach his kids <i>to learn</i> but taught them <i>techniques to mug up</i> and sort of feels good about it?

            The guy can&#x27;t even teach his kids (agree that it is his teacher&#x27;s job but you are a parent, take him out and show the world) I wonder how he is the CEO and goes about mentoring&#x2F;writing books about leading. Seems like his whole life is a hack.

            I mean if your kids think that college is easy then they probably aren’t taking challenging classes. I don’t remember anyone thinking weed out Chem or physics was easy except one or 2 genius kids. Also if you take regular level classes you do indeed learn almost nothing because the curriculum is designed so median level achievers.

            &gt; I actually don’t worry about my kids’ futures at all. They will excel in whatever it is they choose to do. But it has nothing to do with their grades or schooling. I can see that they have a strong work ethic, they are kind, have high emotional intelligence, and good leadership and social skills. These are things they learned from family, church, athletics, activities and video games (yes, video games).<p>So, dean HNers, don&#x27;t worry about STEM. No need to train engineering, look into physics, think over math - no hard subjects required to get successful in the world. Just kindness and good leadership. Onwards, Jameses Kirks... wait a minute, Kirk was able to reprogram the simulation. Never mind then.
