            The article mentions losses at the hohlraum but doesn&#x27;t mention losses in the laser. &quot;Ignition&quot; means they controled the implosion well enough to break (almost) even on laser energy, but the laser itself is less than 1% efficient on wall power. Input energy to the entire system is over 400 MJ per shot. Even at max theoretical fusion yield, it wouldn&#x27;t come close to breakeven.<p>There&#x27;s also a firing rate issue. Even if the system produced net power, significant production would require many shots per second. Currently, the laser flash lamps are expendable and it takes on the order of a day (and lots of money) to prep for each shot.<p>Some of these drawbacks were addressed in the LIFE proposal, which would use fusion neutrons to burn fission fuel in a blanket around the fusion chamber. You could burn spent reactor fuel subcritically (no fission chain reaction), for example. But then it&#x27;s a fission machine, and criticality excursions aren&#x27;t much of an issue in conventional fission reactors. In the end, there are many drawbacks and little benefit with such a setup -- even if it worked.<p>I love lasers, and NIF is a marvel. But there really is no sensical story about power production in it. Even the machine&#x27;s stated purpose -- stockpile maintenence -- is highly dubious. It is really an elaborate welfare machine, given to weapons scientists in exchange for their support of testing bans.

            I think your take on this is accurate, but it’s a little deeper than a welfare program. The government needs to maintain a population of cleared scientists who know how to calculate things like fusion yields, simulated with classified codes. These fake fusion energy programs contribute to that; some of the most capable scientists don’t want to work on weapons, so they can kid themselves that they are working on “energy”.<p>There is no reasonably foreseeable future with fusion as part of the electricity grid. Even if we got fantastically lucky and were able to build a practical (magnetic or inertial) reactor in 50 years, by that time improvements in energy storage and transmission technologies will have allowed renewable energy to dominate, and no government  would be crazy enough to permit it to be built.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;progressive.org&#x2F;op-eds&#x2F;let-cut-our-losses-on-fusion-energy-180313&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;progressive.org&#x2F;op-eds&#x2F;let-cut-our-losses-on-fusion-e...</a>

            &gt; some of the most capable scientists don’t want to work on weapons, so they can kid themselves that they are working on “energy”.<p>This should be highlighted.<p>Anecdotally, I have a friend who worked at Macdonald-Detweiller on algorithms for handling the controlled descent of autonomously-guided aircraft when lacking propulsion and relying solely on gliding. She was horrified when I told her she was working on smart bomb guidance systems.

            By what deductive reasoning process, and evidence, made you come to that conclusion?<p>The flight profiles of a guided bomb - and a glider aircraft - are very different. I appreciate there’s a lot of dual-use, but I’m skeptical someone could be working on something so central to the system and not know what it’s really for - all of the stories of internal-disinformation I’ve heard about from the defence sector were all to keep “peripheral” workers quiet.

            Nope, newer guided bombs are almost all of the glide variety, see the SDB&#x2F;Stormbearker and JSOW.  They can achieve high glide ratios similar to aircraft, can follow pre programmed waypoints, have variable terminal profiles including the ability to attack from different directions, and can loiter.  Speaking as someone who just left that industry, she was 100% working on glide bombs.

If Fusion reactors could be realized, this would solve all energy problems. As you mention, renewables done right doesn&#x27;t stop at production but also includes global deployment of Smart Grids and Energy storage capabilities. It&#x27;s nuclear energy done in a reasonable way. Apart from that, it&#x27;s really not clear if production fusion reactors will ever be possible so it&#x27;s clearly a research topic. Perhaps better availability of computing power (to engineer the confining magnetic fields) and better abilities to orchestrate such complex projects will also help if you look at the challenges of the ITER project.

My motivation is not anti-scientific but in defense of real science that is not getting done because of the billions wasted on fake energy projects.

            I read your article here [1] and I&#x27;ve found it a bit problematic.<p>You don&#x27;t give a real foundation impetus to &#x27;stop&#x27; fusion research other than the perception not making enough progress in general terms, and that the money could be used on renewables.<p>It&#x27;s a problematic argument because &#x27;a few billion&#x27; is a very, very small amount of investment for an energy potentially which could yield significant results, even decades away.<p>It  maybe a 80 year-long project, even then, it would be worth it.<p>Renewables are not suffering from money otherwise allocated to Fusion.<p>I think if you gave some very specific arguments as to why some investment will not work - even as an experimental vehicle - that would lend more credibility to your argument, but then you&#x27;d also have to have that view corroborated in some way aka &#x27;this experiment does not materially advance science, and they know it, here is the evidence or logic&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;progressive.org&#x2F;op-eds&#x2F;let-cut-our-losses-on-fusion-energy-180313&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;progressive.org&#x2F;op-eds&#x2F;let-cut-our-losses-on-fusion-...</a>

            Reasoning by analogy is not valid reasoning.<p>With old and new computers, the physics are different - what makes the principles still work is that logics are the same, both have gates, memory etc.<p>With fusion you still have the same physical substrate you need to affect.<p>Also you have something backwards in your reasoning.

            I was not reasoning by analogy, I presented an example that contradicts the claim that machines meant for widespread adoption must resemble their experimental form.<p>The laws of physics are unchanged, computers improved because of clever workarounds that allowed us to accomplish the same tasks in easier ways. Practical fusion reactors need to produce power via fusion, but beyond that the how is irrelevant. Swap out different lasers, different magnets, different power supplies, hell even the fuels might be different, it&#x27;s frankly ignorant to claim that these changes are the same physics but &quot;use a shorter wavelength in your fab&quot; isn&#x27;t.<p>A modern computer in terms of number of logic gates is astronomically more complex than ENIAC, however what matters for practicality is not complexity but cost. The cost of complexity decreases as you learn what you&#x27;re doing. Chicago Pile 1 cost $17 million in today&#x27;s dollars to produce about half a watt of thermal power, or $34,000,000&#x2F;Wth. A modern nuclear plant costs about $2&#x2F;Wth. ITER will cost $45 Billion to generate 500 MW. If fusion sees 0.001% of the economic improvement that fission experienced, that&#x27;s $0.52&#x2F;Wth.

            The conclusion that DT fusion reactors will be expensive follows from basic engineering considerations on heat transfer, not from specifics of any design.  The volumetric power density will be lousy, so cost will be high.<p>&gt; A modern nuclear plant costs about $2&#x2F;Wth<p>This may have been the projection before the AP1000 and the EPR flamed out.  In practice, the cost can escalate well above that.  Their complexity made them difficult to build.  And yet, these designs have reactor power densities orders of magnitude better than ITER, and are far simpler (and more fault tolerant) than a fusion reactor would be.

            The cost is not a function of volumetric power density. I believe we have had this conversation before.<p>The most expensive nuclear plant projected to be constructed is the Hinkley Point C reactor. With all its overruns, it&#x27;s projected that the cost will be £23 Billion, which works out to $3.37&#x2F;Wth. $2&#x2F;Wth is a $6 billion 1000 MWe plant, quite typical. Note that this is for reactors in the west, in China, where non-technical issues like NIMBYism aren&#x27;t a concern, the cost is closer to $1&#x2F;Wth.

We can continue the argument here, if you can come up with any argument for your position that makes any sense.

            Maybe some vested interests don&#x27;t want to solve energy problems. Didn&#x27;t the cotton industry kill hemp in the early 30s or so? And created the whole Reefer Madness scare?<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t the natgas and upstream&#x2F;downstream petroleum industry want to do the same thing with any potential competitors? There is already propaganda about windmills killing seagulls and windmills being ugly, so why not take it an extra step and flash pictures of thalidomide babies and then say &quot;wow do you really want this?&quot; with respect to nuclear? Seems totally within the realm of possibility.<p>EDIT: Correction - I think I actually meant the petroleum industry when I was referring to cotton in this post. What killed the hemp industry in the 50s (I said 30s earlier but I made a mistake) apparently was the availability of inexpensive, manufactured synthetic fibers.

            This is deeply fascinating to read.<p>But what about projects like Iter? There&#x27;s a lot going on in fusion that has no alternative government justification. Surely those provide little to no value for weapons programs.<p>If fusion for grid-scale energy is really accepted to be non-viable (and if we&#x27;re honest... it is) then that has some pretty far-reaching consequences.<p>I don&#x27;t think that fusion is categorically non-viable, but the approaches of the currently funded megaprojects all seem to be. More creative and compact approaches could still have potential. Of course, there&#x27;s always PACER, which illustrates our cognitive dissonance.

            There are plenty of true believers working in fusion energy. Enough to support big projects like ITER.<p>But consider this analogous situation. I was working in a government physics lab when Star Wars (excuse me—SDI) was still a program that you could get money from for all kinds of projects. Nobody—I mean nobody—actually doing research believed in the program. That we would actually build a Star Wars defense shield to make Ronald Reagan proud. But they happily sent off grant proposals and were glad to accept money to work on various things. You can spin lots of pet projects so it sounds like they are all about missile defense. But the algorithms I worked on, during my brief involvement, would have been more useful for game design.

            Fusion isn’t just about grid power.  In terms of covering the needs for food, shelter, etc the Hubble telescope,  cassini probe, large hadron collider etc are useless. However, there’s plenty of economic capacity to push limits simply to explore what’s possible and what’s out there.<p>Fusion is likely the energy source of the future and that’s ok.  It’s ok to dream of far future deep space colonization, and take just one tiny step closer to that dream.

            Mass, sustainable renewables with large energy-storage systems do kinda make fusion unnecessary though.<p>Places with existing gas and oil, and maybe even coal, power stations aren’t going to tear them down when fusion becomes do-able or even economically viable.  Not just due to the sunk-cost fallacy but because they don’t want 10,000+ newly unemployed workers who honestly probably won’t retrain for fusion. And more reasons like that.

            I think you overestimate how much companies care about their existing employees.  If firing 90% of them is significantly more profitable that’s what their going to do.  Solar is so cheap largely because it needs very few workers per GWh so they can fire people.<p>I personally doubt Fusion will be significantly cheaper than Fission let alone coal any time soon.  But, if it happens their not going to care about their workforce.  That said, fission &gt; fusion isn’t going to require more training for most of the workers.  In many locations they would both have identical cooling towers for example.

            Who knows, fusion could be key to accessing the next order-of-magnitude level for society. Perhaps it&#x27;ll be key to large scale carbon sequestration to stabilize future climate change effects.<p>If we had cheap Fusion tomorrow we could replace much of fossil fuels with synth fuels with neutral CO2 cycle. We get to reuse existing infrastructure but without massive co2.

            It could, but IMO it&#x27;s a very low odds bet.  There are fundamental physical reasons why fusion reactors will struggle to compete.  Fusion is a technology that IMO persists on cultural momentum, a meme technology that is part of the future because that&#x27;s a story that we&#x27;ve been told since the 1950s.  I think the most likely end will be that controlled fusion will go into a similar niche as dirigibles and vacuum tubes as a retrofuturistic anachronism.  It will be recognized as something that used to be part of the future, but no longer is.

            It might be be cheaper than fission. More complex reactor vs less need for thick containment walls and likely fewer NIMBY issues. Decommissioning costs are likely significantly lower. Operating costs and downtime are more questionable as you don’t need nearly as much security or to deal with enrichment and spent fuel.  No need for radioactive plumbing etc. Even just constructing fuel rods is shockingly expensive.<p>D-T requires extracting tritium from a breeder blanket which will likely be very expensive.  But the ratio of T:D can be lowered the more efficient the design, with pure D-D designs avoiding that issue entirely.

            Here is an article about the probably unavoidable downsides of fusion [0], from the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. To summarize their points:<p>- neutron bombardment, the unavoidable consequence of the only realistic fusion reaction, deuterium + tritium, turns every known material brittle and radioactive; and can be trivially used for uranium enrichment<p>- tritium is almost impossible to contain, and requires fission plants to create - the fusion plants could theoretically create a surplus, but they would have to recapture essentially 100% of a very hard to capture gas (today they normally leak about 10% of the injected tritium)<p>- fusion plants need to be massive to be even close to break-even - the energy drain of the facility consumes a sizeable portion of the generated energy; most of this power drain is still required while the facility is not operating the reactor, increasing projected costs of running a facility<p>- ICF tech is very close to fusion weapon tech, so there is a massive risk for proliferation from there as well; MCF tech is not, thankfully<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebulletin.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;fusion-reactors-not-what-theyre-cracked-up-to-be&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebulletin.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;fusion-reactors-not-what-the...</a>

            I don&#x27;t think the containment (and a containment will be needed) will be significantly cheaper.  The fusion reactor itself is much larger, and accessing it (like, lifting the top off an ARC reactor) will require considerable volume.  ITER has a large volume around it where robotic servicing equipment can be arranged to get inside the reactor.<p>All this volume will have to be hermetically sealed from the outside world, since it will become permeated with tritium.  Keeping that tritium from escaping the building will be a major headache (polymer seals cannot be used on penetrations, as tritium permeates through polymers).  This will be true in any fuel cycle using deuterium, not just DT, since D+D -&gt; T+p reactions will be occurring.

            A commercial reactor will involve far larger amounts of tritium, and the structure of the reactor will be so hot that tritium will permeate through it.  The amount of tritium made and consumed in a 1 GW(e) DT fusion reactor in a year would be enough, if it were all released, to raise two months of the entire flow of the Mississippi River above the legal limit for drinking water.   Containment is going to have to be extremely good.

            Their never going to have a full years tritium on hand so that’s kind of an odd benchmark.  Getting the cost of Tritium down to $10,000 per gram is somewhat optimistic, significant effort is going to be used to recover it.<p>As to the Mississippi River flow estimate that’s something like 6 orders of magnitude larger than what I am referring to.  Still, the other way of looking at that statistic is if half of the Tritium used per day was dumped into the Missisippi every day it would be considered safe to drink when well mixed.

            That figure was to point out the large volume flowing through the system.  Containment will have to be very good.  Only a tiny percentage of that tritium can be allowed to escape.<p>Realize also that what has to be constrained is the cumulative leakage from all fusion power plants, not just a single one.   The world would need on the order of 10,000 1GW power plants, to displace fossil fuels.

            That’s moving the goalposts, the US only has 95.5 gigawatts of nuclear power and it’s moving away from nuclear.  At that level even just 99.9% containment you can replace all US fission reactors and have 1&#x2F;10th the annual releases your concerned about spread across a much larger area.<p>Globally, I do think fission or potentially fusion has a minor role because it could be important for a few countries locally even if it’s not cost effective in most areas.

            It&#x27;s not moving the goalposts, it&#x27;s describing the scale of the problem.  If fusion won&#x27;t be addressing a significant fraction of the CO2 problem, it will be because it&#x27;s inferior to the non-fossil energy sources that are.  In which case, why is it even needed?<p>Nuclear fission looks unable to compete with renewables at current prices in almost all the world.  There&#x27;s a zone around Poland where it does the best.  But even those zones go away as renewables and storage proceed down their experience curves.  If there are very minor niche uses, fission would work just fine vs. fusion, particularly in high latitude countries that are already members of the nuclear club.

            The cynical take is a product of talking to engineers, not scientists.<p>The tragedy of engineering is that in any market niche, generally only one technology can win.  The others are driven to extinction.  It&#x27;s like ecology&#x27;s &quot;one niche, one species&quot; rule.  As Freeman Dyson pointed out, this is not like science, where multiple complementary theories may coexist.   We build chips from silicon, not GaAs or superconducting niobium or any of the other possible technologies that were considered over the decades.<p>An engineer, if he&#x27;s old enough, will have seen many technologies come up then fail and die.  There are more ways to solve problems than there are sufficiently distinct problems, so this is inevitable.   When fusion competes with fission, and wind, and solar, and geothermal, and..., it&#x27;s a fight to the death.   The notion that fusion is inevitable is a stacking of the mental deck to just assume fusion will win this competition.

            100MW seems like a substantial moving of the goalposts, given your earlier statement that &quot;there is no reasonably foreseeable future with fusion as part of the electricity grid&quot; and that I&#x27;ve already cut the timetable by 25 years :) That said, I&#x27;ll still accept - I&#x27;m emailing you at your profile address for the details!

            Is that a prescriptive or descriptive statement?

            Seems like any profitable plant should count. Some designs work best at smaller scales, but if they worked out they&#x27;d be cheap and for more power you just build a lot of them. Even in fission, there&#x27;s a big push now to build reactors small enough to mass-produce in factories. Maybe say at least 100MW total power?

            Yeah maybe leave out &quot;profitable,&quot; it&#x27;s too fuzzy and hard to verify.

            Lower power density implies larger size, which implies higher cost.   Since the parts outside the reactors themselves (the turbines, generators, heat sink, etc.) will be similar, this means a fusion power plant will cost more to build that a fission power plant.<p>The other problem is that size is also related to reliability.   A fusion reactor will have many more parts than a fission reactor.  It will also be much more complex, and operate at higher radiation and thermal stresses.  This is particularly important because it is very difficult to repair something that is so radioactive that hands-on access is not possible.

            Fusion still has to deal with waste, just not high-level waste. Through the process of neutron activation all of the parts exposed to neutrons eventually become radioactive enough to be treated as low-level waste. In a reactor large enough to produce energy for the grid these parts could be very large (and expensive) to deal with (not to mention replace).

            Yes, though the article consists almost entirely of reasons why aneutronic fusion is <i>really hard</i> (&quot;the conditions required to harness aneutronic fusion are much more extreme than those required for deuterium-tritium fusion being investigated in ITER&quot;).<p>Note that the &quot;Candidate fuels&quot; section is not part of &quot;Technical Challenges&quot;, but it might as well be. Helium-3, by far the easiest, is vanishingly rare. Deuterium would not really be aneutronic. Then further down is a list of worse and worse headaches.<p>The leading scenario for acquiring the most convenient fuel candidate is &quot;mining it on the moon&quot;. (The alternative scenario being to scale up production of tritium by existing heavy-water reactors from the nuclear weapons program, which decays into helium-3... and defeats the point of researching extremely complex, clean, aneutronic fusion reactors)<p>I want to like aneutronic fusion, but it takes an objective that is several breakthroughs away and plays the game on nightmare mode.

            Anything beyond D-3He or D-D is likely impossible.  And any fuel with deuterium will still make enough neutrons to render the reactor inaccessible to hands-on maintenance.  So there will still be a waste problem (as well as a huge reliability and maintenance problem).  The reactor might not AS MUCH radioactivity, but much of the cost of dealing with it will scale with the mass of the contaminated material, not its activity.  And fusion reactors will be very large.  The cost of dealing with the activated material might end up higher than the cost of dealing with spent fission reactor fuel.

            There is no meltdown risk with modern fission reactor designs. But there is the waste problem.<p>If you follow the links my Op-Ed, you’ll find articles describing the radioactive waste and proliferation risks that will accompany <i>any</i> fusion reactor. Not as great as fission, but far from zero. And there is the problem of production and transportation of tritium, a very nasty substance.<p>A commercial fusion reactor would be fantastically expensive and complex, and require a huge infrastructure to support it.

            Couldn&#x27;t you use regular fusor to generate neutrons to enrich uranium? Do you specifically need neutrons with the 14.1Mev energy produced by D-T fusion (which you can make in a regular fusor, if you have the tritium for it) or is there a path starting from lower energy levels? Or do fusors just not make enough neutrons for enrichment to be practical?

            Not necessarily, if I take “any other” literally.<p>Tritium’s low molecular weight means that a bomb can disperse it over a large area. It has a half-life of 12.5 years and its beta radiation is known to be carcinogenic from animal studies. An inhaled, microscopic bit of tritium will be irradiating your lung tissue for many years, although the actual effects of this are not known. However, it is very strictly controlled, and you need all kinds of special licences and certifications to use it in your laboratory, for these reasons.<p>So the lure for the terrorist is just that: it’s good for terror, because of the psychological effect.<p>“What about when compared to the general damage caused by mining and burning coal?”<p>If the choice were between coal and fusion, for me there would be no contest. We would have to put everything into developing fusion power. Fortunately, there are alternatives that are better than either and are <i>already working</i>.

            Dirty bombs are actually terribly ineffective weapons. The radiation would be unlikely to harm anyone who wasn&#x27;t close enough to be killed by the conventional explosives unless they spent a considerable amount of time in the irradiated area afterwards without any sort of protection. While the cleanup operation could be expensive, the whole affair would be more an inconvenience than anything else. On the plus side though, now you can detect the terrorists&#x27; essentially conventional explosive which would otherwise be quite concealable with radiation detectors.<p>Also tritium is essentially harmless. It is an incredibly weak beta emitter - the electrons it emits won&#x27;t make it through the upper layers of dead skin if it&#x27;s outside of your body. It  has an extremely short residency period in the body if it is ingested (a benefit of being chemically identical to hydrogen). It also will dissipate in an area rapidly - it rises quickly and even if it is in an enclosed space it will pass straight through the walls. Also it&#x27;s worth noting that a fusion plant like ITER has less than a gram of tritium inside of it at any given time.

            You’re correct about the skin penetration, but the risk with tritium is in inhalation. Experiments with mice demonstrate carcinogenesis. The increase in cancer risk from inhaled tritium in humans is unknown, but the substance is considered dangerous enough that it’s a pain in the ass to get the certifications to use it in your laboratory. It definitely should not be considered harmless.<p>I worked with Stephen Bodner on the fusion program mentioned in the fine article. We did our experiments with deuterium. The reason we did not use DT, which would have been better for the experiments, is because nobody wanted to (1) go through the hassle of getting the lab certified to handle tritium&#x27; (2) get anywhere near the stuff. It is considered very hazardous.

            Tritium is a pain in the ass to get certifications for because it is so difficult to contain. Even in an airtight setup, it will leak. If you spend a substantial amount of time in lab with a tritium leak, and are inhaling the stuff over months or years, yes it&#x27;s dangerous, but hydrogen doesn&#x27;t remain in your body long enough for a single brief exposure to do anything.<p>Mercury vapor is very hazardous, that doesn&#x27;t mean a mercury bomb is an effective weapon.

            Your points are solid; I accept that this material would not be very effective as a weapon, except maybe in a confined space.

            The problem with this statement is that you are <i>assuming</i> tritium would be “great for dirty bombs and catnip for terrorists”. But then you go on to say that it hasn&#x27;t happened yet other than in films because there are no fusion reactors yet. This is, in other words, speculation.

            The problem of fission isn&#x27;t meltdown risk or waste (or fuel availability), the problem of fission is capital cost.  The capital cost of a fusion power plant is likely to be much higher than that of a fission power plant of equal capacity.

            &gt; and no government would be crazy enough to permit it to be built<p>I can imagine China building one simply for the national prestige. &quot;China built the world&#x27;s first commercial nuclear fusion power station&quot;. The Chinese government wants to prove itself the equal of other major world powers (especially the US) and being the first country to have commercial nuclear fusion would be a good way of sending that message. Even if it is more expensive and less safe than renewable energy.<p>And then the US government would build one to &quot;counter the nuclear fusion gap with China&quot; and &quot;ensure American supremacy in nuclear fusion technology&quot;.<p>That said, this isn&#x27;t going to be technically feasible for a few more decades (at least), and we don&#x27;t know what the geopolitical situation will be like by then. Maybe China-US competition will still be as strong, even stronger, then as now. Maybe it will be in the past and the world will have moved on to something else. Who knows.

            Having toured NIF a few times and worked in one of the buildings adjacent to it a few summers ago, I will say the energy stuff always seemed more like a way to get funding. The main use and aim for NIF is and always has been to re-create some of the conditions inside nuclear weapons and similar fusion-based reactions.<p>The whole NIF building has the ability to switch modes between classified and unclassified. They wouldn&#x27;t have gone through the trouble of making this a toggleable feature on the building if they weren&#x27;t actively using it for both.

            I don&#x27;t know the specifics but I imagine most of it is waving a magic wand and saying <i>poof</i> now this room is classified. But there are logistics that go with that, certain door technologies that have to be in place, probably some complex security procedure for &quot;switching&quot; between modes, (i.e. I would think they need to clear the building of uncleared personnel and be 100% sure there isn&#x27;t someone hiding in a bathroom somewhere) etc etc, and it&#x27;s enough of a pain that most buildings are either one or the other all the time. The ability to switch on the fly for a large facility like that is super rare and indicative of there being a real need for switching.<p>All I know for sure is on the tour they mention they can switch the whole building to be unclassified or classified and during the tour it is in unclassified mode.

            &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s also a firing rate issue. Even if the system produced net power, significant production would require many shots per second. Currently, the laser flash lamps are expendable and it takes on the order of a day (and lots of money) to prep for each shot.<p>Oh, but then there&#x27;s this part:<p>&gt;&gt; Further experiments will require the manufacture of additional fuel capsules and hohlraums. These may not be ready until at least October, Herrmann says. The nanocrystalline diamond-coated capsule that was imploded in this month’s event took six months to grow at General Atomics, which has long worked with LLNL on fabricating capsules. The spheres have to be polished and the core’s interior etched with tools inserted through a 2-micron-diameter hole drilled into it. The tritium–deuterium mixture is injected through a tiny fill tube just prior to the shot.

            The nuclear stockpile bit is kind of true, although it&#x27;s sort of true, HEDP systems are the only way in a controlled setting to create nuclear level conditions without setting off a nuke. That said, NIF at least from the energy perspective just like ITER was just to push the research forward than it was to produce break-even fusion in 10 years. If you really want that you&#x27;ll need gobs of money, probably even beyond the level of things like the LHC. The reason we don&#x27;t have fusion in either field (MCF or ICF) is because we don&#x27;t fund it to that level.<p>EDIT: on funding, this[0] image shows what is neccessary and the level we actually funded. It&#x27;s been around for a while but it may prove informative for the uninitiated.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;3vYLQmm.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;3vYLQmm.png</a>

            For context, in wired chip-to-chip communication electronics, femtosecond variations are (statistically) measurable. Picoseconds are rather pedestrian. A 56 Gbaud signal has a single-symbol duration of about 18 picoseconds and perturbations on the order of 1 picosecond are rather large 5.6%.<p>Not to downplay the achievement of the article or the innovation in fusion physics and engineering in general, just a bit of context for the timescales.

            A nice rule of thumb for these kind of timescales (courtesy of a lecture by Grace Hopper) is to consider the speed of light: 1 nanosecond at the speed of light is about 1 foot (300 mm). A picosecond is then 0.3 mm.

            Which is also a method to shift light pulses by the shortest of durations! Insert an optical delay line into the setup and by varying the path length, you can delay a light pulse by a tiny amount of time, e.g. for a pump-probe experiment (a pump-probe experiment works like this: first pulse does something to the system (&quot;pump&quot;), second pulse comes a short time later and reads out (&quot;probes&quot;) the state of the system at that time. Changing the time delay gives an idea of the dynamics).<p>Here is a drawing of an optical delay line: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thorlabs.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;TabImages&#x2F;Delay_Line_Kit_D1-780.gif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thorlabs.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;TabImages&#x2F;Delay_Line_Kit_D1-...</a><p>The part labelled &quot;V-Block&quot; can move along the &quot;translation stage&quot; which changes the length of the optical path by twice this amount. Use the speed of light to calculate which delay the pulse incurred over the distance. You can now send pulse after pulse through your setup while changing the delay by tiny amounts to see how things (e.g. chemical processes) happen on these time scales.

            And it&#x27;s important to note that these developments in sensor technologies can be carried forward to future experiments even if the NIF is ultimately incapable of being improved much further. The quest for fusion is not simply achieved or failed, working on tough problems like this leads to technological progress at every step along the way.

            A considerable number of post-1960 Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry, as well as a fair bit of the medicine ones, come from sensor-related discoveries.<p>Either they&#x27;re directly applicable to sensing phenomena, or they form a substantial part of a sensor technology.<p>Contrast with the pre-1960 period which was dominated by discovery of fundamental particals, elements, and laws or principles.<p>Disclaimers:  this is based on a somewhat casual review of awards, and even if my own assessment is reliable, the Nobel award process itself has numerous opportunities for bias and trend-based behaviours.

            Reading the info so far...I would advise a frugal dose of 
moderate optimist toned down with a spice of healthy scepticism:<p>&quot;The lab hasn’t yet reproduced this month’s results, and Herrmann cautioned that doing so might not be straightforward. “We don’t know what variability will be in successive shots. It’s a nonlinear process where alpha heating heats up the fusion fuel and creates more fusion, which creates more heat.” Herrmann says the 3.5 MeV alpha particles, which remain in the plasma, produced 20% of the fusion yield, with 14 MeV neutrons accounting for most of the energy.&quot;<p>&quot;The lab is still analyzing the results from the shot. It’s not yet known which or what combination of advances to the targets, laser pulse lengths, or other variables led to the leap in performance. Some of the instruments were saturated by the unexpected yield of the reaction. A few that are used in the target chamber for other, non-ignition experiments will need repair.&quot;<p>&quot;Herrmann acknowledged that the announcement deviates from the standard practice of peer-reviewed publication. But the results, he says, were leaking, “so we wanted to put it out so people could discuss the facts.”  &quot;

            This is fantastic. And I agree with the fellow mentioning direct drive as better. If you can get the same results using direct drive, you’ll have a sizable energy gain above what the input energy was, perhaps enough to drive a (multiple stage) heat engine and produce net electricity.<p>Anyway, I also want to point out that laser inertial confinement fusion bears a not-coincidental (some of the same codes and plasma physics techniques developed for laser fusion were used by Lawrence Livermore and others to develop EUV) resemblance to the extreme UV light sources sold by ASML and used for the highest end computer chips today. Compare the LIFE fusion reactor concept (based on an evolution of the NIF) with the EUV light source of droplets of tin being hit with a pulsed laser:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laser_Inertial_Fusion_Energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laser_Inertial_Fusion_Energy</a><p>EUV light source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IattxYrc9Go" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IattxYrc9Go</a><p>(The Hohlrahm of the National Ignition Facility, surrounding the tritium deuterium fuel pellet, is acting like the tin droplet of the EUV light source, converting longer wavelength pulsed laser light to (near) X-Rays.)

            That is not quite correct. Yes, its primary purpose is “stockpile management,” but it’s not <i>exclusively</i> that. It was ALSO sold as a facility to study fusion power generation, hence this announcement.<p>LIFE was a proposed follow-on project to NIF that would be focused on power generation demonstration (high repetition rates, etc). It never went anywhere and work on it effectively stopped around 2013 or so.

            I picked up on that angle as well.<p>“Ignition” isn’t about generating electricity.  It’s about making fusion bombs which don’t emit neutrons or other radiation (from a fission trigger) while the device is in storage.<p>So, not primarily a power generation design like a tokamak would be.

            The US gives about the same amount of money to the National Ignition Facility as to the ITER project, roughly half a billion dollars per year (a bit more for NIF, a bit less for ITER). Of course, the main objective of the NIF is to assist in the stewardship of the nuclear stockpile, not to seek economic nuclear fusion. Still, it&#x27;s great that they achieved this milestone.

            MCF faces a few engineering hurdles.  ICF faces several times more.  Investing in a facility on the scale of NIF for ICF doesn&#x27;t make much sense if the goal is economic fusion power on the grid.  There are much lower hanging fruits where that money could be spent: such as on new MCF machines or a wider and shallower mix of ICF machines.  Ask non-US fusion researchers how they feel about ICF if you want a proper outside perspective.

            Magnetic confinement fusion like ITER is no less of a boondoggle. Maybe even more so because the progress is intentionally slow in spite of not having a dual-role for “stockpile stewardship.” ITER is being funded not just by the US but by many countries, started development in 1985, detailed design in 2001, and construction in 2013, but it’s not even PLANNED to get full fusion until 2035. <i>2035</i>!<p>Plus, it won’t even generate electricity at all. That’s planned for the DEMO reactor that won’t start operation until 2051 at earliest. It is depressingly slow if you think one of the main reasons we should be developing alternative energy sources is to address climate change. It’s so bad as to qualify as a waste and maybe even a negative investment as it’s pulling a bunch of researchers toward a project that literally has no hope of being relevant to fighting climate change (as its first possible kilowatt-hour of electricity won’t start until 30 years from now, well after we’ve exhausted our carbon budget for 2 degrees C of warming).

            I also understand that fusion in general is unlikely to be an economically-viable energy source anyway, since the reactor and any surrounding material will be relatively quickly (~few years) be made brittle by the neutron bombardment, while also becoming radioactive - meaning any fusion plant will have to be carefully and constantly torn down and rebuilt, and materials from the old plant securely stored for large amounts of time (not as large as fission waste, but still in the order of decades or centuries). There are other concerns with hydrogen escape etc, but this one seems completely fundamental.

            Some methods of fusion solve this in varying ways, with liquid metal blankets, etc, or using non-neutron is fusion fuels. But that’s missing the point. There’s no path to these more viable methods of economically producing power that don’t run through the path of generating more fusion energy than it absorbs, so we start with the easier fuels first to prove we can do sustained fusion before worrying too much about neutron embrittlement.

            The first job of ITER is to show that disruptions can be controlled.  This is absolutely necessary, and requires access to the machine to repair it when disruptions occur.  So this had better be done without tritium (or possibly even deuterium).  And if they can&#x27;t do it, they will never be allowed to operate the machine with tritium.

            Mirrors are interesting.  They hit very high performance metrics in a small budget.  However they have this pesky issue of requiring an electrostatic field.  Conduction losses are a killer, scale up in nasty ways, and ablate material quickly.<p>In terms of inexpensive neutron sources: they&#x27;re perhaps some of the best we have.

            I&#x27;m pleased to say I finally have funds to start construction on my new theoretical fusion reactor.<p>In a loose way it is similar to the inertial confinement at LLNL, but instead of pulsing 3 to 4 times per day, I&#x27;ll be creating billions of implosions per second. This is possible because of the way I recycle energy that is otherwise lost, not needing a hohlraum(heating only the Deuterium), and ramping up the implosion energy harmonically instead of brute forcing it with a single large punch.<p>I have more information at www.DDproFusion.com

            It’s not more bombs so much as maintaining our existing nuclear deterrent without actually testing warheads by blowing them up, something that, thankfully, is behind us. Warheads deteriorate over time; you can’t just keep them on the shelf and claim that they will still work if used. And our adversaries know this.

            I&#x27;m honestly not sure why there seems to be so much interest in fusion these days. Wind and solar seem to offer a limitless, carbon-free energy supply with relatively cheap, well understood technology that is already price competitive with coal and gas. By contrast fusion seems super expensive and technologically very complex - even fission plants take 10+ years to bring on line.  Does fusion offer some advantage over wind + solar that I&#x27;m missing?

            My armchair&#x2F;spectator interest in fusion comes from the idea of significantly increasing the energy available per capita, without increasing carbon footprint.  Traditional renewables might meet our current energy needs eventually.  Fusion could let everyone on the planet enjoy the same, or even a significantly increased, lifestyle.  As the saying used to be long before I was born, &quot;energy too cheap to meter&quot; (though obviously it still would be metered).<p>With enough surplus energy, you could run entire reactors just for carbon sequestration, or nation-scale desalination, or climate engineering, or what have you.

            A joke some friends of mine who study fusion make to this kind of comment; wind and solar are fusion powered.<p>In a simpler way of looking at it, (1) what is the source of the energy of solar&#x2F;wind? (2) how much land and materials are required to linearly increase power production?<p>There is a finite amount of space and resources on the planet to continue to scale power production with humanities consumption.<p>Fusion, preferably MCF&#x2F;tokamaks in the style of smaller sized ones like SPARC @ MIT and less like ITER (behemoths that take decades to build and maintain) offer two things (1) the fuel is comprised of the most common elements in the universe, (2) power per square foot is much greater than solar or wind... And bonus (3) once developed it should in theory require less material per watt generated. And less materials mean less processing and fabrication which in turn reduces the environmental impact on the planet.

            As stronglikedan said, spaceflight propulsion&#x2F;institutional inertia. (Stationary space facilities will use solar, just like on Earth. Space transport, unlike Earth transport, will be an awful combo of slow and expensive. Space stations will need to be <i>simple.</i> One type of computer. One type of microcontroller board. Maybe three sizes of screw. Solar panels are simple, identical, and interchangeable. And not radioactive! (Fun fact: every bolt on the outside of the ISS uses the exact same head size: 7&#x2F;16&quot; hex))<p>Seasonal variation with solar is a bit of a bummer. If we need to fully electrify everything, (Transport and heating) then winter will be a problem. Either we massively overprovision solar in order to still have heat on the shortest day of the year, or we run thousand mile cross-country transmission lines and <i>enormous</i> battery banks.<p>Even so, the economics are such that heavy industry might become a seasonal job. Right now we run aluminum smelters 24&#x2F;7 because baseload power is fairly consistent, but if solar power is free in July but dear in January you might see multi-month shutdowns. This gives headaches to central planners, and makes them inclined to pour billions into fusion if it can preserve some of the status quo.

            If the tropics threaten to become uninhabitable countries like India will go ahead with direct climate engineering by dispersing fine particles in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight.   This need not be at all expensive, even for them.  No credible threat from other countries would deter them, as they&#x27;d face mass destruction otherwise.

            I think wind and solar are plan A at this point, if for no other reason than they&#x27;re hard to beat on cost.  Battery storage is still expensive, though.<p>If fusion works out, it could be used to make up the difference when the sun isn&#x27;t shining and the wind isn&#x27;t blowing (though if we eventually get high-capacity transcontinental HVDC lines to buy and sell power from practically anywhere or batteries become really cheap, that becomes less of a concern).<p>Fusion would also would require far less land, and some people object to having a landscape covered in windmills and solar panels.<p>Fusion might be useful in places where renewables are less practical, like on ships.  Naval vessels might conceivably replace fission reactors with fusion.  If they&#x27;re safe and relatively simple to run, you might even see them on civilian ships.  Or you could have fusion reactors in remote places, like floating on a buoy in the middle of the ocean, to serve as a charging station for battery-powered ships.<p>Fusion may be useful for establishing a human foothold outside of Earth.  For instance, methane production on Mars (for rocket fuel) will require enormous amounts of energy, which could be supplied by a fusion reactor.  (A fission reactor would perhaps work just as well, but there are legitimate reasons why people get nervous about launching hazardous materials into space on a rocket that might blow up before it achieves escape velocity.)<p>We might also begin engaging in projects that require enormous amounts of energy.  For instance, if certain CO2 absorption strategies are energy-intensive, and we can&#x27;t practically generate that amount of energy from renewables.<p>At this point, we really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll work much less what the practical limitations will be, so perhaps the best we can do is say &quot;if a fusion reactor can produce X amount of energy and weighs Y tons and requires such-and-such amount of cooling and requires an overhaul once every N months at a cost of D dollars, we might want to use it in these applications&quot;.

            Hydrogen made from renewables and burning in combined cycle turbines would likely be far cheaper than fusion.<p>Fusion would be horrible for ships.  Ships are volume constrained, and fusion reactors are very large.<p>Land constraints are not globally significant at current energy demand.  The world is constantly hit by 100,000 TW of sunlight; average global primary energy demand is about 18 TW.<p>In space, DT fusion reactors will be inferior to fission reactors, which will be much smaller and lighter for a given power output (and also much simpler).<p>It&#x27;s very difficult now to make a case for fusion.  In the past, the case was something like &quot;fission will be a big winner, but then we&#x27;ll have trouble with uranium availability and safety and waste, and fusion, while slightly more expensive than fission, will still be cheap and solve these problems.&quot;  But that&#x27;s not how it turned out -- fission failed because it was too expensive, and fusion being even more expensive than fission makes it a nonstarter.

            Fusion doesn&#x27;t have to be big.  ITER is huge because it was the smallest it could possibly be given the superconducting magnetic coils that were available at the time it was being designed, but we have much better high temperature superconductors now.  (This is the basis of MIT&#x27;s SPARC and ARC projects.)<p>Currently, we don&#x27;t have any practical working fusion reactors, so it&#x27;s hard to say what the attributes of such a reactor would be.  We have some designs that according to our understanding of physics might work, but the designs are likely to go through many iterations before we have something that can be mass-produced and deployed in volume.  Rebco tape probably isn&#x27;t the best high-temperature superconductor that will ever be discovered.  And so on.

            &gt; Fusion doesn&#x27;t have to be big.<p>It does, actually, with neutron producing fuels.  The problem is that volumetric power density is limited by the areal power density limit on the wall of the reactor, and by the need of a sufficiently thick blanket to absorb neutrons.  The inferiority vs. fission is roughly (thickness of fusion reactor blanket)&#x2F;(diameter of fission reactor fuel rod).  This is independent of any details of plasma confinement.<p>Something like ARC has much higher power density than ITER, but it&#x27;s still very inferior to fission reactor.  ITER&#x27;s power density is just so incredibly bad.

            It&#x27;s a direct rebuttal to the false statement &quot;Also for the same reason deployment would be faster allowing a faster phase out of fossil fuels.&quot;<p>Fossil fuels had better be phased out soon, and fusion cannot be available in that time.<p>IMO, the prospects of fusion reaching a practical state are so remote that even the current level of funding on it is difficult to justify.

            Fusion (and fission, if we are willing) would be the only way to actually reverse climate change by using CO2 capture and then electrolysis to put carbon back in the ground.

            Basically the same idea. 80% of fusion&#x27;s energy output is in neutrons, which would be absorbed by special shielding around the vessel, while the other 20% is released as hot plasma that would heat up the inner surface of the vessel.

            There&#x27;s a long history of fraud and misleading &#x2F; sensational claims made my companies in the fusion space. The industry is nowhere near break-even (total energy into system == total energy out). ITER is a great example today. This is covered well with in-depth research by journalist Steven B. Krivit. He&#x27;s put together a documentary exposing ITER&#x27;s many false and dubious claims that I recommend watching: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xnikAFWDhNw&amp;t=8s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xnikAFWDhNw&amp;t=8s</a>

            There are two different definitions of breakeven, and science journalism is usually not good at making those distinct (and yeah, often the press releases from the institutions don&#x27;t help).  &quot;Scientific&quot; breakeven is the first milestone we&#x27;ll hit, and that&#x27;s what NIF is claiming to be close to.  You&#x27;re referring to what&#x27;s known as &quot;engineering&quot; breakeven, which is harder to achieve and requires yet higher fusion yields. Unless you hear otherwise, assume that anyone talking about breakeven means &quot;scientific&quot; breakeven -- if they&#x27;d achieved &quot;engineering&quot; breakeven, they&#x27;d make sure to spell that out!

            I remember a talk ten years by the director of LL describing how a power plant would potentially need something like liquid lithium walls to absorb the energy and transfer heat to steam. That sounded amazing.<p>Also, ASML did commercialize EUV which relies on blasting a steady drip stream of molten tin, and people 10 years ago said it would never be useful for industry…

            Releasing more energy is good, but is it enough of a difference that the delta can be captured (assuming imperfect capture process) + is it able to offset the cost of the expensive laser setup (maintenance)?

            Baby steps, there are any number of issues to address if the goal was to create something that is energy producing for consumption. However, taking out even any aspect of commercialization or scaling this is an important milestone in terms of science and engineering. That&#x27;s not to say don&#x27;t ask those questions, it is just allow the excitement of progress while asking future questions.

            I can&#x27;t help but wonder, with fusion: 
When we&#x27;ll be able to harness this energy in a stable and net producing manner, yes that will cut carbon emissions and solve the nuclear waste problem, but also, is it going to be the catalyst that will enable humanity to accelerate wreaking havoc on what&#x27;s left of our ecosystems?

            &gt; is it going to be the catalyst that will enable humanity to accelerate wreaking havoc on what&#x27;s left of our ecosystems?<p>The question is how cheap can it get, can the energy production scale up vs cost, and how much does maintenance cost.<p>This is a good video about fission energy production economics <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cbeJIwF1pVY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cbeJIwF1pVY</a><p>If one of these fusion reactor projects results in a competitively priced power plant, ok, we can reduce fossil fuel energy production towards zero in a few decades.  That&#x27;s pretty good for the environment but nothing really &quot;new&quot; is possible.<p>If one of these fusion reactor projects results in a 10x reduction in the cost of electricity... then we have something new.  Things that people didn&#x27;t imagine being possible before become possible.<p>Things like desalination instead of taking water from rivers or aquifers because it&#x27;s cheaper.  Tearing down dams because the power isn&#x27;t needed.  &quot;Farms&quot; in skyscrapers packed with artificial light where food can be produced without pesticides or herbicides because it&#x27;s a controlled environment.  Using landfills like mines, extracting tiny amounts of useful materials so ordinary mining becomes much less needed.<p>You can also think of plenty of things cheap plentiful energy could make happen that are destructive too... it is difficult to project and I assume will go in both directions.

            For me what you write reads like &quot;we need to focus on treating the symptoms rather than the cause of our problems.&quot;<p>Are we so attached to always having more and more? mostly to the benefit of a handful of super wealthy? While our democraties become authoritarian and ecosystems collapse?<p>Social justice (not a skewed idea of &quot;progress&quot;) goes hand in hand with solving the ecological crisis.

            It seems like your &quot;real problem&quot; is that you want to tell 80% of humanity that they will never be permitted to achieve the same quality of life we enjoy in Western society today.<p>Good luck with that.

            Not only that but the West must also regress, that is correct. That is pretty much obvious once you have accepted that current growth is unsustainable and has been for a long time.<p>But we can (and probably will) keep pretending, that&#x27;s fine, it will just be more and more &quot;to late&quot; and we&#x27;ll cause more and more irreversible damage.<p>There is no green growth.<p>Heck, I shouldn&#x27;t care, I have no children and a comfortable life.

            is there somewhere a summary of “basic science” problems that need to be solved to make fusion feasible? 
And - would throwing more money at the problem?

            This book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simonandschuster.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;The-Star-Builders&#x2F;Arthur-Turrell&#x2F;9781982130664" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simonandschuster.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;The-Star-Builders&#x2F;Art...</a> just came out and is a very accessible explainer.<p>The maybe-tldr version: we can make fusion occur, but it currently (well, until today) takes more energy to make it happen than we get out. We have good models that predict this relationship, and it mostly boils down to maximizing the &quot;triple product&quot;: temperature times plasma density times confinement time. The two most popular broad approaches are &quot;magnetic confinement&quot; (holding a plasma for awhile with magnetic fields) and &quot;inertial confinement&quot; (taking a capsule and rapidly mechanically compressing it, with lasers or a railgun or something, which is what this NIF thing is), and each chooses to maximize the triple product by leaning on different multiplicands -- inertial confinement is much shorter time, but higher density as compared to magnetic. For both, the other factor is plasma instabilities: plasmas don&#x27;t like to behave, and like to leak out of their enclosures or not maintain the shapes you want them to, and lots of research seems to be about controlling those.<p>Beyond that, what the challenges are depend on the approach you choose. For inertial, bumping up the triple product seems to be mostly about building bigger and more powerful systems, and managing plasma instabilities. NIF also uses an &quot;indirect&quot; approach where the lasers get (inefficiently) turned into X-rays which then compress the plasma, and &quot;direct&quot; inertial fusion has even bigger plasma instability problems to solve.<p>For magnetic, the most mature technologies, tokamaks, have well-understood properties in terms of plasma management, and the main still-to-do work had been thought to just be making the machines bigger, which is what ITER is doing, but the recent change is the development of high-temperature superconducting magnets, which might allow for much higher-strength magnetic fields, which would allow for success with smaller machines (that&#x27;s what, e.g., Commonwealth Fusion, is pursuing). In either case, the goal is just bumping up the triple product until we get to net gain. Other magnetic approaches (stellarators, etc.) are probably at a somewhat-earlier stage of understanding plasma behavior.<p>For both inertial and magnetic, there will also be development needed after net energy gain to get enough of a gain factor that the economics actually make sense and things can be mass-produced (current thinking is that to actually be economical, we need to get to ~30x energy out compared to what went in), and also likely some materials-science innovations needed to keep the reactor from wearing out due to high neutron flux, and possibly some work producing tritium, the likely fuel, from lithium.<p>Beyond those MCF and ICF, there are also a bunch of other less-mature technologies that startups are exploring that might also produce good results, and (the founders think) might do so more efficiently than the big approaches, but they&#x27;re not as far along, and the work still to do is more basic-science-ish. This would be things like Z-pinch, fuel cycles other than deuterium-tritium, etc. etc.

            Also, realizing I didn&#x27;t answer the &quot;money&quot; question. Fusion enthusiasts definitely think so, and personally (just random interested lay-person) it seems like for tokamaks in particular, the physics are now well-enough understand that it&#x27;s probably just a matter of money&#x2F;time, but it&#x27;s hard to say for sure.

            Slightly tangential, but this amazing scientific work makes me wonder how much more we could have achieved over the last 30-40 years, had we diverted even a small fraction of military funding to science and space research.  Say, $100B&#x2F;year.<p>LLNL&#x27;s budget is $2.5 billion. The entire Nasa budget is around $25B&#x2F;year; NSF is $8.5B. It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s also military R&amp;D and of course the majority of R&amp;D is private sector[1], but just saying, what a shame that there isn&#x27;t more of a national focus.<p>Not only should we be spending more on civil R&amp;D, but what did we gain from that military expenditure, for example the couple of trillion we poured into Afghan for 20 years?<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncses.nsf.gov&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;nsb20203&#x2F;cross-national-comparisons-of-r-d-performance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncses.nsf.gov&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;nsb20203&#x2F;cross-national-compariso...</a>

            Raising budgets don&#x27;t intrinsically guarantee better results. Would a larger staff of physicists etc. lead to more breakthroughs or quicker results? Or would it just be piddled away in frivolous experiments, nicer Aeron chairs and the like?<p>A physicist friend from NSF told me once that $50 billion would be about right.

            depends on where the bottle necks in the research are. I doubt its man power. its most likely production of the various parts.<p>generally speaking you don&#x27;t get great returns on increasing the number of scientists. you do get great returns by speeding up the production of data.
