            I recommend almost anything else at all other than Zoom.<p>As a security researcher that has reported a number of issues to Zoom, I can say without reservation they are one of the most security negligent companies I ever worked with.<p>It was evident after multiple calls with their team they didn&#x27;t employ anyone strong technically in their US offices and had no idea how to translate security issues, even obvious ones like DNS takeover, to their (I assume China based) eng teams.<p>The software was designed without security as even a thought as many researchers have demonstrated. To this day the clients expect administrative access for no reason. I refuse to install them and tolerate the webapp when people insist on Zoom.<p>A friend and I compiled this list to consider.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;dacruz21&#x2F;dd2480f195f5b48a9ab7af8b41c21404" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;dacruz21&#x2F;dd2480f195f5b48a9ab7af8b41c...</a>

            Zoom has fixed the UX in this business, which is the one thing that matters most™, and which is why they will continue to be successful.<p>It&#x27;s like a restaurant which has the absolute best food by a mile, so they remain in business despite the cockroaches and unfriendly waitstaff.<p>Most customers don&#x27;t really care about privacy and security, they just want to pretend, and as long as they can easily pretend they&#x27;re happy.

            Which UX problem do you think it fixed? If I had to rate by the ability to successfully start a call and not have technical issues interrupt it, I&#x27;d rank Zoom, Teams, Slack, and Google Meet roughly equivalent — the quality isn&#x27;t as good or robust as Facetime but that&#x27;s also not designed for meetings or cross-platform.<p>I&#x27;d accept Google self-selecting out of the market with their incoherent messaging strategy but that has nothing do with UX other than not needing to tell people to uninstall the old apps and install the current one.

            When Zoom first came onto the scene, the other technologies you&#x27;ve listed had more friction than coarse grained sandpaper. Zoom was the very first to let people join meetings without a) signing up; and b) downloading anything. I don&#x27;t know about all the solutions you&#x27;ve listed, but Google Meet for example still requires an account whereas Zoom still does not.<p>As more and more people use Zoom, the friction of using it decreases as well, since you can more safely assume that people have used it before and are familiar with it - if not, they can still use it without making an account, and without downloading anything (though this has become a bit harder now).<p>Furthermore, Zoom was also one of the first solutions to let you simply call in with your phone (and put that option front and center), which also does not require accounts or any downloads.<p>There are probably many other things I&#x27;m glossing over here - UX is a holistic phenomenon after all, and requires many small things to feel right. I&#x27;m not sure whether you&#x27;re arguing that Zoom did not have 10x better UX than anything out there when it launched, but if you are, I can&#x27;t help but think you&#x27;re being willfully ignorant.

            &gt; Zoom was the very first to let people join meetings without a) signing up; and b) downloading anything<p>I find your second part interesting because for years Zoom has tried to force you to download their client — you have to learn how to construct the web URL to generate links to use it in a browser since they removed the option from their web UI.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure whether you&#x27;re arguing that Zoom did not have 10x better UX than anything out there when it launched, but if you are, I can&#x27;t help but think you&#x27;re being willfully ignorant.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re inclined to take such an uncharitable view but I&#x27;m coming at it from the perspective of someone who was relatively late to using Zoom (2020) and found it pretty similar to the competition. I used Skype, WebEx, Teams, Hangouts&#x2F;Meet, and Chime professionally first and Facetime &#x2F; Hangouts personally prior to that and the only one I&#x27;d say is 10x worse is Skype.

            Re: join via web, in my experience if you reject the download a few times it&#x27;ll pop up the link. Clearly a dark pattern attempting to force you to install their insecure and frankly kind of crappy software, but apparently one they&#x27;re aware of problems with. They just don&#x27;t care.

            I used Zoom yesterday after months and I had to download the client. I was in hurry because a customer sent me a link so I didn&#x27;t investigate much. They usually make calls on Slack which works well and already has all of their conversations.<p>WebEx used to be a nightmare with a Java client. Maybe it&#x27;s better now but I didn&#x27;t use it for years on a computer. I had an Android tablet with the WebEx app and I used that. Luckily no customer of mine is using WebEx anymore.<p>I never used Chime and never heard about it until now.<p>Skype doesn&#x27;t have URLs AFAIK. I used it with a small group of friends during lockdowns because it was the intersection of what all of them had. We rejoined the same call every time. It works well once started. Cumbersome to start.<p>Meet has the least friction: create a call, send a URL, click&#x2F;tap to join. I don&#x27;t remember if a Google account is required but everybody has one in this part of the world because of Android. It works well.<p>Teams has a mandatory download AFAIK, I got a customer that uses it. It works well once started. I have no idea if I can start a call without an Office 365 account. I remember that it asks me to login to that customer&#x27;s Office.<p>FaceTime, never used because it&#x27;s an Apple only thing. I don&#x27;t have the hardware.<p>Duo, I think it improved since its launch but despite being in the phones everybody uses here, everybody makes call with WhatsApp. I think Google lost the network effect battle.<p>WhatsApp is the easiest to start a call with but no URLs, no calls on the desktop. The quality is not very good, maybe because people can have poor connections on their phones (mobile data or crowded WiFi channels.)<p>Telegram added group calls recently but I never used them. Network effects again and at least 10 times less market penetration. One to one calls where on par with WhatsApp.

They try and manipulate you into using the app with their constant &quot;Get the app&quot; splash screens, though.

            Zoom certainly invested millions in marketing before and during the pandemic. Airports were plastered with zoom advertisement. I truly believe marketing and a simple ordering process account for a huge part of zoom&#x27;s success, not features or UX.

            Jitsi was awful. So it’s a combo. Zoom wouldn’t be where it is if it was Jitsi. I used Jitsi from 2018-2020. So many problems with it. You won’t find anywhere close to the polarizing views of the actual usability or Jitsi compared to Zoom or any other better app in any niche.

            Both.<p>Honestly - there&#x27;s huge, massive room for better UX that would really revolutionize online communication:<p>- Presence indicator&#x2F;avatar in your toolbar of close contacts or team<p>- Push-to-talk to send audio to anyone from toolbar with non-disruptive indicator<p>- Instant screen&#x2F;mouse share from there with audio and floating video optional<p>- Just so many fluidity improvements if you do a more minimal video window that can add&#x2F;remove people without friction<p>I really wish someone would build it.

            Pre-pandemic, I used both Bluejeans and (Blackboard.com&#x27;s) Collaborate  Ultra.
Bluejeans already let you use your phone years before. Neither required an account for anyone but meeting organiser. Collaborate Ultra doesn&#x27;t even have a native app (as far as I know), it only has a web app.<p>I have no idea why so many folks like Zoom; I find it to be less useful than either. E.g. using external monitor with different resolution is handled very poorly.

            It’s tight integration with calendar systems and Slack definitely help. Their browser extension makes Google Calendar event creation have a Zoom Meeting link that is seamless, and &#x2F;zoom is irresistible. For a time they had the best free tier on the market, and people appreciated the 45 minute time limit that came along with it.<p>FWIW the competition was terrible for a time. I’ve never been on a BlueJeans call that wasn’t painful, Google Meet&#x2F;Hangouts had terrible quality, GoToMeeting was neglected post-acquisition, slack killed their meeting product for a while, and WebEx was bloated. Join.me was my goto for a while, but now I use Jitsi when I get to choose, but usually end up on Zoom calls.

            I think a lot of it is that everyone has heard of Zoom, and Zoom works pretty well for calls with a lot of people, so it became the default for group video calls.<p>The “UX” in this case was “fixed” by being less crashy than the competition for long enough to earn a reputation.<p>As someone with a security background myself, I really hope organizations use it less and less, because the competition by now works just fine.  But as a human living in the world, I don’t refuse to use Zoom, I just use it on my iPad and assume the conversation is intercepted somewhere.

            I can tell you that this is pretty much everyone.

            I&#x27;ve got to agree with the GP on this. I would argue Zoom is one of the least simple to understand UIs.<p>- It&#x27;s multi-window (like WebEx). Whereas Teams and Meets is a single window interface<p>- It has a great many options and not all of them are immediately obvious. Like how filters are hidden behind then stop cam button<p>I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m a fan of MS Teams nor Google Meets either. But they do have a much slicker UI.

            That&#x27;s not been my experience.

            completely disagree. The <i>pandemic</i> was the sea change toward mass videoconferencing. Zoom just surfed the wave significantly better than others, thanks to good marketing and a simple ordering process.

That doesn&#x27;t wallpaper over the history here, but there is completely different security leadership (e.g the current CISO didn&#x27;t start until late June 2020 [2]) and staffing in place at this point that means your statements on their team likely aren&#x27;t reflective of Zoom today.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.zoom.us&#x2F;ceo-report-90-days-done-whats-next-for-zoom&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.zoom.us&#x2F;ceo-report-90-days-done-whats-next-for-...</a>

            It is easy to say &quot;we are better now, we promise&quot;. They straight up lied about security features like e2e for years, and leadership is still mostly the same. They only started seriously hiring in security because they got caught over and over and over.<p>I have worked with companies with some of the best security people in the world who had no cooperation from engineering to roll out basic risk reductions like code review because it might mean slowing down velocity a bit. To be blunt, security people as often hired with big pairs of golden handcuffs in order to make security marketing more believable, regardless of the reality.<p>The only way to win back trust of the security minded at this point, is to do what strong competitors like BigBlueButton and Jitsi did: Open source, and invite anyone from the public to audit code and compile binaries as they like.<p>There is virtually 0 chance they ever do this, but if they did, I would gladly audit it for free out of public interest, and have no problem doing a 180 and actively recommending zoom if it becomes easy to verify it is as good or better than the competition at security and privacy.<p>For now I maintain my position of strongly urging all my clients to abandon Zoom in favor of historically honest and highly accountable alternatives that work just as well as Zoom without constantly pestering users to grant Zoom with blind sweeping remote code execution privileges on their systems.

            I agree that <i>company culture</i> is something that goes top down and you do not change by simply swapping out the security team. Zoom has (had?) a culture of wilful negligence, taking dangerous shortcut (they are the only company whose mess Apple had to fix themselves with security patch for god sake – I still can&#x27;t believe this one actually), etc.<p>I might be pessimistic but I don&#x27;t think such a culture is something you can correct very easily, because it is anchored at the very top of the company.

            Offer a comparable alternative, then. I spend half my day on meetings either internally or with clients, and every time I have to jump on a client meeting with Microsoft Teams&#x2F;Google Hangouts&#x2F;WebEx&#x2F;GotoMeeting because their company bans Zoom, it&#x27;s a recipe for a fruitless meeting. Someone will fumble the sharing controls; screens will take forever to present; at least one person&#x27;s microphone will become inaudible, static-y, or suffer from &quot;robot voice slow-down&quot; lag.<p>To say nothing of the clusterf*ck that happens when two company-specific instances of Microsoft Teams try to communicate with each other and I&#x27;m left with a bunch of orphaned chatrooms with outside personnel after the meeting concludes.

            AdmiralAsshat&#x27;s point was that all of the alternatives sucked because they were difficult or flakey to use: they weren&#x27;t &quot;comparable&quot;. Notably, the alternatives being mentioned as non-comparable weren&#x27;t even trying to be local: they were remote service&#x2F; (which if you think Zoom is particularly bad, is still an improvement) built by giant companies that have tons of resources to have an army working on just these tools... and they all still sucked.<p>You then responded to this comment by just matter-of-factly asserting that you had the list of missing alternatives... but, really, you are simply hijacking the thread to point out that alternatives exist &quot;which allows all the data to remain on your own servers&quot;; but, you provide no evidence or argument to address whether these products are actually &quot;comparable&quot; (to the point where it just feels like you didn&#x27;t even understand the point being made) in a way that, say, Google Hangouts--which is the product Google created WebRTC for!--isn&#x27;t.

            Like all apps that are &quot;just&quot; WebRTC, jitsi doesn&#x27;t work well on networks with persistently high packet loss. A VC app needs to work reliably 99.99% of the time, not just 99% of the time.

            Agreed. I suggested Jitsi to a few university professors early in the pandemic last year. They used it for a good 6 months, with classes of about 20 people, 2-3 times a week.<p>The experience of not having to login and fuss with accounts was great. However, when everyone had their cameras on + screen sharing, audio quality typically suffered.<p>These professors since moved on to use Zoom and it’s way more stable. I don’t like Zoom generally (for many of the reasons noted in this thread), but it’s definitely reliable.

            This is basically trading one reliability issue for another. The one chosen by the professor is reliable in excluding some students, the ones who actually care about their privacy, from the conferences.

            I disagree that alternatives are flakey or difficult to use. If anything it&#x27;s the opposite. I use BBB daily (and sometimes Jitsi) with a very varied group (including people who never had a computer before) and the results are <i>much</i> better than with Zoom. Maybe Zoom is intuitive if you grew up with computers and with bad software, but honestly the quasi-requirement of installation (it&#x27;s non-trivial to use the web version) and the dark patterns galore are hard to navigate for non-techy people.

            It is a complete video conferencing package by itself, so you generally don&#x27;t need anything else. It just works out of the box to give you multi-party video conferencing across multiple rooms.<p>We use it in our (closed source) online tutoring &#x2F; whiteboard software, and it is pretty easy to integrate, by taking their videoroom sample code.<p>What is it you&#x27;re looking for?

            BBB was a mess. It&#x27;s security and privacy may be great on paper (open source, self hosted).

            I like your line reasoning… but the problem with video conferencing isn’t really technical- IMO it’s all about the User experience (UX).  Zoom by far beats the competition in this regard.  It’s UI could be better but compared the mess of competitors it’s far more straightforward … just my opinion…

            I don&#x27;t think Zoom &quot;beats&quot; anyone in UX, especially with the dark patterns. They&#x27;re just popular. I&#x27;ve seen countless times hundreds of people unable to activate the &quot;Computer Audio&quot; option on company-wide meetings because it&#x27;s in a secondary tab with zero-affordance. Recently they made it very hard to find the &quot;gallery mode&quot; icon (you have to hover a dark area). They also make it borderline impossible to open it on the browser, forcing multiple reloads or whatnot (the method it changes all the time). Honestly Jitsi, BBB and even Teams are all better IMO.

            One of my pet-peeves with the zoom UX is that it always switches to full-screen mode if someone is sharing the screen. This is particularly annoying if you are also using the participant or chat windows (because there&#x27;s voting or chat messages etc.) and if you are switching between different presenters (meaning it switches again and again to full screen). Why can&#x27;t it respect my decision to not have a full-screen window?!

            As someone who runs Zoom via the browser (they do deploy a dark pattern to discourage this behavior but there is no good reason to trust them) I find that Hangouts and Teams are both solid alternatives in terms of AV quality. Would be happy to see some actual data on this claim.<p>People prefer the interface they are used to. I personally find Zoom to be really frustrating from an interface angle but that is probably just familiarity. Of course Zoom could have avoided such issues had they been more  conscious of ethics.

            The web UI is severely limited compared to the desktop client which is why I suspect they do this (even though I disagree with it).<p>I&#x27;ve had some very confusing meetings because I worked at a company that required us to use web, but the presenter wasn&#x27;t and what she was seeing didn&#x27;t match us which led to some confusing scenarios. Things like the grid view weren&#x27;t there last I used it and some of the more advanced presenter features just don&#x27;t do anything for web iirc

            I really liked Bluejeans (I find its audio&#x2F;video quality to be far superior to the alternates) but it really didn&#x27;t do well over jittery&#x2F;slow connections. Zoom swept in and through people&#x27;s refusal to use anything but what they&#x27;re familiar with it chased out Bluejeans and we got rid of it.

            Perhaps I am jaded, but as of yet I have never used a browser-based video chat that worked well. Invariably connection issues arise which I have only rarely experienced with Zoom. My best explanation is that a native app has more to work with in terms of codecs and connection management than a browser can offer.<p>So to this end, that &quot;dark&quot; pattern is ultimately to a user&#x27;s benefit and they are truly better off if they use the native app. If Zoom did not do this, they would pay the cost in terms of support and perceptions that the service is not reliable, in much the same way that Hangouts is unusable.<p>Having said that, you should be able to acknowledge that you do want to use the browser and don&#x27;t want to see the pattern again.

            This dark pattern may benefit some users, however there is a trade-off between video quality and data security. Different users have different preferences&#x2F;needs between these two aspects of a video call service. Tricking people into selecting one option is rarely done out of concern for the interests of the end user.
I would personally be much more convinced that I am benefiting from installing an app that has a history of data security issues if they gave a clear and up front explanation of why this benefits me.<p>FWIW, my work uses Google Meet running through Chrome and it gets the job done for remote collaboration. 
I would actually be curious to see some figures on the difference in performance between Browser and Desktop. I imagine that you can do a few tricks for compression and buffering on with a native app that would not be possible on a browser, but I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in terms of my ability to have a meeting.

            Hangouts is all but dead, and Chat&#x2F;Meet suck by comparison... at one point, I loved Hangouts, one comms app to rule them all, SMS, chat, video conf, messaging, even google voice... then it all fell apart.<p>Half the time, I can&#x27;t join a meet with video, or the video works in the &quot;test&quot; window, but as soon as you join it&#x27;s broken.<p>I&#x27;m mostly okay with Teems though.

            Browser zoom drops my audio after several minutes making me disable and reenable audio to get a few more minutes of audio. Annoying when it happens mid sentence, but that&#x27;s a price you have to pay for using Zoom.

            &gt; As someone who runs Zoom via the browser (they do deploy a dark pattern to discourage this behavior but there is no good reason to trust them) I find that Hangouts and Teams are both solid alternatives in terms of AV quality. Would be happy to see some actual data on this claim<p>Some anecdata, recently i had to switch from Teams to Zoom, with the same person, and the audio quality was drastically better on Zoom for both of us.

            As someone how uses both Zoom and Google Hangouts, there is nothing Zoom offers that Google hangouts does not provide. The quality is the same for both, but at least Hangouts does not install a sketchy client on my machine that constantly runs in the background.

            My 94 year old grandpa would constantly struggle with zoom, to the point that we&#x27;d schedule him 15 minutes early to avoid half the meeting being about zoom problems.  Hangouts worked well for him first try.  The auto captioning also works quite a bit better with hangouts, which is good for people with hearing loss.

            Google hangouts is garbage. I have never had a hangout call that didn’t freeze or have someone dropout.

            Likewise - we switched from Gotomeeting to Google Meet (which is the same as hangouts, right?) mostly because the experience for staff in Latin America was so much better.<p>That said, Gotomeeting is the worst of the bunch. They haven&#x27;t added a  useful feature in years, the CPU usage is terrible, their parasitic launcher is very difficult to get rid of, ugh... I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re still around.

            Screen sharing on hangout (a year or so ago) has been terrible for me, especially for text dense screens like code. Pair programming on hangouts I can&#x27;t even read the other person&#x27;s code a lot of the time. Also hangout quality for video and audio drops really fast on relatively poor quality network. I&#x27;ve had a few cases where the quality on hangout was too poor so we switch over to zoom.

            Easy to self-host and probably less expensive to host than all the MS Office licenses used for MS Teams or paid Zoom licenses. I set up Jitsi Meet months ago and all I ever had to do was to add user accounts using prosody on the server (which should be improved imo). I&#x27;ve not needed to touch anything since first setup, except for user accounts. It just works. What&#x27;s more is, that some solutions like MS Teams still is not able to properly work on all browsers. While Discord has solved this problem for ages and Jitsi Meet simply works in all modern browsers. I have a hunch, that with MS Teams there is active unwillingness to make it work properly. How else can this be explained?

            The 1000 slightly different versions of Webex that are all bundeled under the same brand are its biggest drawback.<p>My university uses it as well, and the normal latest version of Webex is on par with Zoom. However for some courses the lecutrers use e.g. Webex Training which is barely usable garbage (but is the only version that has built-in quiz features).

Looks like Webex added Linux(Deb &amp; RHEL) on May 28, 2021.
Before that, you had to use their legacy java applcation which also necessitated you to *manually* figure out, then hunt down &amp; install the missing dependencies. And it was still shit.

            I have to do many online meetings, with attendants from developing countries (like mine) or unstable links. From our experience it seemsthat Zoom tolerates our unstable internet links better. I guess it has better error correction.<p>There&#x27;s also the annotate feature is super useful, which is missing in Teams and Webex. And also offers dial-in phone numbers in more countries then the rest.<p>Zoom&#x27;s audio design is nicer too, compared to Webex has some very annoying beeps that are a pain in large meetings.<p>Regarding Teams, I have a computer with plenty of RAM, SSD disks and a high end work provided smartphone. Teams is super slow in both of them. I haven&#x27;t been able to use the Exe version for weeks now because it&#x27;s too slow. There is also no way to quote a chat using the Windows and Web version, so in order to quote chats I have to do it from my phone.<p>Every once in a while I have buggy Teams or Webex meeting, that ends with a &quot;Hey you know, I&#x27;ll just send you a Zoom link&quot;.

You can&#x27;t demand to change the maw just because software companies want to illegaly collect data from their users.

            100% agree. Data privacy _is_ doable. Yes, it&#x27;s added complexity, but software companies make it out to be much worse than what it actually is — and people believe them. These large software companies just don&#x27;t want the inherent risk associated with saying &quot;I comply with data privacy law XYZ&quot; – because if they actually don&#x27;t because they missed something, they will be sued for a lot of money.

            Although I mainly use zoom for work, I&#x27;ve also used Google Meet occasionally and have found the quality to be on par with Zoom.<p>I notice you mentioned Google Hangouts instead of Google Meet, I&#x27;m not sure if they are the same now (too hard to keep track of these) but a brief google search seems to suggest they are not the same. If so, my past experience with Google Hangouts with friends would suggest it is indeed terrible. If so, you could give Google Meet a try.

            I very much agree with this.<p>Zoom may be terrible from a security point of view; I dislike the fact that I may well have installed spyware on my machines; and I have <i>absolutely no idea</i> why in the nine hells the Android version <i>complains that my phone is rooted</i> (it should exist in a chroot!) but --- despite all of that --- <i>it works</i>.<p>Teams, in particular comparison, is like DIY dentistry with kitchen implements as surgical tools. It lags; it doesn&#x27;t have a native client on any devices and turns them all into heaters; its codecs are nowhere near as good, and it can&#x27;t display as many people on screen at one point in time -- and there&#x27;s no private chat. I understand on one level why most organisations seem to want to force their staff to use Teams – it&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; (if you already pay the microsoft tax) and comes with the corporation (±NSA) being the spying overlord, rather than &quot;E2EE&quot; (+China). However, I <i>completely</i> also understand why most users prefer Zoom. Frankly, I do too!

            Dang, Webex is still that bad for you?  Is it because you&#x27;re using company&#x27;s instances where it&#x27;s more locked down and they&#x27;re on older code?<p>I know it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s pretty reliable for me (and full disclosure, I work for a different subsidiary of Cisco - but I also try to be pretty critical of it since I&#x27;m close to it)<p>I don&#x27;t use Zoom a ton, but I&#x27;ve experienced what feels like a similar amount of sluggishness and AV issues as I have on Webex.

            I found Webex to be quite a lot worse than Zoom in my limited experience. I attended a few IEEE presentations hosted on the platform. Audio didn&#x27;t connect smoothly and needed a few restarts. The talk was constantly interrupted by a chiming noise whenever a person joined or left the meeting. I remember finding a configuration setting for this but the hosts didn&#x27;t see my message (another bad feature), as this was a meeting-wide setting rather than a client one. Even if it were configurable per-user, that chime turned on is an unexpected and intrusive default setting.<p>Beyond that, I couldn&#x27;t see the presented content in full-screen. There was a lot of junk in the form of perpetual UI elements for the &quot;fullscreen mode&quot;.<p>These seemed like pretty fundamental misses for the platform to make.

            this entry beep is a typical example of security vs. usability. The entry beep is meant for everyone to know if someone joined, even if they have joined using a phone only. It is also configurable. I think it was a huge mistake from cisco to make it a default though, the security benefit is too small. In the latest version is is now automatically disabled after 25 participants I believe, so they heard the feedback (took their time though).

            Yeah, it&#x27;s amazing to me the hate people have for Zoom.<p>I feel about Zoom like Garp felt about the plane that hit the house he was looking at buying.  When the real estate agent said he wouldn&#x27;t want to buy it now, he said <i>The odds of another plane hitting this house are astronomical!</i> and bought the house.  I think it&#x27;s unlikely Zoom will jeopardize their leadership by not taking security and privacy seriously.

            I&#x27;ve been a heavy user of GoToMeeting for over a decade. It works very, very well for us, and our use case is entirely multi-org meetings.<p>If someone has shitty home internet (a COVID-era problem), then they should probably dial in separately and not use the meeting audio, but that&#x27;s going to hurt you no matter what meeting tool you use.

            Hangouts would surely have the same problem since I doubt Google can rule out the possibility that your video streams are being relayed through frontend servers outside the EU. The only way you could really control it is to use the old school approach to video conferencing: legacy standards like SIP or h.323 with all of the usability problems that implies, or WebRTC with your own STUN&#x2F;TURN services ... and all of the usability problems that implies.

            Other big services sometimes solve this problem by creating a data center in EU for European customers (DataDog, 1password, etc.). I don’t know how feasible could that be in Zoom’s case technically, but if they see a threat of losing customers because of GDPR they might dedicate such resources.

            I never have issues with Hangouts.  I think Zoom is a slightly better experience, but just making a Calendar invite in Google Calendar, and it automatically having the Hangout meeting is pretty nice.<p>[Edit] Google Meet

            Have not experienced this myself, but it could be due to poor network connectivity.<p>What i find annoying about Teams, is the ability to use 100% CPU and 90% of the integrated graphics on a laptop.<p>Thankfully disabling GPU hardware acceleration have helped quite a lot.

            I feel like I live in a bizzaro world...<p>First, I’ve been working remotely over skype, audio-only, for over a decade.

            I don&#x27;t know - my company&#x2F;team (except for one or two instances of introductions) never expect us to turn on video. Some people do; other don&#x27;t; just do your thing. Turning on the video is especially hard on women. From what I have heard from friends they have to get ready and put on makeup as if they&#x27;re going to work simply because they&#x27;re expected to be on zoom video all day long.

            Talking not as a security researcher but as someone who has to work with large corporate IT departments none of the alternatives proposed in this thread will fly.<p>With corporate IT, it&#x27;s either MS Teams because it&#x27;s installed &quot;by default&quot; on enterprise workstations and managed at the O365 level, or Zoom or Cisco WebEx, all managed centrally by IT.<p>In our experience with these services, Zoom has been more reliable, and the quality of service for video and audio has been generally better than the rest, specially Teams. At the end of the day, this is all that our enterprise users care about.<p>When running calls across organisations, it invariably ends up as a zoom meeting since Teams is flaky for someone, or WebEx doesn&#x27;t allow someone to share their desktop.<p>Another significant but underrated factor is the non-tech and non-enterprise market. Friends and family in their seventies and eighties default to zoom for their weekly or monthly catch-up sessions and get-togethers because &quot;it just works&quot;. My neighbour who&#x27;s in her late seventies is an editor for a small news magazine for the community, and zoom is her choice to collaborate with others on their articles.<p>People <i>don&#x27;t want</i> to bother with security until there&#x27;s a massive breach somewhere, or it affects their business, or it&#x27;s mandated by legislation or certification requirements.

            Also depending on the type of calls you have Google Meet can be a lot more usable.<p>Zoom seems to come from the Seminar&#x2F;Presentation mindset. By default no one can join until the host does, only the host can share their screen and no one except the host can mute other participants. Most of the default ACLs can be relaxed if the organizer changes their default meeting settings but most people won&#x27;t.<p>Google Meet seems to assume some level of trust between the participants which matches my use case much more. So by default anyone can share their screen when they need too and if someone forgets to mute themselves when they take a call someone else can help them out (I have seen a Zoom meeting that had to be abandoned because someone took a call thinking they were on mute.)<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the Zoom defaults are &quot;wrong&quot;. In fact they are the safer defaults. But for my most common use case of a meeting between people in the same company the Meet defaults work much better. (Although it is nice when a meeting gets &quot;canceled&quot; because the organizer is out sick and no one can join &#x2F;s)

            I&#x27;ll give it another shot, but every time I do I&#x27;m not impressed.<p>I&#x27;d love to use Google Meet and save some money but the audio and video quality looks like a cheap trick compared to Zoom. My users complain endlessly about this. We discovered Zoom a few years back because we were desperate to get away from Hangouts.<p>I expect their client does a lot of work around clearing up audio and similar whereas you&#x27;d need to do that on the server-side (and accept the lag) for Google Meet unless you can use WebAsm to clean up the audio stream possibly. I don&#x27;t know if developers have that access.<p>I guess Google could solve this but it would require some considerable resources. I think this is one of those situations where video calls are a hobby for Google but they&#x27;re the entire business for Zoom.

            My son&#x27;s university has been holding tons of virtual sessions for incoming first-year students and their parents.

            For a time in 2020, Zoom for whatever reason had a significant boom of popularity (I suppose they had some freemium option for group calls? I really don&#x27;t know).<p>As a result, a lot of companies bought licenses because Zoom was the cool tech at the time. My company did this, despite there being an official mandate that all official communication&#x2F;calls must go through Teams the year prior†.<p>I think the persistence of Zoom is just whatever the tech equivalent of a hangover is. Everyone binged on Zoom in 2020, and now that we&#x27;re far more comfortable with work from home and have more stable setups, a lot of places are stuck with Zoom licenses. Embarrassingly, our company&#x27;s periodic all-hand-calls still are on Zoom when every other operation is done on Teams. I think our brand team also decided to host a few presentations on Zoom when we presented in the US for the sole reason of &quot;well, it&#x27;s cool.&quot;<p>† I have no love for Teams to be clear, it&#x27;s awful software. I do understand IT&#x27;s mandate though, since the entire point of the mandate was to get people to stop installing random stuff on their work computers, which turned out to be a great idea when it comes to Zoom.

            I have a couple of (honestly not very tech savvy) clients who adopted Zoom at the beginning of the COVID era, and who are absolutely swallowing whatever lies Zoom is telling about security and encryption and whatnot.<p>Zoom has the absolutely BALLS to sell a product called &quot;ZoomGov&quot; they say is more secure or whatever, but who wants to bet it&#x27;s the same code running on different servers? They&#x27;re also claiming HIPAA compliance, which I&#x27;m also certain is a complete lie.<p>They don&#x27;t care. They&#x27;ll say literally anything, and pay whatever fines happen if they get caught.

            Teams comes from free with Office 365.<p>I think last year someone from the accounting department suggested cancelling Zoom because we had meetings already included in Teams.<p>It caused quite a commotion from the Zoom users a few minutes after we learnt about it. The plan was promptly cancelled.

            I have never seen it in a professional setting and I sadly have too many meetings. In my corporate world at least it is almost always teams and people don&#x27;t want to use zoom. Sales might be different though.

            Sounds famliar! I remember attempting to do a meeting with a company that resellls Webex. The meeting was not Webex related but related to another product they sell. We ended up switching to Zoom because Webex wasn&#x27;t working.

            And instead of improving their code so Teams is fast as VS Code, they delegated it to the Edge team to write a new version of Electron called WebView2.<p>Teams&#x27; codebase is apparently so bad that it&#x27;s not fixable and they need to rely on others to rewrite the runtime for them.<p>For good measure it also subscribes to the media keys on the keyboard.

            Slightly tangential - I went to install Keybase on a new Debian build last night, and discovered the installation process is broken, evidently has been for some time, and upstream (on github) seems abandoned.<p>Keybase, once a popular favourite on HN, lost a lot of street cred when Zoom bought them out in early 2020.<p>Zoom and Keybase at the time insisted this was all <i>very good news</i> as it showed Zoom was deeply committed to improving their security posture.<p>Apparently, not so much.

            So this is different than all the other Zoom is insecure things.  This is related to Zoom sending data to a “hostile” state (the US) which cannot guarantee GDPR compliance and there is no waiver to allow transmission of protected data to The US.

            I use Zoom for the simple reason that it provides end to end encryption and can seamlessly support large (50+) team meetings.<p>Other than WebEx, which is more cost-prohibitive and has a clunkier UI&#x2F;UX to boot, I believe there are no other video conferencing apps that can provide the service I&#x27;m looking for (which is 1.

            I&#x27;ve stress tested Jitsi&#x27;s E2EE (both on the official server and on a self-hosted instance, with was a PITA to setup, by the way) and....it does not scale. After more than 20 clients joined, there were noticeable problems that made the meeting impossible to conduct (audio drop outs, frozen video, disparate lag times, etc), both on a self-hosted instance that had more than enough bandwidth&#x2F;hardware kit to handle it (the same self-hosted setup is also used to host Zoom, which runs perfectly), and on their main server.<p>I would like to hear real-world examples of people successfully conducting large-scale E2EE meetings over Jitsi.

            If the option is &quot;not use any closed-source E2EE video conferencing platform because of ideological purity&quot; or &quot;conferencing platform which promises E2EE and has SLAs and legal contracts backing these claims with the client&quot;, for practical purposes the latter wins.

            The parent post said no E2EE for group chat. Telegram doesn&#x27;t seem to support that according to the linked page. Telegram group video chat only allows up to 30 people for the time being, which is far too limited. Also, group chat is not the same as &quot;conferencing platform&quot;.

            If an app which supports groups video calls counts as a &quot;video conferencing platform&quot; in your book, then you&#x27;re better off using either Facetime or Signal, both of which support E2EE, unlike Telegram.
