            I think this should link directly to Git&#x27;s release notes (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;git&#x2F;xmqq1r6touqi.fsf@gitster.g&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;git&#x2F;xmqq1r6touqi.fsf@gitster.g&#x2F;</a>), or the title should be updated to somehow reflect that this is Github&#x27;s blog post about the changes, not Git&#x27;s official announcement.<p>Git is not owned or stewarded by Github, and posts like this  reinforce the common and unfortunate image that it is.

            <i>&gt;I think my previous comment ([...]) highlights why it&#x27;s problematic to link to release notes from an organization that is not the same organization that actually does the work&#x2F;releases.</i><p>You&#x27;re characterization of it being &quot;problematic to link to Github&quot; vs Git&#x27;s official mailing list is overlooking the <i>cause &amp; effect</i> of how stories end up on the front page.  If most readers would prefer more &quot;official&quot; links from domain *.kernel.org, people can <i>submit</i> them, as they have done so in the past.  Examples:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=git%201.%20.kernel.org&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=git%202.%20.kernel.org&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a><p>Of course, after submission, people also need to <i>upvote</i> them.  It&#x27;s wrong (and misleading) to <i>later change</i> a submission linking to Github blog to the kernel.org url.  The upvoters may have found the context and explanations from Github&#x27;s post to <i>be more helpful</i> than the kernel.org post.  (And as stated before, the Github post has the extra bonus of leading readers to the kernel.org release notes.  But the opposite is not true, the kernel.org post does not lead to Github&#x27;s extra explanations about the repack algorithm.)<p>In your opinion, where is the root cause of the &quot;problem&quot; as you call it?  The submitters?  The upvoters?  The HN mods that leave the original thread url unchanged?<p><i>&gt;In this case, GitHub didn&#x27;t mention anything about `send-email`, because it&#x27;s a direct competitor to themselves.</i><p>Hang on... let&#x27;s level set here with some realism and not exaggerate. The &quot;git send-email&quot; is not a <i>&quot;direct&quot;</i> competitor to Github.  Maybe <i>GitLab</i> could be described as a <i>direct</i> competitor.<p>Here&#x27;s a previous thread where some folks don&#x27;t want to mess with send-email because it&#x27;s a hassle with a bunch of replies lecturing them that they&#x27;re doing it wrong:   <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13631069" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13631069</a><p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if those posters&#x27; complaints about send-email are wrong.  The point is that send-email caters to a different type of git user and it&#x27;s not a direct threat to Github at all.<p>Also, if Github was truly worried about users defecting to &quot;git send-email&quot;, why would they deliberately <i>link to the official Git notes that highlights git send-email as the 1st bulllet point</i> ?!?<p>If we entertained your theory that &quot;git send-email&quot; kills Github&#x27;s business model, wouldn&#x27;t they <i>omit the link</i> to keep readers in the dark?

            I agree with the principal, but in practice the mailing list post is pretty inscrutable to me (as a casual git user, maybe more experienced users find it more helpful?) On the other hand the github blog post provides a lot of extra context and explanation around the changes which adds a lot of value to me.

            I also agree in principal and agree that the GitHub post with additional context is nice.<p>But I&#x27;m wondering if this is rather feedback for the Git team to do better release notes (like the GitHub team here) as GitHub will always be biased with their release notes, so it would be better for everyone is the release note from Git were as well.<p>In this particular release, `send-email` is mentioned in the top in the mailing list as it has a new feature.<p>However, GitHub have zero interest in people to use `send-email` as they are basically a competitor to the `send-email` command. So they simply don&#x27;t mention it in their release notes.<p>This is of course bad, and I&#x27;m not sure why they wouldn&#x27;t at least try to remain impartial. But this is why we need the release notes of the Git team to be better.

            I agree, I think changing the title is a better solution than linking to the release notes, but I still think it makes sense to offer extra clarity.<p>The original title of the blog post is &quot;Highlights from Git 2.33&quot; which to me is a bit clearer that this is not release notes or any kind of &quot;official&quot; Git 2.33 announcement but rather someone&#x27;s highlights about Git 2.33.

            There is some discussion of sparse checkouts and &#x27;cone mode&#x27; lower down in the article. Proper support for these is the replacement for LFS.<p>LFS is a hack and a workaround for the fact that git ships the whole thing and requires you to have every copy of every blob from the whole of history.<p>LFS cheats this by storing the big blobs elsewhere and only fetching the ones needed for your checkout. It&#x27;s a giant pain as everyone knows because you&#x27;ve got two sources of data. Instead lots of work is being done on git to remove the &quot;every copy of every blob&quot; requirement. This is in 2 dimensions - only some specified depth of history, and only some subset of the checkout (LFS only helps with the first). Effectively you still only end up fetching the blobs you need from the server for the checkout you&#x27;re doing. That gets the same benefit of LFS but all in core git.

            LFS has much better UX than sparse-checkout and friends. Really, the only pain points are due to its not being built-in to Git.

            There are two main fundamental things that cause problems with LFS:<p>LFS makes a &#x27;centralised&#x27; assumption about Git usage. Git is designed to be decentralised, even if that&#x27;s not how we use it, whereas LFS requires a single central object store. An example of where this is a problem: we do a lot of development for clients. It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to mirror the git repo to their Gitlab and git usually makes it very easy. If you have LFS in your project then you have to jump through a lot of hoops.<p>The second problem is that LFS copies its data exclusively via https. This creates some security complexity if you normally authenticate via SSH.

            Both of those could easily be solved if it were part of git proper, right? I don&#x27;t see why not, or why they wouldn&#x27;t be.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;m going to be sad if the UX we get to replace it is <i>any</i> of the newish&#x2F;cutting-edge Git features, because they&#x27;re damn ugly. In fact, despite how annoying LFS is for being a separate thing and requiring extra effort for server-side support if you&#x27;re self-hosting, given Github and Gitlab (among others) support for LFS, I don&#x27;t see things like sparse-checkout replacing it unless they get a lot nicer to use <i>for that purpose specifically</i>.<p>One thing that might help would be for Git to make distributing &amp; sharing default repo <i>config</i> easy and built-in. Only thing that gets that treatment is the .gitignore. I feel like I need source control for my source control config, sometimes, and, indeed, some software&#x27;s cropped up to do just that for e.g. hooks, but that ought to be built-in and cover more than that. One nice thing about LFS is that there&#x27;s zero client-side config, aside from installing &amp; enabling it (globally, if you like). You don&#x27;t have to pass around lists of LFS-managed files or checkout-patterns or set-up scripts (hope you made them idempotent!) or anything out-of-band.

            Good point about .gitattributes files being another kind that gets passed around—but that doesn&#x27;t help with things the .gitattributes file can&#x27;t capture, which is most things and was part of my point about why making config natively-sharable would be generally nice <i>and also</i> would help to make things like sparse-checkout more useful; and, crucially, LFS Just Works™ <i>without ever having to touch those files manually</i>.<p>A good built-in implementation <i>should</i> do exactly what LFS does, yes. But they don&#x27;t. LFS does, and that&#x27;s part of why it&#x27;s nicer to use <i>for its specific purpose</i> than doing something with shallow clones and sparse checkouts and all the rest. The best way to replace LFS in git itself would be to copy its UI as completely as possible, because <i>it&#x27;s pretty good</i>.<p>Having to install &amp; enable it is a pain, which making it part of git would fix. Having to maintain separate support for it server-side, and a separate transport mechanism, is a pain, which making it part of git at least <i>could</i> fix if the authors wanted to (in fact, I&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be more work <i>not</i> to solve that problem, in implementing it, though it&#x27;d leave vendors who <i>want</i> the two to be significantly separate to fend for themselves)

            I&#x27;m sure it works both ways. If Github was somethingelseHub, somethingelse would be popular. Git started gaining popularity thanks to great UI and communities on github and gitlab.

            That&#x27;s not strictly true. I&#x27;m sure thst GitHub contributed to the awareness of git among and less technically experienced especially in recent years, but use of version control systems has always been the  norm in mid to large codebases and git became popular because it improved greatly on the version control systems that came before it.<p>Another big factor contributing to it&#x27;s popikaroty was that the Linux kernel (that even when git came out was a pretty big codebase already) also used it to great success.<p>The only real credit that can be given to GitHub in my eyes is that it allows individuals to more easily host remote repos.

            Git didn&#x27;t need GitHub to become popular. Torvald&#x27;s name being attached to it is what did that. But GitHub <i>is</i> what gave Git the near monopoly on open source version control that it enjoys today. Once it became more convenient to contribute to open source projects by forking projects on GitHub than to self-host, that created a barrier against using any other version control system. Other version control systems would be much more popular if it weren&#x27;t for GitHub.

            First paragraph of the article:<p>&gt; In a previous blog post, we discussed how GitHub was using a new mode of git repack to implement our repository maintenance jobs. In Git 2.32, many of those patches were released in the open-source Git project<p>It looks like GH needed a better algo for git repack. Implemented a better algo for git repack.

            What I really want from Git, is to be able to have just a single executable for distribution, like `&#x2F;bin&#x2F;git` or `git.exe`. Currently Git is a mishmash of C, Shell (yes really), Python, Perl and who knows what else. I found from my own testing that you can actually make a static native build of the core with a few tweaks, but some big chunks of the project are still in other random languages.

            Git is (has been) in the process of rewriting many shell commands etc in C. There are a few reasons for this, but part of the reason is to make Git more portable.<p>This work is slow, and a lot of the progress seems to be driven by the Google Summer of Code program (sort of like open source interns), so I suspect it will be a while before all the shell scripts are rewritten.

            Actually it is very reasonable to choose the right language for the job, especially for tasks that are not performance-critical.<p>When you are writing and debugging something new, you don’t want it to take forever to get it into a correct state.  When you are maintaining things, you want readable code.  And in an open-source project, you might attract more maintainers if you have code that is more accessible (e.g. simple things appear as simple as they are because they’re scripts, and people familiar with those languages can help even if they are not C programmers).  It is also more likely to work cross-platform.<p>I can imagine a lot of things that would be a very simple few lines of script but a mess to write, debug and read in C code.  This is especially true if you could have (say) relied on a robust, debugged Python standard library function that has existed for years but instead had to do all of that yourself in C “because the project should only be using C”?

            When did C add standard library functions for Vecs and HashMaps? You&#x27;re putting words in his mouth, no one claimed C lacked &quot;robust, debugged standard library functions&quot;.

            The Git project has had at least one full time paid employee (Junio), for over 10 years. In my mind, it&#x27;s not acceptable that what I&#x27;m asking hasn&#x27;t been done yet. Also, shell is about the worst possible language you could use for a large project. If you want to see for yourself, look at the code for git-bisect. Global state spread across like 5 random shell scripts.

            Yes! Also cherry-pick and revert.<p>But specifically, the ORT strategy can cache computed renames across multiple commits being rebased, so the performance benefits are even greater for &quot;git rebase&quot;.
