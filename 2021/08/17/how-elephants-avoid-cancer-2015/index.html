            One theory is that they actually get so many cancers that they fight each other and never reach the stage where they would become harmful for the Elephant. A good video about this was made by Kurzgesagt – <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1AElONvi9WQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1AElONvi9WQ</a>

            Hypertumors aren&#x27;t really a good explanation for Peto&#x27;s Paradox. Yes, larger animals would need larger tumors to kill them, and larger tumors are more likely to develop hypertumors, but even if cancer didn&#x27;t kill a large animal we&#x27;d still expect to see all those &quot;small&quot; tumors that haven&#x27;t yet developed hypertumors.<p>Further, Peto&#x27;s paradox doesn&#x27;t just apply to large organisms: small creatures get higher cancer rates. You&#x27;d expect there to be some threshold below which the odds of a hypertumor developing are incredibly low, and all organisms that can be killed by tumors smaller than this threshold would have a cancer incidence rate proportional to body mass. At the same time there should be some threshold where a hypertumor is basically guaranteed, above which cancer deaths would simply stop regardless of body mass. Instead, cancer rate is independent of body mass across the spectrum.<p>Then, the lack of correlation between cancer rates and body mass only applies between species. Within a single species, animals with more body mass do have higher rates of cancer and vice versa. This is directly contradictory to what we&#x27;d expect if cancer suppression was a result of increased body mass.<p>Finally, closely related to Peto&#x27;s Paradox is the fact that longer lived species have lower per-cell division cancer rates than shorter lived species. Animals with different lifespans but of the same bodymass can be killed by tumors of the same size, so you need some explanation other than hypertumors (which occur as a function of the size of the tumor) to explain this observation.<p>Evolutionary adaptations that limit cancer are both a simpler and better explanation for these observations. Every animal is going to have some threshold in its life by which it is likely to have passed on its genes, and another threshold beyond which it is unlikely to better pass down its genes. Any gene that kills you before the first threshold is going to be strongly selected against, any gene that keeps you alive after the second threshold isn&#x27;t going to have much selective pressure supporting it. A mouse in the wild can successfully pass on its genes in 3 months and is unlikely to live past 18 months due to injury and predation. While mice under ideal conditions in captivity have lived for up to 6 years, a gene that helps mice suppress cancer when they&#x27;re 5 years old isn&#x27;t doing wild mice any favors. On the other end of the spectrum, blue whales take a minimum of 16 years to reach genetic breakeven, and realistically given their distribution it could easily take much longer. A mutation that causes a 5 year old whale to get fatal cancer will never get passed on to offspring. We should logically expect that any species will continue to evolve cancer defense mechanisms up until the point at which cancer is no longer the limiting factor for passing on their genes, at which point evolution stops selecting for further improvements.

            This is a very strong point. It puts some rationalization behind my intuition that hyper tumors are not a correct explanation, it emphasizes the strength of the gene explanation and this consistent with OP’s article.

            There are two things here. Title capitalization is definitely a part of English orthography. Any book you take, no matter what English-speaking country the author is from, will always use title case, unless it wants to make a point (avant-garde etc.).<p>However, there are differences as to what deserves to be capitalized. Just the titles of books, films, etc? What about the titles of articles, are they in any way different, or maybe worse than the titles of books etc.? I guess this need for consistency pervades the American usage, codified in the CMoS and other style guides, and hence applied universally.

            On the contrary it has nothing to do with grammar, and I relate it to click-bait because it&#x27;s so frequently done by such articles by BuzzFeed and the like; with much more prevalence than among things I actually want to read.<p>It is typically a signal that I <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to read something, which makes it especially confusing on HN, which is generally a list of things I <i>do</i> want to read.

            I wondered about this the other day and didn&#x27;t get much of an answer:<p>Are there first-hand research studies where we take a large sample of some animal (whales &#x2F; mole rats &#x2F; whatever) and check the animals for cancer?<p>Apart from the thought experiment of Peto&#x27;s paradox, has someone actually taken the time and effort to document this? I&#x27;d be interested in reading some papers.

            If this &quot;brute approach&quot;[1] of having multiple copies of a gene manages to prevent cancer, imagine what some (human) intelligent design can achieve.<p>[1] Gene duplication is common in nature, and it&#x27;s one of the main mechanisms by which new genes with different functions evolve.

            I&#x27;m imagining that our intelligence will lead us to an elegant solution that initially appears to work but later proves to have catastrophic unintended side effects. Maybe just copying genes is enough? That brute force approach might be smarter than it appears, given how incredibly common it is in nature. A key thing is that the copies can repair themselves off each other. The more copies that are available, the more robust the system is to error. That&#x27;s part of why humans have their ribosomal DNA in super high copy number in five psuedo-homologous regions on the short arms of our acrocentric chromosomes. The genome keeps lots of copies of the most important stuff. For humans, cancer wasn&#x27;t so important, until recently. So we might need to accelerate things and increase our tumor suppressor copy number. It works for people with trisomy-21.

            Genetic engineering will be our only hope precisely because modern medicine is disregarding our evolution. Lots of bad mutations are being passed down because we can treat them, which of course allows people to live a good life.

            In humans, a defect in the TP53 gene that leads to genetic predisposition to cancer is called Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.  It explains a lot of people who have a strong family history of cancer or those who get it early in childhood.
