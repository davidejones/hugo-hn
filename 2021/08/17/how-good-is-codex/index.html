            Wasn&#x27;t the whole idea behind OpenAI that it would actually be &quot;open&quot;?  Or is the name of the organization now entirely a misnomer?<p>Not only are they not releasing Codex (and GPT-3), but in order to get access to the API you have to apply for access and be judged against a proprietary set of criteria that are entirely opaque.<p>Furthermore, I imagine that if you do any innovative work building on top of Codex (or GPT-3) they would control that work product, they would be able to cut you off from accessing your work product at any time if it suits them, and they would be able to build off of your work themselves, co-opting any unique value that you may create.<p>Why the hell should anyone building an AI business even want to work with them?  Sure, it might accelerate your effort right at the beginning, but if you are unable to reproduce your results outside of their platform, you will always be beholden to them.<p>In a few years will we be reading stories about unfortunate entrepreneurs who had built their businesses on top of OpenAI only to have the rug pulled out from under them, like Amazon sellers whose product was cloned by Amazon Basics, or Twitter clients cut off from the API, or iOS apps made redundant by their core functionality being copied by Apple, or search-driven businesses circumvented by the information cards that Google displays directly in the search results...?  Etc, etc.<p>Am I missing something here?

            OpenAI transitioned from non-profit to for-profit in 2019, took about $1 billion from Microsoft (there has been speculation that this was mostly in the form of Azure credits), and announced that Microsoft would be their preferred partner for commercializing OpenAI technologies: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;</a><p>The name is now a complete misnomer.<p>There may still be some benefit for researchers to collaborate with them (same as with any of the other corporate research labs), but anyone trying to build a business on non-public APIs should obviously tread carefully.<p>So, no.

As far as I can tell they are just collecting email addresses to gauge interest, and are not even evaluating people who cold-apply through their form.<p>Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, though, I only know what I&#x27;ve heard within my own network! It&#x27;s totally possible they&#x27;re allowing a very <i>very</i> slow trickle of external unconnected people in.

            They started as a non-profit and sort of claimed they would actually be open:<p>&quot;As a non-profit, our aim is to build value for everyone rather than shareholders. Researchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work, whether as papers, blog posts, or code, and our patents (if any) will be shared with the world. We’ll freely collaborate with others across many institutions and expect to work with companies to research and deploy new technologies.&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-openai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-openai&#x2F;</a><p>However, a couple paragraphs down might have been a clue to the likely future: &quot;Sam, Greg, Elon, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research are donating to support OpenAI.&quot;<p>Currently they are not really non-profit and mostly working with Microsoft.

            They needed money in order to compete with Google and Facebook, so they switched the model to &quot;investors make a maximum of 10x return and after that they lose their stake&quot; or something like that.<p>As for being open, I think keeping potentially dangerous tech private for a while while openly sharing the results of research is prudent. The last thing I want is some AI model goes public then we find a way to generate a bunch of computer viruses or propaganda.

            I think it&#x27;s maximum of 100x return. So, it&#x27;s for profit with practically unlimited return.<p>&gt; Returns for our first round of investors are capped at 100x their investment (commensurate with the risks in front of us), and we expect this multiple to be lower for future rounds as we make further progress.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;openai-lp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;openai-lp&#x2F;</a>

            Agreed that not releasing models might be a good thing, I&#x27;m just pointing out that&#x27;s not how they initially pitched the organization. I wonder if they might have gotten less favorable publicity when they launched if they just said &quot;we&#x27;re starting an AI company to compete with Google&quot;.<p>As for the business model, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it in principle, it&#x27;s just not what they said they would do. There&#x27;s no reason a well-funded nonprofit research organization needs to compete with Google and Facebook. They changed their funding model because they wanted to compete, not because they needed to. And it hasn&#x27;t been very long since they said &quot;Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact.&quot; You have to assume they knew from the start that they&#x27;d probably want to pivot to a business.

            This is how America was conceived as well. Democracy was not meant to be universal and there were checks placed even on the limited portion of society who could vote.<p>The electoral college, for example, is set up this way. The idea is that electors—who were not democratically elected—could block a populist candidate.<p>As we saw in 2016, this check failed.

            Not the same.  Lenin believed in a democracy of not more than 8 or so people.  The bolsheviks won the Soviet elections and Lenin still staged a coup.<p>The American Constitution is an indirect democracy.  Direct at the local level, indirect at the Federal level (though eventually by statute and amendment it became direct for Congress).<p>&gt; As we saw in 2016, this check failed.<p>Nonsense.  That &quot;failure mode&quot; was designed for.  It has happened a few times.  Working as expected.

            So what it sounds like is that using Codex to write code is like replacing your computer with an intern: can write plausible-looking code and commit messages, but needs constant close attention from an experienced engineer to stop it from turning into a bug machine.

            I find it funny and concerning that you must prompt the model to do an SQL insert &#x27;safely&#x27; to avoid injection vulnerabilities.

            My guess is the end result of all this &quot;AI&quot; assisted code-generation is that it will have the same impact on the software engineering industry as spreadsheets had on accounting. I also believe that this AI-powered stuff is a bit of a &quot;two-steps forward, one step back&quot; situation and the real innovation will begin when ideas from tools like Louise [1] are integrated into the approach taken in Codex.<p>When VisiCalc was released departments of 30 accountants were reduced to 5 accountants because of the improvement for individual worker efficiency, however accounting itself remains largely unchanged and accountants are still a respected profession who perform important functions. There&#x27;s plenty of programming problems in the world that simply aren&#x27;t being solved because we haven&#x27;t figured out how to reduce the burden of producing the software; code generation will simply increase the output of an individual software developer.<p>The same forces behind &quot;no-code&quot; are at work here. In fact I see a future where these two solutions intermingle: where &quot;no-code&quot; becomes synonymous with prompt-driven development. As we all know, however, these solutions will only take you so far -- and essentially only allow you to express problems in domains that are already well-solved. We&#x27;re just expressing a higher level of program abstraction; programs that generate programs. This is a good thing and it is not a threat to the existence of our industry. Even in Star Trek they still have engineers who fix their computers...<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stassa&#x2F;louise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stassa&#x2F;louise</a>

            Good take but I&#x27;m not convinced. I would suspect (see epistemic status) that while correctness is easy to reason about and maintain by a single accountant using spreadsheets, since there is a clean mapping from a precise excel api to function, the mapping from natural language to code is problematic. I won a t-shirt in the recent OpenAI codex challenge and found it hard to reason systemically about the behavior and generalization properties of generated code. When the generated code is wrong, it was frustrating on a different level than if I wrote the code myself.<p>Epistemic status: I don&#x27;t know anything about accounting
