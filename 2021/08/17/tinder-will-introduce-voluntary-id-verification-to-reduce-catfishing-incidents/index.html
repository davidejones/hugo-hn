            Can someone explain to me how Tinder has such a bot problem?<p>I&#x27;m not a Tinder user, but the impression I get is that there is an epidemic of bots such that people have to start conversations with silly &quot;Captcha&quot; type tests. Is this impression correct and there is a bot problem? And if so, how has Tinder not fixed that already?! It&#x27;s not a particularly hard problem to kill off all but the most determined bots. Or are they not motivated to do so due to it inflating user numbers?

            It&#x27;s a big problem. 99% of matches for me (a straight white male, late 20&#x27;s) are bots or people pushing some onlyfans account.

            I am an automation hobbyist and single guy on tinder, and I think I can crack the code on this one: Activity difference<p>On top of you doing the math on how active a bot is verse regular humans, some additional probably related factors are:
- Bot accounts use attractive photos
- Bot accounts can claim to be anywhere
- Bot accounts are often new accounts, and new accounts get boosted
- The longer you use the app, you run out of actual people to swipe on, but the new bot accounts continue to pop up at the same rate - making their % of your total swipe pool increase over time.  
- Bots might just be masking the reality that there isnt many people in your area using the app lately.<p>All that said, in my region of NY I would not consider it a problem at all.  maybe this is not a problem for me because my area is very populated, so there&#x27;s a lot of actual people on the app.

            &gt;Can someone explain to me how Tinder has such a bot problem?<p>It&#x27;s a feature. All dating apps&#x2F;websites go through the same 3 part lifecycle. At any given time, there is only one &quot;hip&quot; service that everyone is using and that attracts all of the tier 1 members (i.e. attractive women) to use exclusively. Right now, that app is Hinge. Before Hinge took off, it was Bumble. And before that it was Tinder. The app that occupies this top space is generally able to get there by optimizing for the female experience, to the complete detriment of the male experience because men will always go where the attractive women are, and they will put up with anything because of that.<p>As a new service comes along and takes all the tier 1 users, the previous front runner drops to the second part of its&#x27; lifecycle. This is where there&#x27;s still a modicum of tier 1 users left, enough to give an impression of vitality to the community and continue pulling in the new users (desperate single men) who will pay for the service&#x27;s extra features in hopes of finding someone. Bumble currently occupies this space. At this second part of the lifecycle, there becomes a strong incentive to start balancing out the UX optimization between male and female, because you&#x27;re no longer in the growth stage and need to start extracting revenue.<p>Finally, once a new service again comes along that displaces the current number one, the original number one drops to the third part of its&#x27; lifecycle. This is where Tinder is now. At that point, it has completely lost relevance to all tier 1 users, but it&#x27;s able to continue along in a zombified state based on its&#x27; previous reputation and the purposefully allowed proliferation of bots that create an illusion of vitality. This is honestly where dating apps make the most money, even if the service itself is terrible. You have no mandate to continue innovating or providing good customer service, and you can totally optimize for the male experience (which is far more profitable) because there are no real women left.<p>source: Worked for $large_dating_app in the mid-2010s

            Isn&#x27;t Tinder aimed mainly at hookups and Bumble&#x2F;Hinge at relationships? While I&#x27;ve not used any of them it feels surprising to hear that most of the attractive women on Tinder moved to Hinge and then again to Bumble.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s still any dating websites worth spending time on (no phone app install required).

            I&#x27;m in Europe and 2 or so years ago I&#x27;d get a ton of bot matches on Tinder. I&#x27;ve been using it again earlier this year and the bots were gone, so it seems they are doing something about it, but it&#x27;s cat and mouse for sure. Just look at Blizzard and their botting issues in World of Warcraft. It&#x27;s not a trivial problem it seems.

            Tinder&#x27;s UX is about delivering the illusion of choice. Swiping through an endless carousel of potential companions keeps users on the app.<p>Whether they&#x27;re real or not is the user&#x27;s problem. Worst case scenario, they get fed up and go to OkCupid, which has the same parent company, and the same dehumanizing swipe based UI. Or they could go to Match.com, which I think is the parent company.

            It&#x27;s been about a decade since I last used OKCupid but I remember really enjoying it. Wacky quizzes and questions, fun usernames, long profiles, trying to find people who had both a high match percentage and enemy percentage for potentially hilarious but exhausting conversations and dates, etc.<p>Sad to hear that now it&#x27;s a Tinder clone with swiping, forced real names, short profiles for mobile, and such.

            Speaking as somebody who met his wife on OKCupid, 10+ years ago, a lot of that stuff has now gone away.<p>You can write a long profile, but in order to message somebody you have to match tinder-style.  The quizzes are gone, the interests are gone, and the journals are gone too.<p>(There is the ability to send an &quot;intro&quot; message, which shows up to people who haven&#x27;t matched, but it is hard to discover as a recipient.)<p>Where I am there are way way way more people on Tinder as a result I think.

            Interesting how much of human mating falls under a small number of brands controlled by a single company.<p>Also funny how problematized dating outside of those approved channels has become.<p>It is, ultimately, monopoly control over human reproduction.

            I&#x27;m all for more safety and would be happy to use this if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that Tinder is a typical Silicon Valley &quot;growth and engagement&quot; operation that does not have your best interests at heart (if you find a partner, you stop &quot;engaging&quot; with the app).<p>My concern here is that this kind of verification will become mandatory and will then be used to ban people from behaving the &quot;wrong&quot; way from a company perspective - not &quot;engaging&quot; enough with it, avoiding the dark patterns, not giving it the permissions it requests, etc.

            But re-creating an account is trivial and only requires a clean device, new IP address (new SIM) and phone number.<p>Tying that to a real ID would mean you&#x27;d need a new real identity and&#x2F;or make fake documents which is illegal in most places.

            I don’t agree with this. There is only a chicken and egg issue if the people joining are the product. You can’t sell product data if it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of product to be sold. If social networks required paid membership, small amount of total users wouldn’t be a bug it’d be a feature.

            I personally don&#x27;t see a social media platform that would succeed through a mandatory paid membership. The main interest in social media to the majority of user is the reach and read a large amount of users, and keeping it small and exclusive might not be an attractive feature to a majority.

            I agree and disagree. One hand it’s free to signup and post whatever to my personal account and like a few pages. However the “reach” argument breaks down when the social media company starts filtering what a I do and don’t see. If I decide I want public reach too then I have to buy an ad space from the social media company for that reach. So if that’s true then the reach you get is a lie and you have to pay for membership anyways.

            After tinder came out my best friend was the first person I knew to have the app. He excitedly told me he was chatting to someone attractive and showed me the messages. Though they seemed to have already had a whole conversation it gave me a strange feeling. I told him I thought it wasn&#x27;t a real person but wasn’t sure. So we sent the exact same messages that he had sent before and after getting exactly the same response we knew it was a robot. I think about this from time to time as this AI basically passed the Turing test and seemed to be on tinder with no goal to scam, and as dating apps were so new and rare that scams had not yet been formulated. The bots that followed in subsequent years were never anywhere near as polished or convincing.

            humans must perform the “sex” ritual as a sacrifice to the stork gods, it seems. i’ve yet to determine why they often try to summon the spirit of their fathers repeatedly through incantation, though

            hm, a fair and puzzling question. if you practice this strange magic alone, perhaps try shouting for your father’s spirit to descend upon you, loudly and repeatedly, and then report back your experience so i may add it to my research. (note: it might be best to open your door&#x2F;window while you do this. being in the presence of others seems to make the ritual more successful)

And in a way that’s neat, they are nice people and I want to go there some day. But I really wish I’d be shown to more people near me so I can actually meet someone IRL and have it turn into something meaningful. I cannot afford to travel right now and even if I could, COVID-19 is still making it difficult.<p>All I want is to meet some women, hang out with them and find someone that we both enjoy being around each other.<p>I’ve had very few matches with people actually from my country in the past year and in every year prior.<p>I’ve been to a grand total of one date in the past year. And I’ve had proper text conversations with maybe a handful of people from my country at most.<p>Maybe it’s a sign that I should earn some
money that would allow me to leave this country for somewhere else, idk.<p>One thing is for sure, Tinder is just not my arena in this country. So I’ve uninstalled it for like the 20th time. We’ll see how long it goes before I install it again, so I can continue meaninglessly swiping on people from my country that are not going to even see my profile, just like it always is save for a few people a year.

            I prefer OkCupid, because people have space to write a lot more, and you get a better idea of personality.  On Tinder it is all about the photos, and little about the personality until you&#x27;ve matched.<p>But it has to be said I&#x27;ve had far more meetups with tinder than anything else.  Here in Helsinki it seems to be pretty popular.  Maybe I stand out because I&#x27;m a foreigner, wearing a kilt, but I guess I&#x27;ve been quite lucky in that I get matches pretty frequently.<p>(Though I go through phases where I ignore it for a few months, then use it for a few hours every day in a week.)

            It doesn&#x27;t work that way, it just makes you come up in the &quot;target&quot; destination&#x27;s searches but it still will say &quot;678 km away&quot; etc. So it&#x27;s explicit and obvious to all who sees your profile.<p>It&#x27;s a good feature, you can match with people a few weeks before going to another destination or on holiday etc.

            It wholly mass-commoditizes something that has never been mass-commoditized (and should never be) before. When this happens, you&#x27;re often left with the raw economics of the situation. And this is what&#x27;s happened with dating. And hoo boy, do people not like talking about it either. It displays a lot of uncomfortable truths about men and women&#x27;s places in societies. If anything it should be discussed more, but emotions often get in the way.

            Never heard him bring up incarceration rates (link? perhaps  content I&#x27;ve never seen), he tends to highlight the stats around children-out-of-wedlock, ratio of unmarried to married Black women, and amount of unmarried, childless middle-class Black men.

            I don&#x27;t know the exact one to be honest - it&#x27;s one of the 15+ minute ones where he has a caller and he takes apart why their expectations are over the top and they should reconsider. He lists statistics like, so-and-so % of black men earn less than $X, so-and-so % of black men are imprisoned, and so on. Probably one of the ones that expects a $500k&#x2F;yr guy.<p>For anyone who hasn&#x27;t watched his YT vids, take 30 min and go through some of his shorter clips. It&#x27;s quite interesting what the expectations out there are.

            I haven&#x27;t seen KS talk much about incarceration rates, but that&#x27;s because his focus is on bw, and bm who are successful businessmen.<p>What KS brings up specifically about the black community is that bw don&#x27;t respect (ie. despise) bm, which doesn&#x27;t happen in other groups, and is really the focus of his show. (His bw guests invariably admit that at the end of the discussion.)

            In real life I think it’s easier to get a feel for people outside what they’re advertising and also it’s not a swipe-right&#x2F;swipe-left scenario where if you don’t like the immediate presentation of a person you never have to interact with them again. Then ofc there’s the old cliches about all the information lost in purely online communication versus in-person.<p>Dating apps just feel like I’m looking at the same few people over and over again with the outliers being seen mostly as negative. Nobody looks particularly interesting or like someone I’d get along with, whereas in real life interactions I don’t find myself filtering people this harshly. This is an issue I’ve heard of from people of all genders&#x2F;sexuality’s. It just feels like a worse version of job hunting. In fact this analogy seems almost too perfect.<p>You “apply” on an online platform with a low response rate, with a number of the “applicants” effectively treating it as a numbers game just to get something. Many of the responses you do get are rejections. Some may end up eventually getting a positive response and either win, finding a good person for them, or end up in a less ideal situation. Meanwhile everyone tells you that this is the worst way to go about things and that the right way is to have an established network you can reach out to.

            Hey that really makes sense to me now! I think for me the curiosity aspect balanced out what you&#x27;re talking about. Instead of looking for a good match right away, I would scan for anything interesting or serious red flags and then start talking and see how it went. Of course, that wouldn&#x27;t work for everyone.<p>The job hunt comparison is perfect though, since I have exactly the feelings about job seeking online that you expressed about dating. I would have never applied to the job I&#x27;m at now, which I love, based on the job description online. It was really eye opening, a lot of the best organizations to work for are the worst at recruiting. It may be because they retain people so they don&#x27;t have to do it as often, I am three years in and still the new guy.

            how many online dates have you been on? Ive met various women and it always feels like a job. Like, we both want to date. Yet many women just wanna be friends first. Thats not the point here. If anythinf is basicalky become &quot;opposite sex meetup.&quot;<p>I have since stopped. I dont use the apps anymore. I want to meet someone naturally.

            Fundamentally, I do not think it is tenable for a mating system to offer participants unlimited choice (or the appearance of).  Also, pictures drastically reduce the number of dimensions in which you can be attracted to someone.  For example, in real life, you may become attracted to someone due to their voice, or other properties, or simply repeatedly seeing them.<p>The other problem is that it lays bare your “value” in each interaction, and it could be damaging to one’s ego.  Flirting in real life gives both parties a chance to escalate with plausible deniability.<p>The best system I have seen though is when matchmakers who roughly know both people, and can vouch for both parties’ trustworthiness do the matchmaking.  They will have the ability to objectively put two similarly “valued” people together, and possibly not only along one metric (e.g. looks).<p>Of course, this gets more and more rare as the size of one’s social networks gets smaller or has fewer overlaps.

            It feels like people try aim very high in the candidates they pursue, and in the process, they end up missing the window for when their value is at its peak, and hence have to sell themselves for less than what they could have gotten earlier.  Or end up simply choosing not to sell at all.

            From my perspective, not OP&#x27;s:<p>At one point I read somewhere in some pop-psych book that people naturally tend towards symmetric engagements. I think this particular remark was speaking on the point of physical attraction. And from a logical standpoint this makes sense at a baseline (wherein all other things are equal). But say, your photo shows a 3&#x2F;10 on the highly arbitrary meter of attraction. You&#x27;re presented with a battery of perceived-people [1], these are accounts, with photos of humans who one trusts has another human at the other end that is accurately represented by the profile details. You&#x27;re not immediately confronted with the fact that some people are literally only engaging in the system to accumulate matches, bots, advertisers, scammers; one naturally places their trust in the system. This trust allows the user to reasonably assume any matches made are reflective of their value. In reality about 2&#x2F;3rds (anecdotal) are indiscriminate. This feedback can duly be intuited to move the personal perception of self-assessed attraction from a 3 to say a 5 or greater, and generate unrealistic expectations in the domain of physical attraction. What&#x27;s more is, I&#x27;d conjecture that the external valuations are more impactful than self-assessed attraction, that weighting strongly contributes to the big picture assessment of the mating landscape. The more feedback from indiscriminate sources the greater the pull. Physical attraction is a huge component of mate selection, so this component alone can raise an individual&#x27;s standards far beyond their standing power.<p>Then there&#x27;s the perception of the overall pool in every dimension. If one is given literally thousands of options and even the faintest glimmer of the hope ideal selection, they&#x27;re left to pick and choose in a loop that likely won&#x27;t satisfy. And if you apply the idea of hypergamy to the situation it becomes even more perverse, and this stands to destabilize what might actually become tangible by offering unrealistic prospects via the indiscriminate perceived-people. Think of the situation where a 3&#x2F;10 ends up with a 3&#x2F;10 but is more or less <i>told</i> they&#x27;re capable of netting a 5-7&#x2F;10, will they realistically settle for that? I suspect not, and this distortion makes their actual prospect pool seem far less appealing and creates a perverted and highly disposable form of relationship. And then you can lump in all of the economics, education, lifestyle, practical accessibility, plans and desires, etc... as further complicating the distortions offered up by the infinite choice fallacy.<p>[1] This should be read as: bots, advertisers, influencers, etc... <i>and facades.</i>

            Same.  I live a happy life with a very close relationship with my significant other.<p>I spent years going on dates and refining a charming persona, but that was the means to the end.  Companionship is far more fulfilling than thin ego boosts, but you&#x27;ll never find a partner unless you&#x27;re willing to put in effort to become attractive to many potential partners and then attempting relationships.  Sure, it&#x27;s a facade and not who you are in your pure, unrefined, mammalian form, but it&#x27;s a good version of yourself.<p>None of this is particularly revolutionary; it&#x27;s just how courtship and mating works with mammals.  Tinder is just the lubricant.

            What age bracket did you fall into at the time? I’ve found from talking to various people that dating apps like Tinder are great if you’re young but turn into a horror show after about 35.<p>I think there’s a winnowing effect as you age out of the app. So it may not be that they’re all bad or good but rather that you have to seek your audience elsewhere as you age out of the apps. I think this is probably true for anyone looking for a relationship.

            It definitely happens, but personally I feel like it&#x27;s so much easier to get a feel for people irl.  I still use apps like Tinder, but it&#x27;s a high noise to signal ratio for me.  A lot of times the vibe is just off when we meet up and I can&#x27;t really explain why.

            This seems like a fairly negative assessment of the facts. I think many people turn to online dating voluntarily, not as some sort of last ditch effort to find a partner. Au contraire, the people I found in the typical settings where you meet new people like bars, night clubs, and doing my hobbies, tended to be a very particular kind of person. I would never have found my current partner in any of those places, and I know the same to be true for many of my friends.<p>Online dating is just increasing your dating surface area by 10-100x fold.

            I guess I have a very different experience. I consistently found that online dating (especially Tinder) felt, for lack of a better word, fake, and weirdly like job hunting only worse. The only reason I ever bothered was because nobody seems to do the kinds of things where people used to meet their significant others anymore. People can&#x27;t even be assed to make plans these days for fuck sake. Personally, I find the whole thing so tedious and terrible that it isn&#x27;t even worth it.

            And in my experience I&#x27;ve met my current and loving partner on an app, as have many of my friends. The fact that the majority of couples now meet online (it&#x27;s actually higher than my graph says, as it counts people who link on an app and then meet at a bar as part of the bar and restaurant category) must mean something is working, for large groups of people.

            I mean, I guess? I find it nice having a dedicated channel knowing the person on the other side is single and actively looking for some sort of connection. Treating it as a spontaneous connection the same way you would meeting someone at a coffee shop to get to the first date stage seems to work fine.

            I&#x27;ve since realized I&#x27;m just not destined for a relationship since I&#x27;m way to self motivated and willing to change. I&#x27;m not ugly either. I just can&#x27;t stand how most women in my area are either boring socialites that have no skills, overweight, or are just a shackle. I haven&#x27;t given up, I just found myself alone and I&#x27;m happy with it. I figured being with someone might make it feel different but it definitely does not.

            This is because the poster is interested in women. Tinder does not expose you to your own peer group, so you do not have a chance to see the patterns that people fall into.

            It&#x27;s what Tinder has become, predominantly. Young attractive women get more than enough attention from social media, they&#x27;re not even on dating apps as they were a decade ago. I try it once in a while just to see. But the audience is abysmal. Actually easier to go out and meet someone. Which is wonderful, but there was a bright, shining time when you could just chat and meet up on Tinder or OK Cupid.

            &gt; Young attractive women get more than enough attention from social media, they&#x27;re not even on dating apps as they were a decade ago.<p>I think this is a very strange take. Attractive people of any sex or gender get attention in many places. However, attention ismt dating - dating mostly happens in places people go to for dating. That may be bars, college parties, it may be Tinder&#x2F;Grindr&#x2F;OKCupid, it may be Instagram&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;TikTok&#x2F;Snapchat. Sure, some people serendipitously meet their SO in other circumstances, through common friends etc. But by and large, if you want a date, you simply need to be in the one of the places where your peer group dates, online or off. If the new dating app is Instagram, so be it.

            Attractive women get a lot more attention than attractive men. I think that&#x27;s common knowledge and is the manifestation of our biology: Men&#x27;s drive to &quot;chase&quot; women is higher. Testosterone is a hell of a drug.<p>Also, from a reproductive standpoint, women are more valuable. Men&#x27;s sperm is plentiful. Women&#x27;s egg and 9 months commitment is the bottleneck. So of course some interesting power dynamics come with that.

            Perhaps, but it&#x27;s irrelevant here. The fact is people who are looking for dates congregate in different places at different times. If Tinder is no longer the place to be, something else has taken its place.

            Getting a request for a provocative picture of eating a corndog was definitely the most funny to me. The Chris Hanson moment was usually when the victim suggested a real date or offered to send a pic of his willy. I&#x27;m not THAT committed to humor.
