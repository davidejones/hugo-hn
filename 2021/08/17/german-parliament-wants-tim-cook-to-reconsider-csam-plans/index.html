            An article by an apple hype website is somewhat dismissive of everyone’s apple concerns. You don’t exactly hire people for that job who aren’t big fans. It would be nice to find another source with the actual text of the letter but I wasn’t able to find one

            We sadly have tons of such articles, but I would forgive &quot;appleinsider.com&quot; here. You can deduce what to expect.<p>That said, there are election in a few weeks... I think they are mostly lying and there are ambitions from all parties to increase control of online content caused by intangible fears. Parts of EU policy also is in direct contrast to this.

            you don&#x27;t even need to go to the Stasi. In West Germany there also always was a recognition of the right to private communication which is why the so called <i>Briefgeheimnis</i> (&#x27;secrecy of letters&#x27;[1]) was enshrined in the basic law. Privacy of correspondence is very, very hard to circumvent for historical reasons but also because it just seems essential to me in a free society to not treat everyone as a potential criminal who is subject to mass surveillance.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secrecy_of_correspondence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secrecy_of_correspondence</a>

            Put it this way – when newspapers wanted to know if Biden had spoken to world leaders about the Taliban, they asked the NSA.<p>I think it’s safe to assume at this point that many politicians in the US are compromised by domestic intelligence agencies.

            It’s the German parliament, not government (although I guess there are definitions that include all three branches, the latter seems to be used synonymously with ‘administration’ here).<p>The committee chair in question is from the liberal (as in libertarian, for Americans) party, which isn’t part of the governing coalition.<p>That being said, the criticism isn’t necessarily outside the mainstream, and both his Free Democrats and, even more so, the Green Party that would likely agree could well be part of the next government six weeks from now.

This legislation might then also affect securely end-to-end encrypted communications.

            I don&#x27;t think this is flamebait&#x2F;unsubstantive.<p>A decent part of German population has first-hand experience with living in an overt mass surveillance state that people in the US do not have.<p>As such, we can expect Germans to be more aware of surveillance issues, simply because many have seen where that road leads (while we in the US have not).<p>The parent message is akin to saying that one should take advice on workplace safety from a person injured at work seriously due to them having first-hand experience of the consequence.

            I realize that dang&#x27;s role is literally THE moderator of HN (for which I am greatful) but I agree with my siblings: this is actually topical and on point. I lived through the fall of the Berlin wall, from afar, and my ancestors were persecuted and killed in WW2, and I lived in fear of my own heritage. So I think this is a reasonable comment.

            Attempting a summary from years of following the moderator comments: it&#x27;s not just the substance, but how the substance is conveyed. You can write a comment making the connection between the German experience and what&#x27;s going on now --- a sibling comment sort of did --- but you have to do it carefully. Otherwise, you&#x27;re pattern-matched in with the other sorts of one-line comments that invoke the Stasi, and the important thing moderation is trying to do is to modulate the impact comments have on the conversation, so that pattern-matching matters.

            Are you unaware of both the Stasi, and the fact that within the last 100 years, Germany experienced the rise of not one, but two extremely hostile and repressive government&#x27;s hell bent on either exterminating every last undesirable, or rooting out any possible resistance&#x2F;capitalist spy? Do you have no imagination to fill in the blanks of how much worse something like that could be with the assistance of pervasive client side surveillance capability should that ever recur? Have you forgotten that in addition to many other noteworthy controbutions, IBM also was more than happy to help organize and facilitate the systematic destruction of human life through facilitated bureaucracy? These are not even hypotheticals. These are history. Germany stands as one of the only Western civilizations to have recently experienced inflicting and receiving both of those circumstances. With the poignant reminder to all of us that the plight of those in Afghanistan are in the midst of learning, every damn one of us should be giving a cold hard look at the ugly applications of what we do and asking if we are not possibly creating something that we know will be abused. Companies follow the money. Politics change, capabilities, however, do not. Once the system is there, it will be used, and no company, a construct tolerated and given positive manifestation by State fiat will not stand long before that same authority when push really comes to shove consider the longest established U.S. company is a blip in the pages of history.<p>&gt;And that&#x27;s not even mentioning the veering into classic flamebait territory.)<p>We&#x27;re not context blind rules engines. There is good signal here if you are willing to listen to it. Yes. It&#x27;s hard. Usually, you hear this, and it all goes the same place, but we&#x27;ve (in the royal sense) lost something important in the last couple years; the ability to back away from something and to just let it sink in without taking a stake in whose saying it or where it fits in the Internet zeitgeist.<p>I know your mod senses are tingling, and I understand totally why. I didn&#x27;t post it at first, because I figured you&#x27;d shortly follow up with this exact post. However... Well, I felt and thought it too.<p>Keep an eye on it by all means, and if it devolves into bedlam do as you must, as you always do. I just see signal in the poster&#x27;s sentiment, as genuinely terrifying as that prospect is.

            Of course I&#x27;m aware of that; the point is that reflexively bringing it up because the word &quot;German&quot; appeared in a title related to privacy themes is an obvious cliché and therefore an unsubstantive comment.

            As much as I oppose this, calling this the “biggest breach of the dam for the confidentiality of communication that we have seen since the invention of the Internet” is a joke. 
I can see how apple ‘thinks’ everyone is misunderstanding it. Other service providers have implemented these measures (apples is the least invasive) already a long time ago, and nobody seems to care with them.
