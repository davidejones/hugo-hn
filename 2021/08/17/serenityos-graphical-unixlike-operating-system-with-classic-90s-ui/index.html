            Hello friends! I&#x27;m the original author of SerenityOS and it&#x27;s a lovely surprise to see it on the front page of HN :^)<p>This project has been quite the journey for me, from starting it from scratch ~3 years ago, to quitting my job ~3 months ago to focus on this full time. [1] It&#x27;s also grown from a 1-man project into a bustling open source community with 475 contributors and counting.<p>If anyone has questions about the system I&#x27;m happy to answer them! I also have a huge library of content on my YouTube channel [2], where I&#x27;ve uploaded hundreds of videos of me working on the system in real time, and also monthly update videos (since April 2019) where I demo recent developments.<p>Our main community hub is over on Discord for anyone interested in joining development.

            Hello, thanks for helping make SerenityOS, it looks very interesting! I&#x27;m afraid i don&#x27;t have the skills&#x2F;time to contribute to development, but i&#x27;m interested to follow discussions. Is there a way to join your room from a free&#x2F;libre decentralized client like IRC&#x2F;XMPP?<p>A bridging bot like matterbridge is fairly easy to setup these days, and i&#x27;m happy to provide free hosting for it (on a small volunteer-run infra) if for some reason you wouldn&#x27;t know where to host it. I&#x27;m always a little sad to see amazing volunteer projects organize on Facebook&#x2F;Discord ;)

            Fantastic work on SerenityOS and great videos explaining your progress. My main complaint is that you are solving many of the same problems that Haiku is also struggling with (such as slow git checkout speed) while building a &#x27;90&#x27;s era C++ based operating system. There&#x27;s a good chance that your little OS may beat ours in the end. You could have built a great C++ OS on top of Haiku instead but you went your own way with SerenityOS which is valid. You may have gotten discouraged by the sometimes thorny Haiku community development process anyway.

            Inspiring work. When you started working on Serenity it had a floating dock and macOS-like menu bars. Now it looks more like Windows 2000 in style. What made you switch to this design? Familiarity?

            I removed the global menu bar after realizing that it&#x27;s incredibly tedious to use at large resolutions. It made some sense at 640x480 and 800x600, but at 1080p and beyond, you run into a great deal of mouse travel between a window and its menu bar.

            Travel distance is not the right metric.  The question is how easy is it to acquire the desired menu as a target and select it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fitts%27s_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fitts%27s_law</a><p>Putting the menu bar at the edge of the screen effectively makes it an infinite sized target so it is much easier to target and select.  Menus at the top of a window are easily overshot and missed.  Travel distance is easily solved by appropriate acceleration in the pointer driver.

            Obviously. But I doubt app authors will bother registering menus with a global API if the global menu is not a platform standard every user expects them to follow (which is how it is in the Mac world).

            This was also illustrated by Ubuntu by the way. When Ubuntu had the global menu ootb most of the Linux GUI apps supported it. A significant portion of the same apps don&#x27;t seem to support it in other distros&#x2F;DEs even if I configure them (the DEs) to use the global menu. I tried Xubuntu, Manjaro KDE and ended up using classic in-window menu set-up because many apps used it anyway and I want the thing to be uniform (the situation when some apps use the global menu when many use their own seems ugly to me).

            Because everybody can draw their own menu in their window. Like Sublime and VSCode do.<p>Nevertheless, if you require that, why not make the place where the menu is displayed configurable? KDE does - it offers 3 options: the global Mac-style menu (which you can put anywhere, even in the middle of the screen if you want), classic Windows-style menus or &quot;hamburger&quot; menu buttons (utterly inconvenient but I&#x27;m still glad there is an option for those who like it).

            The DPI is also relevant. I find the global menu fine on my 13&quot; MacBook even though it&#x27;s 2560x1600, but it can be a bit tedious on my 28&quot; display when I have multiple applications open side-by-side.

            Exactly: if implemented right and there&#x27;s no gap between the menu and the top of the screen where the cursor does nothing, then you can just mostly jam the mouse in the general direction of the menu item.<p>Notably, Microsoft managed to bungle this initially in Windows with the task bar: there was a one-pixel gap between the buttons and the bottom of the screen, so you had to aim for the buttons or to readjust the cursor each time. (Though personally I find the downward motion more awkward anyway, both because the wrist action is weird and because the wrist and the wrist support are in the way.)

            I really prefer the ubuntu way to the Gnome one. Currently, very few actually productive apps use the gnome 3 way, and it&#x27;s not nearly as standardized across Desktops as the menu bar is. On top of that, menu bars behave the same way across all applications. You click them, and get corresponding actions and menu items you can read and skim through. The Gnome 3 way is a lot less unified, because you&#x27;ll have to decipher icons and guess at what they do ( save for the simple ones like a +).<p>This is extra frustrating to me since I absolutely love everything else about the modern Gnome UX, but the refusal to bring in a top menu bar or at least integrate it for powerful apps like gimp, vscode or blender stings and makes it so many times you have 3 top bars wasting vertical space in maximized apps when it could be two or even one.(Activities-button bar, Window title, GIMP menu bar)

            Certainly! We have a growing library of ports [1] that you can build with a single command to add 3rd party software to the system.<p>Note that unlike many other operating systems, SerenityOS aims to be completely free of 3rd party software in the default install.

            That&#x27;s cool, thanks for the links; I probably would have migrated Qt5 thought because it is much more stable and battle tested and uses C++98 which likely avoids many linker issues.

            Qt6 is built with CMake which I feel way more comfortable with compared to the configure script from Qt5 (actually, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this with just configure).<p>However, most of the code I&#x27;ve changed is used in the old buildsystem as well so somebody could possibly reuse what I&#x27;m doing in a Qt5 port. I&#x27;m not planning to do that though, Qt 6.2 will be perfectly good for my personal and selfish needs. :)

            &gt;&gt; <i>modern C++</i><p>Well, according to Stroustrup himself C++98&#x2F;03 is considered &quot;modern C++&quot; (see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stroustrup.com&#x2F;DnE2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stroustrup.com&#x2F;DnE2005.pdf</a> ); and I can confirm from personal experience that C++98 and STL were a big step compared to what we had before. C++11 and later have some advantages, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t live without (personally I don&#x27;t consider policy based design the way to go). Actually Qt itself nicely demonstrated how to do perfectly well without e.g. move semantics.

            Kind of besides the point that &quot;C++98 to avoid issues&quot; when porting to a project that requires C++20 seems a bit odd. (And let&#x27;s say that the quality of Qt&#x27;s solutions in such cases over what you can now do is ... controversial)

            That was published <i>16 years</i> ago. Fortunately, Andreas isn&#x27;t so confused.<p>C++20 is a wholly more pleasant programming environment than any previous C++. When there is a choice between the old way and the new—which there always is, for backward compatibility—the new way is almost always better.<p>For some cases, the newer way is better sometimes but not always, e.g. east function return type, with &quot;auto&quot;, vs. old-style west. For short functions, deduced return type, i.e. neither one, is often best.<p>All that said, C++20 coroutines will be much more pleasant to use when thd C++23 library support for them lands.

            It&#x27;s not that weird to be honest, if you consider a mockup applicable to 1). Mockups and rough design diagrams should be pretty much obvious and omnipresent. We often start from a visual aid and move on from that level to actual details.

            SerenityOS has implemented its own TLS 1.2 client from scratch (no server side support so far), currently with TLS_RSA_ and TLS_DHE_RSA_ only, and AES-CBC and AES-GCM only (software table driven AES, software GCM, naive CBC padding handling, nothing is constant time).<p>It does not even pretend to be secure so far (intentionally accepts self signed certs), but if they ever want to make it secure, that would be a big task.<p>For compatibility, they really should implement ECDHE with NIST P-256, because that is what most of the internet uses and what they support means they always fallback to no-PFS.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Userland&#x2F;Libraries&#x2F;LibTLS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Userland&#x2F;...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Userland&#x2F;Libraries&#x2F;LibCrypto" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Userland&#x2F;...</a>

            I somehow like this a lot.  This looks kind of what Windows NT would have been if NT 4.0 never happened, or if OS&#x2F;2 survived, or if MacOS or Windows went to a Unix kernel in the early 90s.  It&#x27;s a bit like the Nissan Figaro of desktop operating systems.  That said, going back to an alternative past can be useful beyond an art project, it could evolve into helping along the vision for better lightweight desktop operating systems of the future.  For example this might work very well as a remote desktop living on virtual infrastructure, or work well as the base for a remote desktop client.

            SerenityOS does have basic support for TTF&#x2F;OTF rendering via our native LibGfx library [1], and it&#x27;s possible to switch the system font to a vector font of your choice.<p>That said, nobody has implemented kerning or hinting yet, so vector fonts do look pretty unpolished on screen, especially at smaller sizes.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Userland&#x2F;Libraries&#x2F;LibGfx&#x2F;TrueTypeFont" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Userland&#x2F;...</a>

            I think a lot of people take throwback projects and retro computing too far by rejecting <i>everything</i> modern. What&#x27;s wrong with allowing some anachronisms for things like high DPI, internationalization, security, accessibility?

            Take a closer look - SerenityOS doesn&#x27;t reject all modern stuff. The kernel has plenty of modern security mitigations (pledge(), unveil()), and there is basic high DPI support already.
Internationalization and accessibility are very consumer product focused features, which is not what the project caters to at this time.

            Sorry about that, I phrased it really poorly. I think I was trying to convey that the project is still somewhat niche, so no one has taken up that effort yet.
But you&#x27;re absolutely right, everything should be accessible.

            Awesome! Definitely did not intend to make it sound like SerenityOS doesn&#x27;t care about modern affordances. As for internationalization&#x2F;accessibility, do you mean that these features are not supported in a &quot;we can&#x27;t display Unicode text&quot; sense or a &quot;we don&#x27;t currently have active UI translations&quot; sense?

            Andreas has recently mentioned that SerenityOS is meant to be an English-language OS. (Might have been on Discord or a Q&amp;A video, not sure.)<p>I believe his rationale is that other languages are generally awkward at talking about technical stuff, and SerenityOS is addressed at technical users anyway. In my own experience as a French native speaker, I do tend to prefer all my software to be in English rather than getting the awkwardly-translated-in-French version.<p>As far as accessibility goes, like anything in the project, it&#x27;s up to someone passionate to step up and work on it.

            It&#x27;s great to have new OSs that are actually new OSs, and that eschew the brain cancer UX that has taken over since about 2010. Since it seems to be a pet project and toy of the author and its community, I guess I can&#x27;t really <i>fault</i> it per-se, but it is really strange to me that in its love for 90s UX it failed to implement a sane form of application management. It seems to have weirdly mixed bad ideas from Windows (installers) and UNIX (fixed paths), even though multiple 90s OSs got it right (MacOS, RiscOS, NeXT, even DOS to an extent). It is also a little off-putting that it explicitly &quot;doesn&#x27;t cater to non-technical users&quot; when a pretty core part of personal computing back then was on ramping non-technical users to leveraging the power of a computer. I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong, a <i>whole f&#x27;ing lot</i> of evil has been done in the name of &quot;making computing easier for non-technical people&quot;, but Serenity takes it to the extent that it doesn&#x27;t have a live environment or installer and you have to compile it from source. I mean yeah, sure, hobby OS and all, but it just strikes me as missing a very essential component of 90s personal computing.

            First of all, not all the changes have to be implemented immediately. Andreas often livestreams hack sessions where he changes some part of the OS or the APIs, so things are very dynamic.<p>Secondly, why do you expect that this OS is ready to show to <i>any</i> non-technical user? If you did, they wouldn&#x27;t realise what they are looking at, nor why it&#x27;s a valuable contribution to the ecosystem and the fight against the &quot;modern&quot; UX trends.

            Integer scaling is in development and 2x mode is available via the display settings application. It&#x27;s not mature yet, and most assets don&#x27;t have 2x versions. But we&#x27;ll get there eventually. :^)

            The 3d styling in the UI is very nice, but the widgets are not touch friendly at all.  Even &quot;classic 90s&quot; OS&#x27;s like Windows CE used the pattern of headerbars with a few key widgets that could be easily accessed via touch, not unlike modern GTK 3.x and 4.x.  A lot friendlier than this.

            That&#x27;s correct, the SerenityOS UI does not attempt to be touch friendly. This is a classic mouse &amp; keyboard system by design. :)

            This is a really good thing. A lot of desktop stuff seems to presume a desktop has a touch interface which is almost never the case. Using the keyboard and mouse for 8 (or 12 hours in case of IE) is tiring enough. I cannot picture someone using a touchscreen for 8 (or 12 hours in case of IE).

This is a desktop computer OS, and although I can entertain the notion that someone out there might be smudging a touch screen connected to their Unix workstation, I don&#x27;t see why everyone else should accommodate this weird and ergonomically unsound input method at the expense of screen estate.<p>Also, whether they could be easily accessed really depends on the device and input method. Using Pocket PCs without a stylus was certainly no fun.

            Well, these days we have &quot;PDAs with touchscreens&quot; running &quot;Unix workstation&quot; OS&#x27;s.  Touch input is simply the native input method on these devices.

            Yes, and for most productive work this is to their detriment. Lower precision, no tactility, terrible ergonomics. I understand the need for smartphone&#x2F;tablet operating systems to design around this. I don&#x27;t understand the need for every other operating system to do so.
