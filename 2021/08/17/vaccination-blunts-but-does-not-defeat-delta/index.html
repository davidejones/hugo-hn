            I am good friends with 3 doctors, and talk to them a lot about the amazing science behind the vaccines and the incredible speed with which those were designed and developed. All agree it was done at pretty much the software speed - custom designed on the computer in weeks and then built to order - and both them and I think it&#x27;s pretty neat.<p>It is very refreshing to talk to them because they, being good doctors, deal calmly and reasonably with probabilities rather than absolutes.<p>Very early, even before general public could get vaccines, all 3 of them told me to expect something like that - the virus mutates, it is expected to develop, the mutation for reproductive number going up is likely to occur - and it did - and the vaccines will likely be needing to adjust.<p>Even the highest levels of vaccination are no protection, and I am pretty tiny Israel in a sea of the largely unvaccinated is going to be swamped.

            &gt; all 3 of them told me to expect something like that - the virus mutates ... and the vaccines will likely be needing to adjust<p>Your doctor friends were informing you about a phenomenon commonly referred to as &quot;immune escape&quot;.<p>The current mRNA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are effective at preventing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death. However, they do not necessarily prevent infection or transmission - and they induce an immune response highly targeted toward the spike protein RBD [1]. Combined with mass vaccination strategies, these factors contribute to a situation that exerts tremendous selective pressure on the virus, and can result in convergent mutations that are advantageous for the virus in a large population of people [1][2]. These mutations can lead to partial or complete immune escape, which manifests as increased transmission or virulence, reduced vaccine efficacy, and reduced immunity in naturally infected individuals.<p>&gt; Even the highest levels of vaccination are no protection<p>It&#x27;s not quite accurate to say &quot;are no protection&quot;.

            &gt;The current mRNA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are effective at preventing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death<p>According to this very article this isn&#x27;t even really true any more. Of the currently hospitalized population in Israel 60% are fully vaccinated. With 78% of the population vaccinated that implies the protection is actually surprisingly weak.<p><i>&quot; “There are so many breakthrough infections that they dominate and most of the hospitalized patients are actually vaccinated,” says Uri Shalit, a bioinformatician at the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) who has consulted on COVID-19 for the government. “One of the big stories from Israel [is]: ‘Vaccines work, but not well enough.’”</i>

            If vaccines bring hospitalizations down they are already a win. The percentage doesn&#x27;t say much about the number of hospitalizations. In a country where lots of people are vaccinated, I would expect lots of vaccinated people in the hospital too. Like others said, it also depends on the cohort (age, vulnerability, etc.).

            Wouldn&#x27;t you have to look at the age of the population that is in hospital and that populations vaccination rate to accurately gauge this?. The overall vaccination rate could be vastly lower or higher than the overall population depending on what priority groups israel had.

            That&#x27;s a misinterpretation of the statistics. The most vulnerable population has a much higher vaccination rate than the population as a whole, with well over 90% of Israelis over 70 vaccinated. People over 70 have a much higher chance of being hospitalized, so to only see 60% of hospitalizations be of vaccinated people shows how effective the vaccine still is at preventing serious disease.

            What is the age of the hospitalised, and what is the vaccination rate for that age range? I expect most of the hospitalised to be elderly, and most of the non vaccinated to be young.

            Yes the delta variant may have <i>originated</i> prior to widespread vaccination, but the <i>dominance</i> of the delta variant (and other VOCs) did coincide with mass vaccination campaigns.<p>Please see the first source I cited if you&#x27;re interested in these ideas and want to hear more straight from the experts:<p><i>&gt; &quot;The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is the molecular target for many vaccines and antibody-based prophylactics aimed at bringing COVID-19 under control.&quot; [1]</i><p><i>&gt; &quot;Such a narrow molecular focus raises the specter of viral immune evasion as a potential failure mode for these biomedical interventions. With the emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 with altered transmissibility and immune evasion potential, a critical question is this: how easily can the virus escape neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the spike RBD?&quot; [1]</i><p><i>&gt; &quot;Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to vaccines or other prophylactics that rely on one or two antibodies for protection can develop quickly -and repeatedly- under positive selection.&quot; [1]</i><p><i>&gt; &quot;The speed at which nAb resistance develops in the population increases substantially as the number of infected individuals increases, suggesting that complementary strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission that exert specific pressure on other proteins (e.g., antiviral prophylactics) or that do not exert a specific selective pressure on the virus (e.g., high-efficiency air filtration, masking, ultraviolet air purification) are key to reducing the risk of immune escape&quot; [1]</i><p><i>&gt; &quot;Strategies for viral elimination should therefore be diversified across molecular targets and therapeutic modalities&quot; [1]</i>

            To be clear, the primary suggestion put forth by my original comment is:<p><i>Strategies for viral elimination should therefore be diversified across molecular targets and therapeutic modalities</i><p>Put another way: vaccines are a powerful and useful tool that can help us mitigate the pandemic, but if used indiscriminately they may actually work against us, so we need to proceed with caution and also use other tools where possible.

            I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d adjudicate it, but I&#x27;d bet quite a lot that indiscriminate use of a (tested, safe) vaccine is pretty much always going to be better than not using it.<p>There&#x27;s of course no reason to stop at indiscriminate use of it, we should employ whatever vaccine strategy seems to be best (in an empirical sense), and supplement with other measures, I&#x27;m going at the banality of the point.

            I agree with the general point  that diversifying our vaccine targets is important for robust immunity, but you are sort of coming close to advocating that we not use the particular somewhat limited vaccine tech we have at our disposal now.<p>The best strategy against escape variants available to us right now is to reduce transmission rates (especially to immunocompromised people) as much as possible with high vaccination rates.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;laninf&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS1473-3099(21)00202-4&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;laninf&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS1473-3...</a>

            The core point of the OP article - and the data coming out of Israel - is that mass vaccination alone is less effective than expected at preventing the surge of transmission and infection by variants of concern.<p>The article you cited is in agreement with the literature I previously cited - as more people are <i>infected</i> the virus has more opportunity to mutate.<p>&gt; The best strategy against escape variants available to us right now is to reduce transmission rates ... as much as possible with high vaccination rates<p>Your comment contradicts the mounting evidence we have available to us. Yes we need to use the vaccine tech we have at our disposal now - but in a highly targeted way, and supplemented by other viral elimination strategies that do not exert specific selective pressure on the virus.

            What keeps me worried is how much community immunity is required to stop a virus as spreadable as measles. I think it’s something like 95%. That’s a hard bar to pass for a vaccine or even “natural immunity” through letting it spread. Mixed with the possibility of long covid we could see some scary disease rates for the foreseeable future.

            So if I&#x27;m understanding you:<p>I am planning on taking my Governor&#x27;s cheekily endorsed thumbs up to get a 3rd shot. I&#x27;m going to get JJ because it&#x27;s not the same RNA spike target.<p>That&#x27;s probably better than a 3rd RNA shot (no reformulated)?

            Natural immunity gives &quot;ultrapotent&quot; antibodies that works for 23 variants, including delta. That´s what will end this pandemic.

            I don&#x27;t know if we have this, but it would be good if we had a technology that enhanced your body&#x27;s immune system to identify and kill viruses, rather than prime it to respond to a particular viral signal, that then may need to be updated as the virus changes (that&#x27;s how I understand how vaccines work, but that could be false). You might think it&#x27;s a subtle difference, but I think the former technology would be leaning into the body&#x27;s existing ability to form a variety of antigens for viruses it encounters, and boosting its defense&#x2F;offense against those, rather than &#x27;handing out a series of police composite sketches&#x27;, and saying &#x27;Be On the Look Out for this specific guy, he might be coming through here.&#x27; The former could be more alike to enhancing predictive policing and profiling abilities, and beefing up response and enforcement capabilities.

            The immune system already does that and its the responsibility of CD4+ helper T-cells.<p>The 2009 pandemic was significantly blunted because people born before 1957 had partial immunity from cross-reactive T-cells to H1N1 which was endemic in humans from 1918-1957.  So after mutating in probably billions of pigs for 50 years the H1N1 virus that hopped back to humans was still sufficiently recognized by the immune system of older people to take any edge off of that pandemic.<p>I&#x27;m also fairly skeptical of the data coming out of Israel about waning immunity.  Everyone is taking that data at face value while entirely ignoring the disclaimer:  &quot;(Potential confounders include the fact that the very oldest Israelis, with the weakest immune systems, were vaccinated first.)&quot;.<p>We really need a lot better data on much better matched cohorts to determine actual immune waning in the presence of the same viral variant.

            Oh yeah definitely of course the immune system that already does that, the idea is just enhance its ability so that everyone has sort of Best in class defence against these viruses.<p>it can be kind of slow on an individual level, but on a population level you will have some people who have evolved better defenses, or more resilient immune systems. If we can share that around that&#x27;s the idea.<p>It&#x27;s very interesting though about that immunity thing you say. People born then.

            Yeah, agree. It would be tricky. I&#x27;m hoping that by &#x27;enhancing&#x27; the immune system you lean into its natural self-regulation equilibrium system and avoid that mostly--but then again autoimmune disorders seemingly emerge from those stasis systems going haywire, maybe without external poking...so it would be tricky for sure.<p>I guess the intuition is that the human immune system is an incredibly sophisticated, evolving capability that over time, and over the mass population, can respond to become resilient against a wide array of pathogens.<p>So if you could somehow capture the best of that (like, for illustration, take the immune system of the healthiest, most resilient person, 30 generations from now in the future) and convey that benefit to many other people, that would be truly awesome.<p>Sort of like an idea of training an AI, more iterations are better, the immune system of any one person at any one point in time, might not be so great, but the best immune system of the population after encountering many pathogens, is going to be really great.<p>How can we short circuit that &quot;natural training&quot; process and enhance the immune system? But I agree that attempts to do so might run the risk of creating or exacerbating autoimmune diseases...But I still think it&#x27;s worth it.

            What I&#x27;m curious about is: what happens now?<p>When everyone starts realizing that vaccines and masks can&#x27;t fully contain a spread, what&#x27;s the next logical step to take?<p>Are people going to insist that you keep wearing your mask, take booster shots and live in fear for the next 50 years or are we going to collectively change our mindset from &quot;Zero COVID&quot; to accepting that COVID is just another risk factor in the world and move on?

            There&#x27;s an airbag in my car, but I also wear a seatbelt, obey the posted speed limits, use turn signals, stop at red traffic lights, and abstain from consuming alcohol while driving. This isn&#x27;t &quot;living in fear,&quot; it&#x27;s observing reasonable caution in my daily life. I don&#x27;t expect there will be &quot;Zero accidents,&quot; but I want to avoid being injured and avoid causing injury to others. And I expect I&#x27;ll keep taking these precautions for the next 50 years if I live that long. It just never ends. It&#x27;s psychologically exhausting, come to think of it.<p>But wait, now you have me thinking, what if speed limits, traffic lights and all that other stuff were optional? Shouldn&#x27;t they be? I mean, if I want to risk dying in a car accident, that&#x27;s my business, and if others are concerned about my reckless driving, isn&#x27;t that what their own seatbelts are for? I&#x27;m not forcing them to drink behind the wheel, why should they force me to not drink? Bottom line, if they want to live in endless fear of me and other freedom loving drivers, I won&#x27;t stop them, they can just stay off the roads for all I care. So why should there be any safety mandates...for anything? My state governor should follow in the footsteps of DeSantis and Abbott, and make it illegal for localities to even impose speed limits.

            The capacity limits were not an issue in the summertime when people could hang out outdoors, especially with the loosening of public drinking laws.<p>The masks? they made everything worse. They&#x27;re incredibly bothersome to wear when its hot and humid, they induce psychological pressure on you via the feeling of being &quot;smothered,&quot; and make every social interaction much harder to understand making each interaction more tiring to be a part of. It&#x27;s equivalent to being in a Zoom conversation where you can&#x27;t read all the subtleties of somebody else.<p>That&#x27;s not even mentioning the blue collar labor force which has to wear these for 40 hours a week. My friends who work as waiters, bar staff, etc. still have to wear them during the day. The last thing they want to do when they get off work is to continue wearing them.<p>(all of this is relative to NYC, which had a ~31% closure rate for small businesses)<p>I understand some people here, such as yourself, don&#x27;t think the masks are a big deal. But to the vast majority of the populace, they are a burden so bad its worth _moving cities and states to avoid_.

            It&#x27;s funny, every time this gets brought up people always say &quot;it&#x27;s not that bad&#x2F;inconvenient&quot; as if their experience is the only one that matter. If you live where it&#x27;s hot and humid climate, a cloth face covering will get extremely uncomfortable (and drenched) very quickly. Or god forbid you have glasses, long hair, and&#x2F;or ear rings that get tangled constantly. I&#x27;ve smashed a pair of sunglasses on the concrete at least twice in the last year because of masks, and very nearly my prescription glasses (which are far more expensive). Not to mention the psychological harm of (mass) mask wearing.

            Mostly feelings of isolation and depression. For some, seeing faces (in person, not over video call) is super important for socialization. Basically, if you &quot;get&quot; people watching, you probably understand what I&#x27;m talking about. There&#x27;s no studies as far as I know, but I imagine there&#x27;s certain developmental aspects of interpreting facial expressions that young children are also missing out on to some extent. For me personally, I want to leave my house much less when everyone is wearing masks, both because it presents both a physical (however slight) and psychological burden on myself (it matters more for those with ADHD and other neurological differences). The biggest problem I have with the discussion now is that it borders on religious virtue signaling with how far people take it and you cannot bring up any counterarguments or examples without immediately being demonized.

            Restaurants, bars, and shows as we know them are probably over. Wearing a mask in a bar or restaurant doesn&#x27;t make any sense. You&#x27;re going to take the mask off while you&#x27;re eating.

            There&#x27;s also people like me who have serious PTSS phenomenons with masks (for me caused by nearly suffocating several times when I was an infant). I hate it when people call it &#x27;a small ask&#x27;. Living for the rest of my life with masking is just not an option. It&#x27;s manageable during the crisis but we can&#x27;t give up on finding a real solution and keep them forever.

            &gt; And I&#x27;m vaccinated, everyone in my country who wants to be vaccinated is. Why should I reduce the quality of my life for people who made a choice and took a risk?<p>Vaccination isn’t a magic talisman against infection, or against illness if infected, or against transmitting the disease if infected. It <i>reduces the likelihood of each</i>, all other things being equal, but it isn&#x27;t a guarantee against any of them (and is less so against Delta, “Delta Plus&quot;, and apparently Lambda than other strains so far.<p>Masking further reduces both inbound and outbound transmission, and is just a basic precaution.

            Yes, mask wearing <i>when sick</i> is very common there. The vast majority of people do not (or rather, did not) wear masks during normal day-to-day life. There is a massive difference between wearing a mask all the time when in public vs wearing one when you&#x27;ve got the sniffles.

            &gt; OK, so basically humanity so far was in the wrong for not wearing masks for cold, flu,<p>Masking in flu season isn’t uncommon in some parts of the world, and it was a lot more common during the 1918-1920 pandemic, so, “humanity” as a whole is not a constant.<p>Cultural variation aside, different respiratory viruses have different combinations of infectiousness and deadliness and responses to various countermeasures, so their are rational reasons the reactions to each, given a constant utility function, would differ. The common cold, the 2019 seasonal flu, the 1919 pandemic flu, and COVID-19 are all very different things.

Taking reasonable precautions doesn&#x27;t involve living in fear.<p>&gt; or are we going to collectively change our mindset from &quot;Zero COVID&quot; to accepting that COVID is just another risk factor in the world and move on?<p>Look at the places (e.g., much of the US South) with high resistance to protective measures and the current status of the healthcare systems.

            &gt; Florida has a higher age 65+ vaccination rate than California or New York<p>No, California has 97% and Florida has 93%; California also has higher age 18-64 and 12-17 vaccination rates [0], has a number of local jurisdictions that have resumed indoor masking mandates (including many school districts for in-person education, with many of those that haven’t adopted mandates having parent-option virtual academies available) rather than a state government attempting to prohibit mask mandates. Countermeasures are more than just vaccines.<p>But, in any case, you didn’t answer the question: Are you willing to accept the degree of healthcare overload and the effects it is having on healthcare workers as a permanent or at least frequently recurrent state and accept the COVID and non-COVID deaths from exhausting ICU space, and the high burnout we’ve seen in the healthcare field? Is your plan to radically expand healthcare expenditures to expand capacity and attract&#x2F;retain people in the field with that as the normal condition?

            We had a small chance of getting rid of covid if we had gotten nearly everyone, 90%+, vaccinated. That didn&#x27;t happen, the politicization of the vaccine was insane, and so now we are stuck with covid.<p>What does this mean? It means we are all going to get covid. Repeatedly. It is a new seasonal illness that will be with us, absent some magical technology. It is (or will be) endemic.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hsph.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;what-will-it-be-like-when-covid-19-becomes-endemic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hsph.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;what-will-it-be-l...</a><p>The point of the vaccination now is the same thing as always, to minimize the impact on society. Less hospitalizations and death, less days of our life spent ill, less misery.<p>People 100% should still get vaccinated, it is deeply stupid not to. It is particularly important the next several months as delta rips through the remaining unvaccinated population (which include those that can&#x27;t, including under 12 year olds), because we want to avoid filling up hospitals and making our health care quit. For the same reason, we should wear masks and maybe try to reduce the time spent breathing each others air a bit. But the only ones that should live in fear are those unvaccinated that have never had covid and probably the old. But managing fear is something the old has to do anyway, comes with age ;)

            We had a non-zero chance of stopping covid, even considering vaccines would take a couple of years to get to everyone, it didn&#x27;t matter (much) if variants happened. The chance of zero covid comes from vaccines coming out fast enough to drop the R value below 1.0 for a significant amount of time for the virus to go away.<p>However, in hindsight, with animal populations being able to get infected, I think it probably was zero, although that gets well beyond my armchair &quot;skills&quot; ;)

            My point is that it is here to stay, we need to mitigate the rest of the initial infections (hopefully delta will take care of that in the next month or so), and then we go back to living our lives where individuals choose their own approach to avoiding and handling infectious pathogens.<p>To be clear: that means no mandates.

            Hospitals are collapsing again, we can&#x27;t ignore it.<p>Get people vaccinated.<p>Or else we&#x27;re going to wind up &quot;flattening the curve&quot; again until we finally burn through enough dead people that everyone is effectively either recovered or immunized and then the endemic burden should be an order of magnitude lower.<p>And hospitals only have so much throughput going through the ICU and into the morgue that they can sustain, which is limited by burned-out human resources, that have been strained and quitting during the pandemic.<p>If you want to totally let it rip and destroy the ICUs then you better drive really fucking carefully for a few months and hope you don&#x27;t get a poor diagnosis of something or other fairly nasty.

            &gt; Get people vaccinated<p>Repeating this line doesn&#x27;t really work anymore. I vaccinated myself and my whole family months ago, my county has ~80% full vaccination rate, anyone and everyone who could and wanted to, got a shot already.<p>Yet, there are 90 million people in this country that don&#x27;t give a shit and will not vaccinate. Worse, soon the vaccine will probably wear out, and then the whole country will have to be convinced all over again to get a booster shot, who knows how many times, too. And then there is stuff like TFA that says that although vaccines are the best we&#x27;ve got so far, vaccinated people still end up in the hospital.<p>So although I&#x27;ll personally line up for any booster shots the moment they become available, the reality is probably going to get much more complicated than vaccinating everyone and moving on.

            I feel at this point hospitals should just triage the willfully unvaccinated covid patients behind all other emergencies.<p>Possibly set aside X number of beds for covid patients, the rest of the ICU beds are for everything else.

            I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that simple. Could we also triage patients that have an unhealthy lifestyle as recommended against by doctors for a long time? We know eating well works to build and maintain a healthy immune system, and that heart disease and obesity is one major factor to covid hospitalization and death. Could we put put the ones that have decided to stuff their faces with fast and processed foods in the back of the line with all other emergencies?

            Sure, if that becomes necessary due to America&#x27;s lifestyle, I don&#x27;t see why not.<p>I&#x27;m unaware of that being the current issue though. It seems to me hospitals are overrun with COVID patients, most of them their due to their own unwillingness to get vaccinated.

            I used to joke that I gotten so many tetanus shots that I can cure it by laying on of hands. But consider women, they have all sort of intrusive health related stuff imposed on them. They get pap smears, mammograms, then consider all the things that happen with pregnancy.

            The article mentions vaccination, but it also mentions that Israel is going to have to go back to masks and social distancing. It is my understanding that this situation happened partially because they stopped wearing masks...
There was a prior study that mentioned the efficiency of the vaccine alone was somewhere in the 60-65 percent range without masks for the BioNTech vaccine, about a 33% drop in efficiency is nothing to laugh at.

            The shot still generally does a great job at keeping the vaccinated from hospitalized.<p>We&#x27;re already burning out our primary care enough for some to leave the profession, or worse.<p>Just because COVID is another risk factor, it doesn&#x27;t mean we stop taking measures against it. The flu&#x27;s a risk factor, yet we take flu shots, and don&#x27;t go out french kissing strangers who&#x27;s coughing, sneezing and having a fever.

            If our mindset had been &quot;zero covid&quot;, we&#x27;d not have gotten the mutants and the v1 vaccine would have driven it extinct.<p>Please dont abuse the name of a strategy that was never implemented.<p>What governments did was &#x27;keep incidence below X by means of lockdowns&#x27;, and &#x27;relax restrictions if incidence is below X&#x27;.<p>This is a simple control system that keeps the incidence at X. Not below X.<p>Unfortunately X was chosen via hospital bed capacity, so it was quite high, about 500 cases &#x2F; 100k per week. High enough to generate mutants. With X=5, the same lockdown measures would have been in effect for much the same time (they&#x27;d have been started a few weeks earlier). Also, for very low values of X, you might have been able to get away with just contact tracing or travel controls instead of lockdowns, so the average lockdown intensity over time, under zero covid, could have been lower than what we had. The point of zero covid is to have less lockdown!<p>Anyway, the idea was to buy time until you get the vaccine. Zero covid was never intended to be an indefinite duration program.<p>This is what zero covid really means (low X). I agree with everything else you said.

            If we had effective treatments and OTC therapies for this illness, the pressure to vaccinate against every resurgence and new mutation would basically disappear. With so much social difficulty with vaccines, this seems like the most likely long term path. Where&#x27;s my cherry flavored Covidquil?

            This doesn’t seem like a particularly likely path, given the… lacklustre performance of most antivirals. Like, no responsible doctor would ever say to an at-risk person “no need to get the flu vaccine; tamiflu exists”. Even if an effective antiviral shows up, realistically it’ll probably be more a tamiflu than a magic cure.

            This is absolutely wrong.<p>A vaccine is a fraction of the cost of treatment, and it has no long-term side effects. Even better, a vaccine reduces the chance for a virus to mutate.<p>Treatments, even if they work, are going to have side effects, and there are still unknown risks from a severe (unvaccinated) infection anyway.<p>Vaccines are a miracle of proactivity, and there&#x27;s no reason to try to replace them with something expensive, risky, and reactive.

            Honest question here, do vaccines actually reduce the chance for covid to mutate? Spitballing, I would expect a vaccine to decrease the number of total mutations that can occur but also simultaneously increase the selective pressure on the virus, increasing the chance that any  mutations that improve the virus’ ability to resist the vaccine become dominant.<p>To make an analogy, does spraying every surface in a hospital with an antibacterial solution result in no bacteria or just make it more likely to see resistant bacteria? I’d guess it’s a function of how potent the solution was and how well every last surface was coated. If you start with a 10% solution, don’t achieve full coverage and keep ramping up slowly perhaps we’ll just see something like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=plVk4NVIUh8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=plVk4NVIUh8</a><p>Agree with the rest of your post though.

            i don&#x27;t know a lot of doctor that advocate for the benefit of a covid vaccine for young kids. when they do it&#x27;s usually in the hope of herd immunity, which seems disproved by the variants cases in countries with hugh vaccination rate.<p>in general i would also be very skeptical of &quot;scientific consensus&quot; related by the media when you see how much bad press some doctor got for criticising public health politics (even when proved right later on).

            We know that the spike protein itself causes damage. For adults that’s almost never an issue, but I feel like the overarching recommendation that pregnant women get the vaccine is misguided. It doesn’t make much sense to get it if they’ve already had COVID or are still working from home.<p>If those aren’t true then the risk is probably worth it as a raging infection would almost certainly be worse for the baby. I just wish there was some nuance in our government’s recommendations.

            Hey man, right here with you feeling rough after jab #2 :) The roughness is your immune system, not the spike protein itself per se, which is why jab #2 makes you feel a lot rougher - your immune system goes ape the second time.<p>A little perspective - one way or another, we&#x27;re all going to be exposed to this damn spike protein eventually, and the vaccine is <i>by far</i> the safer way. If it does do something bad, we haven&#x27;t noticed it yet, which presumably means it can&#x27;t be <i>that</i> bad. I haven&#x27;t seen any reports of people getting long covid from a jab.

            In addition to the links dTal commented with, your own link says this:<p>&quot;While it is true that the spike protein has &#x27;superantigen&#x27; properties, which means it has the POTENTIAL to cause adverse effects, we know that it doesn’t cause these effects in many infected patients, it doesn’t cause many of these superantigen effects in most vaccinated individuals, and the levels are incredibly low in the blood, suggesting this shouldn’t be a concern,&quot; he said.&quot;<p>Many, most, etc. is a pretty far cry from &quot;absolutely does not.&quot;  I already said for most people it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  Could it be developmentally harming fetuses?  Maybe we&#x27;ll find out 10 years from now that they&#x27;ll have a slightly lower IQ than they should.<p>Or maybe for adults we&#x27;ll see an increase in autoimmune diseases a few years from now.  Or, hopefully, there will be no widespread long term effects.  These things take time to suss out.  I&#x27;m so incredibly sick of absolutism reigning over everything now.  It should be perfectly acceptable to have a nuanced opinion over who should take the vaccine instead of <i>everyone</i> or <i>noone.</i>

            Goodness. Vaccine rates in the U.S. are stalling at 60%. Now the plan is to do booster shots after 8 months. What do you think is going to happen to those rates with the first booster? The second?<p>Vaccines are great. Therapies are also great. This is absolutely not wrong.

            There were several prominent epidemiologists who said early on “Covid will end up like the flu, you’ll need a yearly vaccine, we’ll have new variants and we’ll get waves of infections through out the year”.<p>And here we are.

            With that high number of young people dying of the flu back then you may say that the host mutated and became less susceptible to the original strain of the flu.<p>Since SARS-CoV-2 seems to be especially dangerous for people after reproductive age I don‘t expect the same pressure as with flu. It may influence our inverted age pyramid, though. And it may have influence on the number of highly educated people &gt;50 and older people with disposable income.

            I havent (needed) a flu shot in a couple decades. 
I&#x27;m not interested in yearly jabs. Better to lose the waist inches and high BMI. Few want the self-responsibility of healthy living.<p>And I don&#x27;t agree with headline of &quot;grim&quot;, as it was obvious a year ago this was coming. Who lost any excess weight in the past year?

            I live healthy. I built a home gym at the start of lockdown and have continued to train powerlifting and Olympic WL both throughout. I get my cardio in, I eat well. I didn&#x27;t lose weight in the past year – I gained muscle, and my numbers are the best they&#x27;ve ever been.<p>I got both Pfizer&#x2F;BNT shots as soon as I could, and I&#x27;ll get the boosters as soon as I can too.<p>The belief that healthy living alone is enough to stymie a virus that we still understand relatively poorly is foolhardy.

The biggest risk I would have faced was myocarditis, and the risk even for that is higher from a COVID infection than from the mRNA vaccines.<p>Furthermore, getting vaccinated means that we all get back to a place where COVID is less of a big deal societally. While the data does show that vaccinated individuals can transmit Delta, it shows that they do so for a shorter period of time, and anything we can shave off of R0 is a good thing. Perfect, enemy of good, etc.<p>Getting vaccinated was close to no skin off my back. I had a sore arm for a few days. The payoff is that I reduce the (admittedly small) risk I did have, and I&#x27;m part of the herd boxing COVID in.<p>What&#x27;s the downside?

You&#x27;ve just taken an experimental drug which has yet to be approved by the FDA, and was designed using novel technology we haven&#x27;t broadly tested on humans.

            Covid19 already has well-known short- and mid-term downsides for &gt;&gt; 1% of grown-ups infected. The hard “downsides“ are so dangerous that we had trouble to properly treat the sick.<p>BNT&#x2F;Pfizer has so little short- and mid-term downsides that it is difficult to properly spot them statistically, even after about a half billion vaccinations.<p>Both may have long-term downsides, but: all vaccinations we know didn‘t have any long term downsides. The problems were either visible immediately or they were relatively rare so that they were only detected after a significant number of people had been vaccinated. The downsides of Covid-19 are not rare compared to that, for any age.  
There is no reason to consider the vaccine more frightening than Covid19. 
On the other hand <i>everything</i> about the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease Covid-19 is experimental because this virus has not been tried on humans until now!
The infection it causes is way more complex than the immune reaction BNT&#x2F;Pfizer causes and it definitely would not have passed a phase-1 study.<p>If you are afraid of BNT you should basically panic about Covid-19.

            &gt; Reminder of the Thalidomide drug<p>Bringing up Thalidomide &#x2F; Contergan in a discussion on current medicine is the best indication that you don‘t have the least idea on the topic.
All rules and tests that eg the Biontech-Vaccine had to pass (and has passed) have been installed _after_ and _because_ of the Thalidomide catastrophy.
Bringing up the topic of Thalidomide exactly disproves any point you are thinking you make, because the level of safety in medicine we have today has been raised to a level incomparable to what we had with Thalidomide.<p>What you are saying instead is: “Current medicine must be _very_ safe because todays‘ safety protocols are so much higher than what we had back then.“

            Not sure why you&#x27;re getting downvoted. Comorbidity is a fundamental driving factor in whether or not you survive this virus. We&#x27;ve not heard any recommendations from any health agency suggesting a healthier lifestyle would help - it most certainly would statistically speaking. And 18 months in I doubt we&#x27;ll see anything like that because it has proven to not be politically expedient. (FWIW Ive been intermittent fasting with some pretty good success)

            The goal was to get as many people vaccinated first before being naturally exposed to the virus.<p>That should cut down the fatality rate, along with the rest of the lifelong damage the virus causes, by at least an order of magnitude.<p>The goal was also to avoid the hospital system and ICUs collapsing, which should be a natural result of everyone getting vaccinated.<p>Vaccine boosters yearly or every other year were also always discussed as early as March 2020 to deal either with waning immunity or reformulations to address antigenic escape.

            Of course it was realistic.  China basically achieved it (I am not a China fan or defender), but the rest of the world failed.  The whole world achieved it for the first SARS.  However, that ship sailed a long time ago.  Probably before the first surge in Italy of COVID-19.

            I don&#x27;t know who was saying this (I wasn&#x27;t personally reading it), but it was obviously dumb.<p>The question really isn&#x27;t whether vaccinated people get sick, or even whether they spread the virus, but whether they end up in the hospital.

At some point (at 100% vaccination rate) we&#x27;d expect 100% of people in hospital to be vaccinated.<p>Talking about &quot;breakthrough&quot; cases and how rare they are depends on the absolute number of infections. This article doesn&#x27;t have that data but it does say this:<p>&gt; Yet the country is now logging one of the world’s highest infection rates, with nearly 650 new cases daily per million people.<p>The population is 3.9m, so 2500 cases per day.

            Regardless of the rate, the absolute number is staggeringly high. As you said, Israel has 303 fully vaccinated people hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19. Adjusting for population, that&#x27;s the equivalent of the US having 10,700 fully vaccinated people hospitalized at any one point, and that&#x27;s just for critical and severe cases. If they all need ICU beds, that&#x27;s like having 10 to 20% of America&#x27;s ICU beds permanently occupied by Covid patients. It&#x27;s still much better than the case without vaccines, but if these numbers are true, there is a lot of cause for concern.

            A less effective vaccination keeps COVID around longer and farther than a more effective one, though, giving the virus more time and population surface to mutate into further variants. (But still less than no vaccination.)<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in this, so I cannot say how significant that issue is, but this is at least one potential downside that I am seeing to the vaccination being weaker for that variant.<p>EDIT: To clarify since some have misunderstood: I did not assert that the vaccination causes higher mutation, quite the opposite. I asserted that the absence of vaccination (entirely or effectively) gives more opportunity for mutation. I understand now that there are higher order effects that make this more complex.

            Is it analogous to flu? Do flu vaccines cause mutations as well?<p>One interesting thing about covid is that it seems to be the first time humanity has collected so much data (eg. contact tracing, phylogenetics through genome sequencing, etc.) about this kind of virus, and applied modern medical knowledge in trying to combat it.<p>It&#x27;s very apparent that the overall response hasn&#x27;t been nearly good enough, but it&#x27;s probably also the best response there&#x27;s ever been.

            The virus will not mutate because of the high level of vaccinations.<p>The virus will mutate because of the high level of unvaccinated people.<p>The risk is when the high level of unvaccinated are in the same population with a high level of vaccinated, of the many mutations in the unvaccinated there is a greater chance that a mutation that randomly has greater tolerance to the vaccines will be naturally selected and flourish.<p>Vaccination does not lead to more mutations, but in the absence of vaccination, resistance to vaccines does not give a mutation any advantage, so whether it flourishes or not is based entirely on other attributes.

            I haven&#x27;t been able to get a straight answer to this even from scientists on science threads...<p>Given the following:<p>1. Virus mutations do not directly react to the vaccine. These are simply random mutations.<p>2. If a mutation occurs that has a higher probability of escaping an existing vaccine, then in one unvaccinated person, that mutation has an identical chance of occurring whether that person is part of a 0% vaccinated community, a 50% vaccinated community, or a 99% vaccinated community.<p>3. Natural selection just means its ability to reproduce. Let&#x27;s say that the mutation can escape the vaccine at 100% probability.<p>Then:<p>Can that virus spread equally regardless of whether it&#x27;s a 0% vaccinated community, a 50% vaccinated community, or a 99% vaccinated community?<p>Because it sure sounds like people are saying that in that scenario, the mutation spreads <i>less</i> in a 0% community, and <i>more</i> in a 50% community.<p>Are they saying that in a &quot;mostly unvaccinated&quot; community, the <i>other</i> variants (that the vaccine protects against) that are more prevalent somehow serve to &quot;crowd out&quot; the mutation?<p>Because I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true - at least, I&#x27;ve seen reports that suggest that people can catch more than one variant at one time.

            &gt;mutations created in the unvax population benefit from resistance to vaccines.<p>I cannot see how this is correct. Because it should be the mutations created in the vaccinated that will help the virus to survive in similar vaccinated hosts..because first of all, the mutated virus need to survive in the vaccinated host, and become the dominant one in that host and thus giving it a better chance to jump to another host...<p>So this mutations must be happening in Vaccinated hosts. In unvaccinated as you said, any mutations that gives the virus immune escape capability does not give it an advantage over the other mutations in the <i>same host</i>, simply because there is no vaccine generated antibodies to kill the other mutations, for it to gain dominance.

            &gt;But still less than no vaccination..<p>Can you share why you think the current vaccines will reduce  the mutations when we already know that they only prevent symptoms (not even reduce viral load for some variants).<p>So given that, why do you think the current vaccines will reduce the chances for virus to mutate.<p>To me, it appears that the current vaccines will give the exact same chance for the virus to mutate, without the vaccine, but in addition also apply selection pressure to guide the evolution to gain immune escape.

            The likelihood of mutation is <i>directly</i> proportional to how widespread a virus is multiplied by the amount of time it stays that way (more specifically, the area under the curve for infections over time). Vaccination and control of spread is critical to preventing further variants

            Doesn&#x27;t this mostly depend on 3 things?<p>1. Likelihood of breakthrough infections.<p>2. Mutation rate.<p>3. Initial volume of infections.<p>For instance, if the likelihood of breakthrough infections is low enough to overcome the reproduction rate, the mutation rate is slow enough, and the initial volume of infections low enough, you&#x27;d expect that the virus would die out if enough people have had the vaccine, right?<p>On the other hand, if the likelihood of breakthrough infections were high, mutation rate were high, initial volume of infections high, makes sense that you would expect to see ongoing mutation.<p>Another way I think this might go is that mutations happen &amp; breakthrough infections happen, but the breakthrough infections further boost immunity, and the severity never re-approaches the original severity of covid.

            This isn&#x27;t really true. For instance, it&#x27;s been shown that mutations are far more common in immunocompromised people (many of whom cannot even take the vaccines) where the virus can just camp out for months and train itself against the human immune system. So one particular host might serve as a more fertile environment for variants than thousands of others combined.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;immunocompromised-patients-covid-variants&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;immunocompr...</a>

            Likehood of mutation might be, but spread of variants is a more complicated function. Vaccination for sure might affect how likely one variant predominates against others.<p>Considering cross-immunization between variants with natural immunity, it might be more efficient to refrain from vaccines to give cross-immunity with a weaker variant.

            Is that true? Intuitively, the more virus exists (in absolute numbers, even), the more virus may potentially mutate into worse variants. More infected people -&gt; more individual virus instances, each with a given chance to mutate, and more time for that mutation to occur (because expired virus is replenished with fresh virus in available hosts; though you can probably fold this into higher virus numbers instead with the same result).<p>I&#x27;m gladly corrected if I missed something!

            Variant that achieve immune escape from vaccine-induced immunity are bound to propagate at a faster rate if most people are vaccinated.<p>Even if that variant is more lethal (from which you might expect a smaller R0), it might be prevalent because of an augmentation in R0 from vaccination (which might be lesser had people developed a more complete natural immunity).

            &gt; Not to go full scaremonger but we don&#x27;t know that much about long covid at this point.<p>My sister had a very mild case of Covid last year after lockdowns started lifting and she went to the hairdresser (masked, obviously not vaccinated). She had the telltale loss of taste, but really no other symptom, and she recovered.<p>I saw her yesterday in person for the first time in a number of months and she looked so skinny I had to say something, it was worrying to me. She told me she has trouble eating anymore because everything tastes like shit. She says that things she used to love now taste the way cigarettes smell, and she simply can&#x27;t stomach it.<p>Her words: &quot;People need to realize that even if you don&#x27;t die from Covid, it can change your life. I wish I never got this.&quot;

            Every human that ever lives will die someday. A good life involves a prudent balancing of risks and costs. Nobody alive can ever be 100% safe before or after the advent of covid. Covid maybe a good thing if it forces mature adults to deal with their inevitable mortality like mature adults. Instead we have been seeing pervasive infantilisation of society. Safety has a cost. The world is not black and white. Disclaimer: the above is my opinion. Not flaming.

            Well let&#x27;s talk about infantilization then: I don&#x27;t mind fearing or being at peace with death. Our society could use that.<p>It&#x27;s just that we&#x27;re in a global plague right now and a large chunk of people just want to do whatever they want no matter if others are affected by their actions. Basically a stage of development such as children before they realize others are also people. It&#x27;s like ten people walking a tightrope and the last one is jumping up and down. A non-infantilized society is one where we can expect everyone to be a grownup and avoid the bad quadrant of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, and guess what? We&#x27;ve found out that you get an infantile society if people are just asked nicely

            I would respectfully submit
that the death rate of covid does not justify the scale of the response. It is unreasonable to shut down society for a disease whose median age victim is about 80 and whose whole population case fatality rate is in the low single digit percent at worse.<p>The elderly and well off want to minimize their risk at the expense of the young and the poor. Who do you think delivered your Amazon packages while you worked from home?<p>At both extremes a part of the population is unwilling to compromise and is willing to force another part to pay for their &quot;freedom.&quot; In my opinion the yuppies obessively using instacart and Amazon are just as selfish as the Trump supporters and rednecks who may have denied covid existed. Both groups want what they want the cost be damned.

            Wuhan has been reopened for a long time now. We had every piece of information to make a good decision at the time in February 2020. Now we are thrashed about in a sea of half-measures, societal tension, and the total closing up of public life. We were so lost even by the time the CDC was encouraging people to <i>not wear masks because it&#x27;ll give you higher risk of contracting covid</i>. Now our future&#x27;s truly new.

            Actually large sections of China are being locked back down again as they contend with new outbreaks. The whole concept of the Immaculate Covid Response has aged terribly as one &quot;did it right&quot; country after another either has had major outbreaks (Japan) or resorted to completely draconian and even militarized responses (Australia, NZ) to keep the spread down.

            Things have only gone this way recently because of the delta variant, if all countries had taken the virus as seriously as those countries the delta variant probably wouldn’t exist and these countries would now be able to effectively vaccinate their populations.

            Yep, new variants are always the excuse. These perfectly designed and implemented &quot;public health&quot; measures would have worked to eliminate the virus if only India had put itself into a nationwide lockdown -- it might have caused tens of thousands to starve but we&#x27;re just going to assume it somehow would have prevented the Delta variant from coming into existence!

            Smoking is a good example. My country has quite bad COVID numbers both in number of cases and deaths. Yet: in one and a half years of pandemic fewer than 4500 people died from COVID. 
About 6000 die each year from smoking-related diseases. You all probably know how different government takes on these issues are.

            I think that the reaction we&#x27;ve seen was inevitable. It&#x27;s less about covid in particular and more that (and I don&#x27;t know a diplomatic way to say it) there was a risk averse, authoritarian, nanny-state, &quot;we need to save people from themselves&quot; advocate group waiting in the wings that just needed their cue to for the balance of power to shift and their views to be prioritized.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t mean some coordinated cabal, I just mean that society&#x27;s views have drifted that way, we haven&#x27;t had anything bad happen for years, the significance of individual freedom has been forgotten, we&#x27;re well into turning on ourselves anyway. And so now with a push, there is a new majority, and we&#x27;re seeing politicians take advantage of strong views and fall in line to represent them, disregarding safeguards and norms that we previously had in place but were not updated to contemplate something like this.<p>And now viewpoints that would have been intolerant and completely out of line with western democracy, and ridiculed as some mid 20th century authoritarianism are suddenly applauded all over social media.

            There seems to be some evidence that having a longer duration between the first and second doses provides better long-term protection, i.e. gaps of 7+ weeks, compared to the 3+ weeks the US and Israel have generally done.<p>NZ is currently thinking about increasing the gap to &gt; 6 weeks because of this.<p>I wonder how much that would affect things.

            I heard that as well. My feeling is that with all the treatments we are deploying against the virus, one thing we are doing is creating a selective pressure, forcing it to evolve to promote more resistant and transmissible variants. Whether those transmissible variants also contain higher mortality might be a crapshoot game of chance, but I don&#x27;t hear this sort of idea spouted a lot and I think it&#x27;s worth considering. It might be similar to the way that antibiotics have helped select for &#x27;treatment-resistant&#x27; &#x27;superbugs&#x27;.

            Vaccines are very different from antibiotics.  Antibiotics are single molecules that bind a very specific target. A single mutation of a single protein can render an antibiotic useless. Vaccines induce the immune system to generate a repertoire of antibodies, each of which binds in a different way and each of which is then selected and &quot;evolved&quot; (hypermutation) for increased efficacy.  And each individual person creates a different starting and ending repertoire of antibodies. A single mutation, or even a large group of mutations, does not so easily side step all this diversity of antibody types&#x2F;binding modes.  Moreover, we have evidence that the idea that vaccines increase the likelihood of variants is just wrong.  We do not see that effect for mumps, polio, smallpox, or any other virus.  Moreover, delta appears to have arisen in India, which at the time had vaccination rates very close to zero.  Again, providing strong evidence that vaccines are not applying selective pressure for more virulent strains.

            That&#x27;s interesting. it&#x27;s a good argument. Maybe vaccines are the answer. But I don&#x27;t think we can rule it out and say it&#x27;s &#x27;just wrong&#x27; tho right?<p>The delta and lambda variants emerged, and they were both more transmissible, and more vaccine resistant, is that right? I mean, why do you need to evolve vaccine resistance and transmissibility at the same time? Seems weird, and given the &#x27;shotgun&#x27; quality of antibodies across individual and population, particularly so.<p>Which lets me feel that we are applying some selective pressure with vaccines. Compared to the other virus mentioned, what&#x27;s different is the scale and rate of vaccine roll out here is unprecedentedly greater. Maybe in the previous cases our immune system had already evolved stronger defenses by the time the vaccines were given, &#x27;patching more holes in the dam&#x27; so to speak.

India&#x27;s case load was also quite low at this point, and the initial lockdown was being slowly rolled back.

            Increased transmission is worse than increased fatality rate, counterintuitively, as it&#x27;s the same percentage deaths of a much much higher number infected - resulting in higher numbers of absolute deaths than if the CFR increased without an increase of transmissibility.

            The bottom line is, it&#x27;s that after second vaccination amount of antibodies start to decline and at some point of time efficiency of vaccination going down with it.
The &quot;better&quot; long term protection by longer gap between doses probably just buys extra couple of months or so of good efficiency at cost of lowered between two shots

            Isn&#x27;t that kind of true even for the earlier variants? I personally know fully vaccinated people who got infected. Their symptoms were mild, and recovery was smooth. So yes, vaccination &quot;blunted&quot; but didn&#x27;t defeat.

            I wonder what is the mutation mode of viruses regarding vaccines? Does harsher environment (more people with immunity) spur mutation, or is mutation frequency correlating with number of infected people?

            The latter. Vaccines just affect the pathway variants take, but not the rate at which they mutate (they aren&#x27;t bacteria and other life forms). And argument can be made that the vaccines create pathways to variants that wouldn&#x27;t have been as viable without the existence of the vaccine, but that&#x27;s relatively academic. A large population is what increases variant creation.

            Vaccination doesn&#x27;t &quot;defeat&quot; regular COVID as well (right?).<p>You can still get COVID when vaccinated. The symptoms you get are less intense, and therefore transmission is less likely (though definitely still possible).
