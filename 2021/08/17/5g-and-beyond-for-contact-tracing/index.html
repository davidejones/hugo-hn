            Yes. There is a demonstrable lack of need. Contact tracing has not worked and will not work for covid. As new variants emerge that spread faster, this will become even more true. The best measures against covid appear to be old fashioned common sense practices. Pay attention to yourself and if you’re sick stay home. Don’t cough, sneeze or breath on each other unnecessarily. Stand a bit further apart. Be outdoors more.

            Even if it worked, it would be trading too much.<p>We already accepted destroying conviviality, limiting freedom of movement and taking a vaccine that has been fast tracked. At this point, I think I&#x27;ve done my part in concessions, especially in regards to following the directives of people and groups that have shown not to be trusted multiple times in the past and have been spreading so many contradictory messages in the last 2 years.<p>So no, officially accepting global tracking, in addition to the secret and scandalous one, is a no-go.

            &gt; As new variants emerge that spread faster, this will become even more true.<p>I thought opposite. Contact tracing should work well for strongly spreading (without much contacting) variant because it just trace nearby user rather than &quot;contact&quot;.

            &gt; Contact tracing has not worked and will not work for covid.<p>As an Australian, I can say with certainty contract trace does work for COVID.  It is one of the tools Australia uses to keep it&#x27;s cases near 0.<p>There are caveats of course.  Contract tracing&#x27;s big brother is the lock down, where everybody is forced to isolate.  It&#x27;s the big brother because all contact tracing does is limit the lock down to those who have been exposed.  They are found by tracing the contacts of existing infections.<p>Contact tracing achilles heel it is labour intensive.  It works beautifully, right up until the number of new infections overwhelm the labour force available to do the contact tracing.  So in Australia contact trace is always paired with an initial lock down, to give the contact tracers a head start.  Delta in particular with its R0 of 7 can easily overwhelm the man power before within a week if you don&#x27;t stop it dead.  (This has now happened in our most libertarian state, forcing said libertarian state into the longest and invasive lock downs we&#x27;ve seen in Australia.)<p>In Australia contact tracing was done with no technological help whatsoever at the start.  It was all via interviews.  Now we have QR codes everywhere, which you are by law required to scan when directed to do so by the Chief Medical Officer, which is invariable while there is local transmission.  This is done as a force multiplier of course - it both raises the number of infections needed to overwhelm the system, and speeds up shutting down the outbreak.  Time is money, and in this case the money is measured literally in billions.<p>The sad and bizarre outcome is those QR codes are very invasive - we had a much better solution available.  If you visit places that must have QR codes (which broadly is any business), you by law must take a smart phone with the contact tracing app installed.  You have to enter all your details into the contact tracing app.  When you scan the QR code it uploads the exact time and place to government servers.  The uploaded information has already been leaked beyond it&#x27;s intended use.<p>In contrast the original bluetooth tracing app (and probably this 5G solution) was designed to never leak your position unless you become a close contact of a person contacted by the contact tracers.  They were far more private and resistant to abuse.  Yet Apple and Google effectively made them impossible to use, due to erstwhile &quot;privacy considerations&quot;.  And in doing so, forced the adoption of solutions where, as far as I can tell, privacy was never a design consideration.

            I would like to see more evidence contact tracing works in absence of lockdowns and other social distancing measures. Early advocates pointed to South Korea as evidence. And now:

            &gt;  &quot;It&#x27;s for yours and _everyone&#x27;s_ health&quot; is the most common premise used to reduce privacy and increase control over people.<p>I feel this one is rather new. People are by now trained to recognize the &quot;we need surveillance due to kiddy porn&quot; pattern. Many people are still unaware that the assumptions underlying most of the covid counter-measures are flawed and not supported by the data.

            There have been dozens papers like this for years spelling out exactly just what 5G is good for.<p>It should be understood that there are papers about how to do both device free localization and identification with mm wave antenna arrays. Some of these papers explicitly mention that their methods are compatible with off the shelf 5G hardware.<p>From a marketing and business perspective, what do you think &quot;edge computing&quot; is all about? What do you think &quot;internet of things&quot; is really about? &quot;Smart cities&quot;? These slogans are all but bold faced exclamations of what was intended by technologies like this.<p>Where I live, last summer during the protests, the first place 5G towers was in the areas the protests were happening, in the midst of the protests. Why? Why did protestors in Hong Kong decide to cut them down? Why are the five eyes countries so concerned about the security risks of Huawei 5G hardware?

            It&#x27;s more practical at this point to start weaning off carrying a phone at all times. Not necessarily going off grid into the woods, just not carrying it unless you&#x27;ll need it for something specific that day.

            The special thing about mm wave antenna arrays is that you don&#x27;t need to have a phone on you to be identified by the unique fingerprint of your gait. There&#x27;s enough information density in that spectrum to resolve your identity accurately even if you&#x27;re not carrying a phone. And there are papers demonstrating how to do just that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_vis=1&amp;q=mm+wave+%22device+free%22+identification&amp;btnG=" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_vis...</a>

            Just noting that some of those articles are about mm wave devices explicitly designed as radars. But if you dig through you&#x27;ll find articles geared towards &quot;mm wave antenna arrays&quot;, which is a basically a keyword for 5G radio hardware.

            Longtime HN lurker here, finally something I can chime in on, as I was involved with the development of the Covid19 tracing app for my country.<p>&gt; limited  deployment  –  any  technology  requires  a
sufficiently high number of users;<p>Sure, yes, that&#x27;s true for anything.<p>&gt; security  and  privacy  concerns  –  many  weaknesses
and privacy leakages are documented<p>I am yet to hear of any such cases, when it comes to tracing apps based on the google&#x2F;apple tracing API.<p>&gt; lack  of  reliability  –  BLE-based  apps  are  prone  to
errors due to the usage of signal-strength measure-
ments to infer contacts;<p>We did extensive testing and the only issues we found was that BLE couldn&#x27;t tell distance very accurately, but still, we could, with high enough confidence, tell that two phones were within 5m of each other or so. There was also the issue of BLE signal going through walls, which meant you might get a false positive with a neighbor, by placing your phone next to a wall, but that&#x27;s really an edge case.<p>&gt; data  governance  –  there  exists  a  double  standard
in governing users’ location data, with fine-grained
tracking of device location available only to private
companies such as Google or Apple<p>Plain false. Apps based on the API do not have users location data, only proximity data and even that is only stored on the users device and never transmitted elsewhere.
GApple covid19 tracing api is based on the DP-3T tracing protocol, the (very human readable) whitepaper of which can be read here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DP-3T&#x2F;documents&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;DP3T%20White%20Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DP-3T&#x2F;documents&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;DP3T%20White%...</a><p>There was a lot of disinformation regarding contact tracing apps, both from tin-foil hat wearers, incompetent (or maybe corrupt?) state officials as well as competing, centralized (and actually privacy-breaching) solutions. I can still see a lot of this going around.

            &gt; We argue that privacy enhancement technologies, albeit highly advisable, might not be strictly necessary, in front of the recent push of operators to enforce privacy via organizational measures.<p>The cynic in me says this is true - not because this is anywhere near sufficient to allay the concerns of privacy advocates, but because it will allay the concerns of legislators and most people who are subject to it won&#x27;t know the difference.

            Impossible and fruitless? Contact tracing has been quite effective in Taiwan unless I’ve been completely fooled by propaganda. And contact tracing apps don’t require you to accept general location tracking. They anonymously exchange temporary tokens and, when you report yourself as a positive case, the tokens you’ve used in the past two weeks get uploaded to a central authority so that anyone who has received them can see that they represent contact with an infected person.

            Testing, (manual) contact tracing and isolation is imho the biggest preventive measures that have been taken here in Norway.

            The document is from 2007. It doesn’t talk about contact tracing because phones were still using rotary dials at the time. It does mention, for example, quarantines for family members and work colleagues, which is just contact tracing by another name.<p>Contact tracing, as currently implemented in iOS and Android, does not reveal location data to third parties. There are many widespread uses of location data that are far worse for privacy.<p>For contact tracing to be useful, you need to:<p>- believe in the germ theory of disease<p>- believe in the ability to trace contacts at any level than pure randomness<p>These requirements are so low, it makes contact tracing at least theoretically useful at a level close to a tautology.<p>I find your document quite interesting in that it seems to recommend  a lot of measures that we are using now.

            At this point we can assume that anything technologically feasible for surveillance is implemented or pending implementation. There were some suggestions that the push for 5G comes from the desire to improve location tracking which is much better on 5G.

            Create a conspiracy so out-landish it out-competes the legitimate concerns for attention and burns out people’s patience for listening.

            To get the most accurate data, pervasive mmWave would be needed. Which isn&#x27;t about to be a reality anytime soon.<p>mmWave deployment proposals have hit my desk from the big US carriers. All in include fiber&#x2F;microwave backhaul throughout the campus. And that wouldn&#x27;t even provide full coverage. Pervasive mmWave coverage starts to looks similar in size to 802.11 deployments. Between that and 5G sharing unlicensed spectrum with WiFi6E, it was a hard pass for us.

            There&#x27;s a practical need for technological solution which can mitigate pandemics at scale. We went from historic cordon sanitaires that lasted multiple years to ~12 months for mrna vaccines. Effective contact tracing that enables societies to &quot;live&quot; with the virus while vaccine rollout is logical next step. Of course the chance of system being exploited in societies with the political appetite to actually enforce such a system is high. But IMO it&#x27;s better for the capability exist somewhere than nowhere, especially when risk for pandemics will only increase with population + development over time.

            It seems like places that actually did “lockdown, wear a mask, and contact trace” did better. (No place in the US did lock downs as far as I know. Several places in China did. When you’re welding steel together to enforce it, it’s probably a lock down. When you’re politely asking people to try to only go to stores once per day, it’s not a lockdown.)

            Plenty of things in the world work like that. Half assing something often has worse side effects than whole-assing it. If we had 4 weeks of strict lockdowns and then returned to normal we would have both less covid, a better economy, and better mental health.

            That&#x27;s just wishful thinking. The virus is so highly contagious that as soon as the lockdown ended, the exponential spread would start up again. So forget it, most rational people aren&#x27;t willing to tolerate more restrictions. At this point we need to focus on vaccinating as many people as possible and otherwise just accept the risk.

            Free societies do have provisions that allow for such things used with parsimony in times of great need.<p>When you&#x27;re enforcing an actual lockdown, thankfully it only takes a few weeks and people can go back to normal for the next 2-3 months. The tradeoff to liberty and freedom is more complex than it seems.<p>For example, New Zealand did it successfully, and I&#x27;d say there was a lot more freedom thanks to the times with low restrictions despite the brief but strong lockdowns.
