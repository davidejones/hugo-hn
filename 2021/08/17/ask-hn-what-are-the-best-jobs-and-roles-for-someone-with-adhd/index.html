            Whatever you&#x27;re interested in. Seriously.<p>Don&#x27;t try to pick a job based on arbitrary metrics. You need to pick something that you&#x27;ll be interested in doing, because you&#x27;re going to be doing it five days a week for a long time.<p>Start with something you&#x27;re extremely interested in, because you&#x27;re going to need that natural interest and motivation on your side.<p>FWIW: ADHD diagnoses aren&#x27;t all that rare in 2021. You&#x27;ll find people with ADHD diagnoses in literally every job out there. Don&#x27;t try to build your career or even your personality around an ADHD diagnosis. The diagnosis is just a tool for helping you navigate your mental health, not a defining feature of your personality going forward.

            What if it is computer graphics, but you heard&#x2F;read that game companies are notorious for paying very low salaries? (Living paycheck to paycheck is not fun!)
What if there are no junior positions in your area of interest?
What if the CG jobs (at film companies) who pay reasonable salaries are concentrated on a few locations globally?
What if you cannot relocate?<p>To cut a long story short: you might have to choose between the second best or &quot;less painful&quot; option sometimes. This is because of circumstances (effectively) outside your control.<p>My second-best option would be, C++ developer, but not many C++ jobs out there. (I actually really like C++.)
HFT? Well, it depends, many HFT companies use Java instead.
Embedded systems? Well, it is mostly C.
C++ jobs are out there, sure, but they are not so frequently available compared to JS or Java jobs.<p>I hate having such niche interests, but I can&#x27;t live without them. So I at least practice them in my spare time.

            Social media manager. My friend does it professionally and overall it seems perfect for someone suffering from ADHD. Why that would be I think is because it’s literally your job as a social media practitioner to be hyper active and divided in attention on no single task for very long.<p>For those saying “Do anything you love!” is not good advice in general, even if you don’t suffer from ADHD. I suffer from treatment resistant depression, meaning I’m in the same boat as most ADHD patients. My advice is to experiment both in terms of psychiatric medications first and then experiment professionally by buying some textbooks on subjects you’re curious about.<p>The hard part is always how to find the perfect book, no matter who you are. The answer can’t be found with a simple google search. Many people think they aren’t smart or don’t have the attention others do, but in reality it’s google and amazon and affiliate blog spam, whom make more money recommending crappy ones so you end up buying more. In general, you really have to judge books by the publisher and over time you learn which ones are safe bets. When it comes to book recommendations, it’s nepotism all the way down.

            Those of us with ADHD work in a non-linear way.  An example of what I mean is writing in a word-processor.  Everything is spread out in front of you and any part can be edited immediately as you follow inspiration after inspiration.  Lacking inspiration, start reading and you will be inspired.  We are good at inspirations.<p>Anything that lets you follow your inspirations is a good candidate.  Anything that lets you refresh your focus with a quick glance is a good candidate.  This includes:  any writing career, any of the graphic arts, and improv performance.  I find programming easy when I use disciplined structural programming and elaborate camel-case variable names.<p>In summary anything that provides random access to any part of a project and permits rapidly refreshing your focus with a quick glance will permit you to capitalize on the rich flow of inspiration that is your blessing.

            It might help to know what work or education experience you currently have and what your interests are.<p>Also, here&#x27;s an interesting discussion from 2019 about being a software developer with ADHD: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21716306" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21716306</a>

            The key takeaway for me from that thread was gtirloni&#x27;s comment:<p>&gt; I need very clearly defined units of work to work efficiently<p>&gt; This 1000x. I try to keep a pool of those kind of tasks when I can&#x27;t concentrate on my main task so I still feel like I&#x27;m making some progress. It&#x27;s helped a lot.

            As others have said: do what interests you.<p>This helps because interest can help you focus. Most people with an issue like ADHD have trouble getting started. If they can get started, they can perform just fine.<p>Interest helps them get over the hump of getting started.

            Non-emergency dispatcher. It can be fun, a puzzle that changes frequently.<p>Negative on both emergency dispatch and air traffic control. You need ASHD for those, where S = Surplus.<p>A lot of jobs in transportation and logistics.<p>Also, day trading.
