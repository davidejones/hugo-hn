            One important restriction on mailing is that you CANNOT mail fertile ants through USPS.  Which means that all of those ant farms you see being sold to kids?  You pay money, and get some sterile workers who are guaranteed to die pretty fast, leaving an unhappy kid.<p>If you want a real ant farm, you need to either collect ants locally, or buy ants in person from someone who did themselves.  And you&#x27;d better known the rules if you want to cross state lines with your ants.<p>(Source, I have a teenager who loooves ants and knows everything about them.  He now has multiple species of ants that he keeps.)

            I don’t know, insects have been doing pretty well for a long time, and only one large group of insects that we know of has ever gone extinct, even during the absolutely horrific Permian-Triassic extinction event.<p>I know as humans our impulse is to “do something about it”, but I think insects are gonna be fine.

            Insects may do fine, but individual species are another story.<p>For example through most of Los Angeles, if you see an ant it is probably an Argentine ant (Linepithema humile).  Over my son&#x27;s life, the variety of native ants to be found near me has visibly declined.

            Sure insects in general will be &quot;fine&quot;, but ecosystems will have to be rebuilt over time with the different dynamics.<p>Take bees&#x2F;pollinators. Another species could evolve or otherwise step in to fill the gap, but it could well result in many other plant and animal species also going extinct in the process.<p>Similar scenario with climate change. The earth will continue to exist and there will continue to be weather. But that weather could be a lot more inhospitable to our very narrow definition of habitable.

            Yes, I know global warming doesn&#x27;t mean the end of the (human) world as many suspect and are skeptical about. Humans will find a way to survive in special habitats and in much smaller numbers. What&#x27;s at stake is the current civilization. With civilization&#x27;s collapse we&#x27;re bound to repeat this progress to self-destruction cycle.

            That is really interesting! I never had an ant farm, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t given what you&#x27;ve said.<p>Are ants similar to bees in that there&#x27;s one egg-laying &quot;queen&quot; that you have to gather, or can you just gather a collection of individuals from a colony?<p>Your kid probably already knows about this, but have him check out the YouTuber AntsCanada. I&#x27;m not particularly into ants but I find his videos fascinating.

            My kid has been aware of AntsCanada for a long time, and has purchased lots of supplies from them.<p>Yes, most ants are similar to bees in that way.  In fact ants and bees are very closely related.  But a few kinds of ants (for example the invasive Argentine ants), can have multiple queens in a colony that cooperate with each other.<p>The reason for this rule is the ease with which ants become invasive species, and how much damage they can do.

            He&#x27;s at school so I can&#x27;t just ask him.<p>But if it comes to ants, I&#x27;m willing to bet money that he knows it.<p>I remember being at a bug fair with him a few years back.  There was a grad student with a display including some fossilized ants.  My son came over, looked, identified the genus, began pointing out the identifying characteristics and named multiple related current species.  The grad student&#x27;s jaw dropped open.  The only things that the grad student knew which my son didn&#x27;t was how old the fossil was and where it was found.<p>And here is some fun trivia.  If you look, between the thorax (where the legs grow) and the gaster (the bulb at the end), there is a very, very skinny petiole.  The only food that can pass through that and keep the ant alive is high energy fluid.  So a major problem for every species of ant is how to turn the world around into such a fluid so that they can eat it.

            Yep, my son did buy his first colony from a local college kid, through the GAN Project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.antscanada.com&#x2F;queen-ants-for-sale&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.antscanada.com&#x2F;queen-ants-for-sale&#x2F;</a>. Since he was away, his mom brought the colony to us, we met discreetly at a library, felt a bit like a spy transaction :-)

            Huh, this is certainly legal in Europe. You get colonies with a queen and some workers, even non-native species. Always asked myself if that wouldn&#x27;t facilitate invasions of foreign species into the eco system because ants are pretty apt at escaping.

            I love lists like this. I remember waiting for a Greyhound bus and reading the list of prohibited items and imagining the stories behind each one. It ran on for pages. Human heads were not allowed, even if frozen. Martial arts weapons like swords, nunchucks and throwing stars got a section all their own, separate from guns and knives. Each type of bodily fluid was listed separately, lest someone assume that their jar of urine didn&#x27;t count.

            There was an incident maybe 30 years ago where a medical school employee went into New York (I think it was) to pick up a batch of human heads to be used for teaching purposes. He left the box in his car while taking care of another errand, and it was stolen.<p>The box was found sitting on the sidewalk a few blocks away, with the heads still in it.<p>One can only imagine what went through the thief&#x27;s mind when he opened his &quot;prize&quot;.

Lots of stuff is just some normal person&#x27;s job to not lose track of.<p>Body parts are only super custody tracked when they are still viable lifesaving tools (ie organ transplant).

            I’ve known people with epilepsy who were banned from driving due to this possibly. If they had driven and gotten a seizure and killed someone, they would have been driving with a reckless disregard for the safety of others, which is enough of a mens rea to form intention for some level of murder conviction.<p>It is likely this is largely true, even if not formally banned from driving, so the answer is probably yes to your hypothetical they should go to prison, or pulling the normative phrase out, likely would go to prison (subject to many mitigating factors).

            &gt; They call it mental illness for a reason.<p>Even if we accept your premise that having a mental illness precludes one from taking responsibility for their actions, you still have to deal with the fact that they are a serious danger to society.

            In general we tend to over-pack and over-engineer a lot of our shipping and handling processes. Turns out many things just aren&#x27;t that big of a deal (like shipping bees).<p>My friend was stationed in Hawaii. She mailed me a coconut.

            I worked in the campus post office while in college, and one of the most memorable days during my time there was when a box of live bees was delivered. It was about the size of a small loaf of bread, wooden on four sides and covered by screens on the other two.<p>We set them aside from the other boxes, near the counter where students would come to pick up their packages. It sat there buzzing quietly all day and generating a lot of surprised looks. Pretty neat.

            When I worked in a USPS facility, it was always a mix of emotions when a box started chirping. On the one hand, cute baby birds! On the other hand, they’re going through an ordeal right now (they got special non-machine handling, but it still wasn’t pleasant for them to be packed into cartons) and their destination was most likely a factory farm.

            In case it&#x27;s helpful to know, it&#x27;s highly likely that the baby birds that you helped shipped were destined for pretty nice places!  Factory farms don&#x27;t get their birds this way, but small farms do.  Also of note, of the dozens times that we got baby birds shipped to our farm when I was a child, it was very  very rare to find more than one or two that didn&#x27;t survive the trip.  And sometimes we&#x27;d get shipments without a single loss.

            Newly hatched chickens can survive without food for more than 24 hours. They only want to sleep and can travel perfectly at this age, so is the usual way for amateurs to buy fancy chicken breeds or small chicken of known sex.<p>So, most probably those chicken would end having a happy life destroying carefully the backyard of somebody, one scratch at a time.<p>There is also a special kind of fishes that lay eggs that can travel perfectly without water in an envelope.

            <i>They only want to sleep and can travel perfectly at this age...</i><p>I&#x27;m dubious.  There is well-established research on the importance of imprinting for new-born chicks across a wide variety of bird species.  Therefore, even if the chick spends most of its time asleep, I would want to see research saying that there is no problem due to intentionally depriving the chick of an appropriate target to imprint on.

            I don&#x27;t see how anyone could possibly know what the subjective experience of being a day-old chick stuffed in a box would be like.  But I can imagine what it would be like to be a human stuffed in a box, and that doesn&#x27;t seem very pleasant.  I don&#x27;t see how the idea that it might be better for birds (who are pretty clearly sentient creatures) could be based on anything other than rationalization and wishful thinking.

            I think a more apt comparison is to imagine a human being shipped in a padded shipping container with a dozen of her friends to keep her warm and help her feel safe.<p>I&#x27;ve had chicks shipped to me this way and it didn&#x27;t appear to be traumatic at all for them.

            I grew up rural and we fairly frequently ordered chicks by mail. I told the story in college of one time, a message left on our answering machine pleading &quot;please, come get your chicks!&quot; with incessant peeping in the background, as we must have not been at home during the mail delivery. For folks who grew up in the city, even the thought of the whole thing was a very powerful (and funny) story.

            I understand that you are probably joking. For anyone less clear, <i>please</i> remember that animals have complex needs in terms of environment, food, and care to live healthy and pleasant lives. Adorable baby chicks are not a pet to be adopted lightly, without appropriate preparation. Chickens are in many ways much more demanding than a cat or dog.<p>As a chicken owner myself, I&#x27;ve heard far too many sad stories of people implulse-buying a chick at a hardware store or livestock show, only for it to perish soon after due to easily-avoided oversights or misunderstandings.

            Vaguely related and humourous:<p>&gt; Uncle Milton Industries has been selling ant farms to children since 1956. Some years ago, I remember opening one up with a friend. There were no actual ants included in the box. Instead, there was a card that you filled in with your address, and the company would mail you some ants. My friend expressed surprise that you could get ants sent to you in the mail.<p>&gt; I replied: “What’s really interesting is that these people will send a tube of live ants to anyone you tell them to.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2008&#x2F;03&#x2F;the_security_mi_1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2008&#x2F;03&#x2F;the_security_...</a>

            Which seems like a missed opportunity for a service all its own: a babysitter who babysits <i>while</i> bringing the child somewhere, rather than in a static location. Which <i>could</i> mean &quot;Uber where every driver has a babysitting certificate and the car has a bassinet and a minifridge&quot; <i>or</i> it could mean &quot;someone who&#x27;ll watch over your child on public transit.&quot; It&#x27;s fundamentally about the babysitting, not really about providing the transportation.

            The specific types of day-old poultry named in 526.31 are mailable subject to the following requirements:<p>Poultry that is not more than 24 hours old and is presented for mailing in the original, unopened hatchery box from the hatchery of origin.
The date and hour of hatching is noted on the box by a representative of the hatchery who has personal knowledge thereof. (For Collect on Delivery (COD) shipments made by a hatchery for the account of others, the name or initials and address of the hatchery or the Post Office box number and address of the hatchery must be prominently shown for this standard.)
Box is properly ventilated, of proper construction and strength to bear safe transport in the mail, and is not stacked more than 10 units high.
Day–old poultry is mailed early enough in the week to avoid receipt at the office of address (in case of missed connections) on a Sunday, a national holiday, or the afternoon before a Sunday or national holiday.
Day–old poultry can be delivered to the addressee within 72 hours of the time of hatching.
Day-old poultry sent via surface transportation, must include special handling service fees, in addition to regular postage.
Day-old poultry sent via air transportation must meet all provisions of the airlines. Delivery of the mailpiece is dependent on the availability of air carriers having available equipment to safely deliver the day–old poultry within the specified time limit.
Day–old poultry that is first shipped via a commercial air express or air cargo service and then presented for mailing to a final destination must be in good condition and properly packaged as specified in 526.32a-e.
Boxes of day–old poultry of about identical size, securely fastened together to prevent separation in transit, may be accepted for mailing as a single parcel, provided the total length and girth combined does not exceed Postal Service limits.

            I do not believe they would be mailed _to_ factory farms. My daughter raised ducks for 4H. We ordered them _from_ a factory farm and they arrived in 2 days (3 days from hatching). They had a stable high-water-content gel in the box for hydration, but it must have been an ordeal.

            I once had to go to a mail processing facility in SF to retrieve a package which had had an exception in the delivery process.  That was it&#x27;s own nightmare, but I digress...<p>The postal worker I eventually talked to had a desk in a little office where she seemed to be sorting out issues for people like me.  I think my case was a pretty mild one, but she kept getting calls from people about some live chicks which were somehow stuck there.  It did not seem like fun.<p>The post office is amazing.

            I keep insects as pets, and this seems to be a common way to get live insects from point A to point B.  I felt a little bad about having them go through the surely-unpleasant process of being in the mail for a couple days, but they came out on the other side healthy enough that I didn&#x27;t lose any.<p>Makes the idea of keeping pet insects that no store or breeder sells near you a lot more affordable, which is nice, since a lot of insects make such easy and practical pets.

            No one has mentioned butterflies yet. Not an advertisement: we ordered butterfly caterpillars from insectlore.com and it was pretty awesome to watch them go through their life cycle. Our kids were squealing with wonder when the butterflies finally broke out of their chrysalises. Then after a day or two, we took them to a nice wooded area and released them.

        <div class="body">
            So I actually used to work at the Post Office (when I was in my early 20s) and I was an express mail case worker. Essentially what that means is that whenever people had a problem with express mail (overnight and 2nd day mail, depending on origin&#x2F;destination), someone would file a case and it was my problem to research it, solve it, or to conclude it lost, etc.<p>Anyway, virtually all animal shipping happens via Express Mail. So it became my problem to handle most cases involving animal shipping. I worked this job for about 2 years. I will tell you that every day animals die within the USPS. The vast majority die not because of the actual USPS, but because the people shipping the animals did it improperly.<p>Here&#x27;s a short list of specific cases I remember:<p>- Someone shipped a baby alligator. They didn&#x27;t mark it as live animal (because they thought it wasn&#x27;t allowed) or ship it appropriately. The alligator chewed through a portion of the box by the time it arrived at the destination post office. A worker looked through the hole and discovered what they thought was a puppy, so they opened the box to save it and saw it was an exhausted alligator. Local animal control was called and the alligator wasn&#x27;t able to be saved. Animal control disposed of the body. Alligators are actually very commonly shipped and are legal to ship, so if this person had done it correctly the animal would probably have survived.<p>- Rare butterflies were sent from Vietnam via international first class mail, when the box arrived it was flat and all the butterflies were dead. It got escalated to me because no one in first class mail knew how to handle animal cases. I remember this case in excruciating detail because the recipient continued to call and harass me for 3-4 months after this happened. This was a weird borderline case because it was international mail where the sending PO (in Vietnam) allows sending of these animals but local PO (in USA) didn&#x27;t allow receiving of these animals. The guy was hellbent on getting reimbursed for non-insured first class mail. He claims he spent $10,000 on the butterflies. Since it wasn&#x27;t insured we never researched the legitimacy of this amount, nor did he receive any compensation. Eventually Postal Inspectors were called just because of his continued harassment.<p>- Baby Chickens are commonly shipped. I don&#x27;t remember any specific cases because in spring time I was handling 5-10 of these cases EVERY DAY. They also commonly do not survive, even when properly handled and shipped. So get your insurance if you order baby chicks. These are some of the easiest insurance reimbursements I have seen, they get approved faster than almost anything else in the USPS. It&#x27;s insanely common.<p>- Someone shipped a salt water fish of some kind. The fish survived the transport but the recipient said the fish refused to eat because it was so traumatized from our shipping methods. So the fish went on a hunger strike and died a week or so later. They had spent $1,500 on the fish and wanted reimbursement. His reimbursement was denied.<p>- Someone shipped a fertilized Ostrich Egg. They packed it in bubble wrap and had some of those hand warmers inside that you use when skiing. When it was accepted by the recipient, they opened it and discovered the egg had cracked during shipment. Pretty standard boring case at first glance. But the reason I remember it is because the insurance claim was originally rejected because Ostrich was a non-indigenous fowl. Then the recipient sent back a 20 slide powerpoint to me that they created which proved that Ostriches are actually considered farmed-poultry (who knew?). So then I passed it through as approved but it was denied again because of improper packaging. Eggs have to be sent in &quot;hatchery&quot; packaging. I don&#x27;t think that person ever got their insurance claim.<p>- Puppies. People actually try to ship puppies via USPS. Please do not do this ever. You will have Postal Inspectors called and they will fine you and charge you with a felony &amp; animal abuse. Same goes for kittens, although for some reason puppies were more common than kittens. Both are big no-nos. Luckily these usually get caught early on at the origin post office or at the initial sorting facility, so many have been &quot;saved&quot; before they passed away. Animal Control retrieves the animals and they go to the pound&#x2F;shelter. Either way Postal Inspectors get involved 100% of the time in these cases. So its a sure-fire way to get charged with a felony. I remember 2 cases where I was actually able to find lost puppies and save them. One time I spent close to 8 full hours tracking them down. They still go to animal control when they are found, they do not continue onto the recipient. The second time we found the lost puppies it was because the destination PO discovered them and called the police and the Postal Inspectors directly, but never updated the tracking. So the puppies were safe (I think one died in that case).<p>- Bees are very commonly shipped and they make it safely through the mail system 99% of the time. They actually pack them up and store them very well.<p>So what happens when a package gets lost? Well live-animals have the highest priority in the USPS&#x27; case management system. So even if I was behind on cases and working on cases that were submitted days ago, as soon as an live animal case comes in, it immediately moves to the next case above everything else. So they are handled promptly. As a case worker we usually actually picked up the phone to call sorting facilities when we were dealing with a lost animal as opposed to sending emails like usual for information. I&#x27;d say we tracked down around half of all lost animal claims. Some would get discovered &quot;too late&quot;, and many would just get lost for good.<p>What happens when a deceased animal is discovered? If it was an approved animal then it would go to the recipient as usual, sometimes with a note. If the animal was unapproved (like a snake or turtle for example) then Postal Inspectors are called. If it was a larger animal or a mammal like a puppy or kitten, then animal control is usually called to handle the body.<p>Lastly, Ill mention insurance. The way USPS does insurance claims is a headache for everyone. We had a joke when I worked there that the goal was for people to give up on fighting for their insurance claim. Because that is what usually happened. Payouts take 6 months or so on average. There is a lot of back and forth and records need to be immaculate. Most people don&#x27;t have any proof of what they shipped or the value of what they shipped. So claims were rarely approved.<p>Last I mentioned &quot;Postal Inspectors&quot;. These are actual federal agents that oversee USPS claims. They are essentially federal police officers and they can arrest and charge you with felonies. They investigate all sorts of stuff, like mailing drugs, elaborate mail tampering schemes, and so forth. They also handled cases where extreme animal neglect occurs while shipping live animals. So keep that in mind when you ship a live animal against the rules posted on that site, because you can actually get a felony for it (like shipping dogs and stuff).<p>Edit: This was nearly 15 years ago, so some practices and rules might have changed since then.

            You can also do this with praying mantises, but they come as an egg nest. Put them under some leaves and a week or two later baby mantises everywhere eating all the bad things. After a couple months there&#x27;s always a few big ones that stick around. Surprisingly intelligent and curious little things.

            I assume it was a mail-order bride joke? Shrug.<p>I can imagine what would drive someone to enter one of those relationships (from either side), but I can&#x27;t imagine that you&#x27;d feel good about it (on either side).<p>It&#x27;s bad enough dealing with Westerners who seem to be in it for the money.<p>As for our current cultural expectations, I think the idea is supposed to be that you play musical chairs until you hit your mid-to-late thirties, at which point you give up and marry whoever you happen to be with at the time, silently regretting the one that got away.<p>Better? I dunno. It does result in fewer children.<p>People would probably be happier if they married at 18 after their high school prom, and before anyone&#x27;s fortunes were known.

If people are to live an extra 10+ years, start professions 2-3 years later, work many jobs more, buy houses 5+ years later, maybe getting married a few years later isnt all that odd?<p>tbh I did not even think of the mail order bride angle - that would have been much stronger. Do celebrities still do the mail order children thing? Where they pluck some infant out of a refugee camp or warzone and adopt them into the glitz and glamour of hollywood?
