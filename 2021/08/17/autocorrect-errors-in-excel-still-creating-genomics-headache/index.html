            Excel is used as a database&#x2F;storage&#x2F;interchange format, especially after the initial analysis by someone who uses python or R.
Bioinformatician does the analysis, then the PI wants to see it so they can Ctrl-F for genes they are interested in, so out comes an excel document.<p>And really, even if you know python or R, are you really going to fire up a jupyter notebook, load the data, and run pandas queries every time someone in lab meeting or after a talk asks you about this gene or that gene in your data?<p>I think the important question is why is date conversion a default? Would it really break backwards compatibility for MS Excel users if date conversions were explicit instead of automatic? Turning that off by default would fix a lot of this.

Bioinformatician does the analysis</i><p>Sometimes, but the situation is in reality worse than that. Excel is also used as the gold standard database&#x2F;storage&#x2F;interchange format of record for random shit that clinical researchers have typed in by hand whether directly or transcribed from other notes, often when that data isn&#x27;t actually fundamentally tabular in nature because people really like working in grids. Even when grids hurt more than help.<p>A big secret in genetic research is that the MDs, grad students, project managers, and coordinators running the research programs are often not super focused on what well-structured data looks like and don&#x27;t know what things like &quot;key-value store&quot; or &quot;nested tree-like structure&quot; mean, and even if they did there aren&#x27;t good GUI tools for entering them anyway, and it leads to countless errors that maybe (here I speculate) they just assume will wash out as noise.<p>&gt; <i>I think the important question is why is date conversion a default?</i><p>Yes, why any kind of conversion is ever the default is a real money question.

            For the finance and business office worker, it seems to have traction. Just like auto-creating an emoji when you type a : character. Excel is for offices, not specializations of scientists. Bummer.

            The market for scientific software is a bit iffy. Scientific software also needs to be super super flexible since the users are, somewhat by definition, not doing something that&#x27;s been done before. Hard market.

            I don&#x27;t work in bioinformatics, but what you are describing is a completely accurate description of what I experienced working in manufacturing quality control. Raw data came in from suppliers in the form of spreadsheets, and  management wanted to see results in spreadsheets. Meaning all our quality data was subjected to these issues. The date formatting issue was a particularly annoying &quot;gotcha&quot;, particularly when features were defined with a XX-XX numeric code. The number of times I had to deal with someone in a meeting saying &quot;hey, why is this feature called October-13?!&quot; Super frustrating.<p>If I could choose the tools used by the whole process involving multiple different companies and departments, hey I would! It would be python all the way down. But I was but a cog in a massive organization.

            The process I had to deal with was filling out spreadsheets with data from a python-driven 3D inspection program that exported out data files in CSV format. Needless to say, these errors were inevitable for exactly the reasons you&#x27;ve stated. Why we didn&#x27;t bypass the large, poorly formatted cumbersome spreadsheets and just directly export data via pandas? All the inspection was done by Python anyways. You tell me! Also, it did not help that the spreadsheets were not created by me, or any colleagues in my department.<p>God I hated working in old-school engineering&#x2F;manufacturing. &quot;That&#x27;s not how we do things&quot; is the answer to everything.

            It&#x27;s easy to hate on Excel or Microsoft, a &quot;dumb&quot; program and a faceless mega corporation. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m no fan. But the real question is what are journals doing? It seems like the obvious solution is for editors and reviewers to do a quick search for these errors. To me, this is more of an indication of how poor most journals really are.<p>(You could argue that supplementary data should be in an open format, so you could automate this checking. I&#x27;m not against this, either.)

            This is an important point. What have the journals done? Raised their prices and business as usual.<p>Scientific editors do <i>nothing</i> for data validation. There is no accountability, even after retractions.<p>Scientific journal editors are glorified gatekeepers for &quot;high impact&quot; work (read: flashy), and then use free reviewer labor to cover themselves so they can call it &#x27;peer reviewed&#x27;.
In the rare cases when journals do require supporting data, they explicitly ask for excel spreadsheets :(

            If a problem is re-occurring and between lots of people, it&#x27;s probably the fault of the system that powers it. The system in this case is the software, so blaming the software is appropriate.

            No it isn&#x27;t. This isn&#x27;t a gotcha. This is probably one of the most well known software behaviors on the planet.<p>You KNOW the problem exists, yet you STILL choose to use the software, THEN expect it to change its behaviors because its inconvenient for your very specific use case. Microsoft aren&#x27;t going to fix this behavior because there are likely millions if not billions of spreadsheets that rely on it.<p>That is not a software problem.

            People working in large organizations are frequently not even allowed to install software that isn’t pre-approved by N layers of management. The bottom line though is that Excel is made for data entry. If it’s not suitable for that use case, that’s a big problem with the product-market fit.

            ?<p>Excel documents almost always have issues, independent of genomics[0]. I can probably just skim through my emails and find a bunch of problem spreadsheets all over.<p>Fundamentally, the problem is threefold.<p>1) excel tries to be smart, and this works in the easy case and breaks down in the edge cases. The edge cases also tend to appear with larger data entry as various one-offs, so it’s particularly insidious<p>2. Excel is difficult to validate (formulas are hidden, naming things properly is a bit of a hack, no real typechecking, data constraints can be set but it’s hard to check what’s set to what across all cells, etc)<p>3. The typical user &#x2F; target market isn’t trained to use what facilities excel does happen to offer.<p>Ultimately, the problem is that excel doesn’t “scale”, and by default you get the wrong thing.<p>And even if you know how to set things up properly, it’s near impossible to be sure it stays proper.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;88-of-spreadsheets-have-errors-2013-04-17" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;88-of-spreadsheets-have-er...</a>

            Excel isn’t a data entry tool. It’s a rather sophisticated analysis tool for tabular data. It’s success is derived from the fact that it’s very good at this, and is so easy for users to pick up. Mind boggling amounts of commerce and administration are driven my Excel.<p>It is however most suited to accounting and logistics tasks. For any more novel use case, you’re going to have to put some thought into how you use it, or use a more suitable alternative. Even for the tasks that it’s very well suited to, there will always be more sophisticated alternatives. But I’d consider the way it lowers the the technical barriers to entry an overwhelming positive, even if it doesn’t completely absolve the users from learning about how their data works. I have the same frustrations with developers who have been trained by ORMs to have no idea how RDBMSes work. But I consider it their fault for not learning their trade properly, rather than the fault of the people who make nice tools to help them.

            I&#x27;m not saying Excel is without its benefits or a bad tool, just perhaps shouldn&#x27;t be the only one.<p>And I was wondering if people like in the non-engineering but scientific fields, as the ones discussed in post, are exposed to the alternatives during their formation years.<p>If one chooses to use Excel because its the best tool great, but if its because its the perceived only option that&#x27;s probably counterproductive.

            Yeah. At some point though, people who want to do something that requires python or R, but refuse to learn it, and then use Excel (and make mistakes like the article mentions) should reconsider their choices.

            &gt; <i>There&#x27;s several ways to avoid the issue in Excel.</i><p>No, not really. There are several ways to help reduce the issue, but none of them eliminate what it does.<p>Example that comes to mind is the data file for College Board&#x27;s SAT test. The data formats for student reports for schools come in two formats: PDF (one page per student), CSV, and fixed-width. That is the comprehensive list of your options. College Board doesn&#x27;t care about you as a customer. They&#x27;re too big. Any request you submit will be black holed.<p>Some of the columns in the file indicate a range, usually in the format &quot;X-Y&quot;. Excel will try to coerce that into a date, if it&#x27;s valid.<p>Other columns indicate a ratio, expressed as &quot;X&#x2F;Y&quot;. Excel will coerce that into a date, if it&#x27;s valid.<p>Other columns indicate an ID number, expressed as a large, fixed-digit number, zero-padded. Excel will coerce that into an integer, or, if it&#x27;s too long, into scientific notation discarding digits.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how you format the CSV. Excel will do the above.<p>Here&#x27;s an example CSV:<p><pre><code>  ID,Range,Ratio
  12345678901234567890,8-9,&quot;7&#x2F;15&quot;
  &quot;00000000000000012345&quot;,&quot;9-10&quot;,21&#x2F;35
</code></pre>
I open that with Excel and immediately save it as a CSV. I look at the file in a text editor and I see:<p><pre><code>  ID,Range,Ratio
  1.23457E+19,9-Aug,15-Jul
  12345,10-Sep,21&#x2F;35
</code></pre>
Do you have any idea how fun it is to explain to teachers and school administrators what happened here?<p>The correct way to work with this data file is: Do not, under any circumstances, open it with Excel if you expect to use it for anything else.<p>The problem is, there are very few applications that work well with CSV files. I know of CsvEd and Delimit. There are several text editors with a CSV column mode that makes the file look like a table (with varying degrees of success). All of these vary between &quot;godawful&quot; and &quot;a complete nightmare&quot; in terms of performance and usability compared to Excel.

            &gt; It doesn&#x27;t matter how you format the CSV. Excel will do the above.<p>Only if you <i>open</i> the file, so that Exel assumes defaults for formatting. If you <i>import</i> the CSV (Data -&gt; From Text in the current UI) you can specify the format with the Import Text Wizard as described on the College Board instructions for using the file. Except...<p>Unfortunately, the College Board has outdated instructions on their website; Excel used to offer the Import Text Wizard on opening a csv or text file, rather than making default assumptions, and the College Board instructions page, while it does tell you to use that Import Text Wizard and provide all the details of what to plug into that wizard, tells you to open the file to get it, which bypasses the wizard.<p>Things like this is why clerical and other low-level positions involving excel test candidates on proficiency with specific versions of excel.

            Yeah, that&#x27;s also obnoxious. The Data From Text wizard lets you easily import the data... but if you do that then the first row no longer defaults to headers. So if you open it that way and want to filter or sort the data, your headers will disappear. You have to go into full blown Power Query to do both prevent reformatting and use column headers, and you have to reassign the data types on a much more complex interface.<p>We have now changed a 1 second automated process that anybody could do, into a 2 minute manual process that requires knowledge of data types. We&#x27;ve gone from a non-technical task to a highly technical task. To open a file without completely munging the data.<p>It also will sometimes do weird things like exclusive lock the file on disk until you close every open window of Excel because it creates data connections to the file.

            As a biomedical researcher who prefers using python &amp; R over Excel:<p>(1) Graduate students (who are the bulk of the scientific labor force) usually have some training in python, R, or Matlab, but are seldom practiced in applying it to real-world work.  So if a lab standardizes on python, R, etc. the senior people have to do a lot of extra work to support the programming, rather than doing work with intrinsic scientific value.  It&#x27;s easier to teach the Excel quirks than to teach effective programming practices.  Excel quirks are concrete, and &quot;good practices&quot; in programming are vague and situational.<p>(2) Python &amp; R have their own pitfalls.  It&#x27;s easy to apply the wrong filters to a data set and compare subsets that aren&#x27;t what you think you&#x27;re comparing.  Although when they go wrong, they go very wrong, and this is easier for a supervisor to notice.<p>(3) Excel has rich text formatting, graph embedding, and data types, so it&#x27;s very useful as a human-readable data interchange &amp; summary format even if you never do computation in it.<p>IMO neither programming languages nor Excel are a great fit for data analysis.  Something purpose-made, like JMP or even GraphPad, is probably the better choice in most situations.  Programming gets you automation but at the cost of high complexity.  Since you still need to look at and think about the data there&#x27;s a limit to how much time automation can save (Amdahl&#x27;s law).

            I work in bioinformatics and have seen the issue.<p>You get data from a lot of sources, and people (like me) just sometimes forget to check the spreadsheet.  Often a csv file so it’s not clear it’s been generated by excel.  It’s also only a problem for gene symbols (not entrez gene IDs or flybase gene numbers).   Also the datasets are big, so there are 15 genes in error over the whole dataset it can be hard to spot.<p>Honestly genes are a constantly moving target and are kinda a pain to write software for.

            I took a programming for math majors course in college, and the largest challenge for the class was understanding procedural looping to process data sets. Understanding a for loop or a while loop really was a hard concept for someone to understand. We didn&#x27;t cover any real data structures, and everything was a 2 dimensional array.<p>Excel, and most spreadsheets for that, avoid some of the basic control structures beginners find challenging. Many functions are basically map and reduce functions so you typically are getting the same number of cells back, or one. Often maps are done visually in the spreadsheet with a formula being applied to every cell in a column.

            I think there is a difference between the errors. Excel autocorrect errors are easy to miss as it is the software making an arbritrary decision over your own.<p>Errors made from using a new , presumably neutral software, would be the kind you are supposed to catch as a researcher.<p>There is obviously scope for error in everything but Excel&#x27;s user-hostile methods are not justified by this.

            &gt; But this would come at the cost of not being able to mix types in column, and a lot of people want to be able to mix.<p>I feel like a lot of the desire for this comes from Excel&#x27;s desire to fill the screen with a single infinite spreadsheet. Apple&#x27;s Numbers and some other programs make it more natural to have multiple separate tables on screen, each of which can have their own header rows and columns and separate type and format rules for those columns&#x2F;rows. Excel more or less forces people to emulate this capability by just using a separate region of the same table, which gets in the way of applying consistent formatting and typing rules to whole columns or rows.

            Let&#x27;s say you have 100,000 rows of data, and in a column all but 3 of those values look like dates.

            &gt; A reasonable alternative would be for example statically typing each column or row in the sheet.<p>Excel actually supports this out of the box. But it&#x27;s one more option to set, and people get lazy.

            Also those properties are lost if you transfer the data to another format then back, or don&#x27;t properly survive copy&#x2F;cut&#x2F;paste operations (often cutting will remove everything about a cell including options such as these).<p>As well as being easy to be lazy and not use the options, it is easy to accidentally undo them also.

            If an excel spreadsheet is setup properly, this conversion doesn&#x27;t happen. If the cells are designated as &quot;text&quot;, then conversion doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>This is definitely a problem if you are just opening a raw CSV file and editing it as the default cell type does allow autoconversion.

            Except from personal experience I can tell you that even when you go out of your way to set the correct data types, if you try to copy paste any data into those cells excel will ignore everything you set and try to automatically change the data types.<p>If you know how to get it to never do that sort of thing, please let me know, because this is causing major issues in production software...

            Autocorrect(and predictive text) has reached an interesting milestone, good enough that you mainly rely on it, but occasionally it distorts the data you intended to send. Disengaging the technology isn&#x27;t easy, or even understanding field types it shouldn&#x27;t correct(everyday my work VPN auth window tries to autocorrect my username). There is so much context that is unavailable to the computer, and there is no good way to provide it.<p>I think it has interesting implications for self-driving, since as far as I can tell we&#x27;re at an earlier but similar stage in its development; works for simple situations, likely to drive you into a wall for no reason. We build so much trust in these systems, we stop paying attention to what they are doing, and then pay the price when it behaves in an unexpected way to the user.

            I get bitten by Excel&#x27;s auto-correct all the time and I work nothing related to genomics. It&#x27;s in my opinion just a dumb decision of Microsoft to not let you disable all those smarty feats (like, thinking you have a date if your string kinda looks like one)

            I generally am very critical of my own gang ( programmers ) for being so into their own bubble they completely lose perspective of the real World, and with that ignorance comes the usual arrogance.<p>But this time I feel we should give the business to the geneticists. The Excel &quot;problem&quot; is known and has been known for a long time, finance guys and policy makers were maybe the first big ones to &quot;discover&quot; this for slightly different reasons.<p>Then WHY on Earth these top professionals, elites, &quot;creme de la creme&quot; people continue on this path? And it&#x27;s not like they love Excel, quite the contrary. Yes, the main reason is they are not programmers so they need to find a way to hack something to solve their problem. The problem with their &quot;problem&quot; solving is they are being slobs in a work that requires the EXACT opposite.<p>&quot;Oh now we need to hire a programmer too?&quot; - Yes, you do.<p>&quot;But we don&#x27;t have the budget for it&quot; - Yes, you do. You see, money is never enough for anything, it&#x27;s a question of priorities and when you blow millions of dollars with fancy experiments to ruin your career because of Excel, maybe that Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Julia guy was a bargain after all.<p>I know some of these people, and under the aura of lab coats and distinguished professors it&#x27;s just some guy&#x2F;gal trying to crank that paper ASAP to keep the hamster wheel spinning AND they are being sloppy about the data and process AND most of them know it.<p>Sorry, but no excuses.

            The underlying assumption here is that when transferred into R or Julia, with an equivalent level of development effort and testing, that there will be no&#x2F;fewer bugs. I&#x27;m not entirely sure that&#x27;s true.<p>I think we are comparing something that is knocked out in an hour in excel to someone spending 4-10x of the time doing it in Python &#x2F; Julia, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a like-for-like comparison.

            Serious question, is this a viable area for a startup product? Obviously nothing will easily displace Excel for general spreadsheet work, but I could see room for a domain-specific spreadsheet that has core features and supports just a basic set of functions relevant to genomics, + a &quot;we won&#x27;t fuck up your data&quot; feature.

            Hi - I&#x27;m building a networked spreadsheet product and had heard of this auto-correct problem in genomics research through word of mouth a couple of times, so have asked this question myself. (I was astonished to learn just how much of genomics work involves sending Excel files back and forth!) Here&#x27;s the conclusion that I have come to:<p>- It&#x27;s definitely possible to build a custom spreadsheet product with a small team, even one targeted at such a &quot;niche&quot; user group. So it&#x27;s an idea worth testing.<p>- Product can be &quot;backwards compatible&quot; - you can export to xlxs and import from xlxs - so you don&#x27;t have to change behaviour of the entire industry on day one to get this to work, only a single genomics researcher or lab.<p>- Pricing, unit economics, etc are unknown to me (I have no background in genomics or scientific research). But presumably you could leverage standard SaaS models and build a viable model up from there using a few case studies. There&#x27;s definitely schleppy behaviour going on here that can be solved.<p>- Even a &quot;lifestyle business&quot; has significant upside beyond the financial: improving genomics research improves genomic research!<p>- The product advantage over time presumably involve building more custom tooling into the genomics &#x2F; data ecosystem. &quot;Not creating typos&quot; is just the beachhead.<p>I&#x27;ve never actually interviewed genomics people about their need here, but if anyone knows people with this problem I would love to talk to them: @mceoin on twitter.

            You&#x27;d be surprised how much effort can be saved by not relying on human interaction to be reliable.<p>Though convincing people to switch to a new app for that reason, even if it were free and Free, would still be an uphill struggle.<p><i>&gt; just formatting your cells as text before entering the values</i><p>It is a little more than that. I work with finance people, and there a lot of data is <i>manipulated</i> in Excel but passed around as CSV files for compatibility elsewhere. This causes no end of problems because fixes by setting cell properties are obviously lost in transcription, and date errors creep in as things are moved back &amp; forth between people in the US and those in locales that do dates properly.
