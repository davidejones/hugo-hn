            Big fan of DCSS, but this doesn&#x27;t surprise me. After getting a few all rune wins I stopped playing largely because it is so opaque. Even after spending a LOT of quality time with the (sometimes incorrect) wiki and in-game lookup system, I realized I would never have an intuitive sense of the effects of my choices wrt stats, skilling, weapon and armor choices, and so on. I watched some of the best crawl players in the world play to see how they approached these very common situations and even there I didn&#x27;t see as much consensus as I hoped to find given common scenarios.<p>Part of the joy of being human is understanding systems and working with them efficiently to achieve goals. Good luck doing that with crawl. You can sort of achieve this by dumping a lot of time and building up intuition via experience, but you still won&#x27;t be able to say why you chose this over that for all your choices.<p>I found myself getting into scenarios, wondering, which choice is better along one particular dimension? STR vs DEX? This armor vs that? What are the trade-offs? The only real way to find that out would be to dump the game at its current state and then simulate both choices against a suite of enemies to see how it plays out at least in 1v1 situations, never mind when handling many enemies. It&#x27;s frustrating playing a game with so many numbers yet the output of the systems they feed into are so opaque.<p>It&#x27;s really unfortunate because although it already feels like a gem of a game, it could be soo much better if the interplay of the various combat &#x2F; character systems wasn&#x27;t so ridiculously complected. I would <i>love</i> to see some of the sensibilities of the Factorio team applied to crawl&#x27;s UI and underlying combat&#x2F;character systems.

            It&#x27;s worth noting that at least in recent versions, the in game formulas have been getting simplified. For instance armor used to give you both AC and GDR (guaranteed damage resistance), whereas now GDR is a direct function of AC regardless of its source. Similarly DEX now more directly influences Evasion, whereas before it was artificially capped to give very diminishing returns past ~25 DEX, and now allows you to get very high Evasion.

            That&#x27;s good to hear. I hope they keep going down that path. To refer to another game, in any of the Soulsborne games (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, ...) by From Software, as you level up you get to contribute points towards stats which affects your ability to wield weapons and how much damage they do. You don&#x27;t even have to equip them, the game gives you a diff of what your new damage will be along various dimensions (physical, magic, etc) as well as how your &quot;equip load&quot; is affected just by inspecting it. Although this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you can understand the difference between a really heavy, highly damaging weapon vs a fast weapon, by reading a wiki or by playing through once or twice you&#x27;ll have a very good base understanding of what different weapons bring to the table and how your character drives those strengths&#x2F;weaknesses.<p>With DCSS? Well... how much damage you do is going to depend on whether or not you&#x27;re wearing a shield (what size?), what kind of armor you&#x27;re wearing if any, how much you&#x27;ve trained for that weapon class, how much STR you have, what bonuses it has, and what bonuses you have from gear. Then RNG will play a significant role on top of that. Maybe RNG applies twice, once for your swing, once for their defense? It&#x27;s been too long, I can&#x27;t say confidently.<p>I realize it&#x27;s challenging for the interface design because everything is already tight but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a solution. If I equip this armor&#x2F;weapon&#x2F;jewelry, how fast will I be attacking compared to now? What will my damage distribution look like before enemy resistances? Same with allocating stats, please give feedback in the form of derived data that is closer to the thing I care about (surviving).

            I don&#x27;t think the problem is complexity as much as it is opaqueness. I have played other games that are also very complex but yet still very enjoyable because the complexity is open to be examined.

            The opacity is a remnant from the game as it was designed twenty years ago, which took cues from roguelikes of the day such as NetHack (which is famous for its opacity). The developers of Stone Soup have spent a few decades improving the interface with the goal that you shouldn&#x27;t <i>need</i> any external wikis or resources to win: all info should be in the game itself. For example, a relatively recent-ish change is that you can inspect enemies and see a list of all possible spells that they can cast, along with estimates of the damage that each spell will do. A much older feature is the in-game help menu, which is impressively thorough and will give you a high-level overview of every monster, spell, stat, ability, item, god, level, status effect, and so on (although it&#x27;s not necessarily super-detailed when it comes to obscure things like calculating damage; simplifying these calculations is the only way to go).

            That actually sounds nice. Compared to most other &quot;competitive” games, where there is an optimal meta way of playing it, and doing anything else is basically trolling and instant loss

            In some sense, yes, but in another, not so much. Crawl is quite difficult and you&#x27;re always a few steps away from death if you don&#x27;t react to different situations appropriately. It can take players months to years to get their first win. Some people are never able to beat it before giving up on it. There&#x27;s still an optimal way to play in most situations, but many couldn&#x27;t tell you what that optimum is beyond some rules of thumb which aren&#x27;t always right.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there&#x27;s a lot of gold in those hills and I had a lot of fun getting better and getting my first win. But after that I was very frustrated with how hard it was to just stop at a fork in the road and try to answer, which choice is objectively better? I like difficult games that are fair and require skill growth to succeed in, but I want to be able to understand them so I can make informed choices as I get better as well. Too much: because that&#x27;s what the black box determined. sorry, you died. should have been more cautious.

            Isn&#x27;t this what this is though? There are certain builds where if you follow them to a T, then the game is &quot;easy&quot; and you win almost always. If you just experiment then yeah you can win by some crazy stroke of luck, but most likely you will just have a bad time.<p>I had the same experience in Caves of Qud(which is great btw) - there are some builds that really really really work, and others which are unwinnable.

            No not really. Very few builds will let you win the game easily. Situational awareness is required. Relatively few enemies in the game are just melee brutes. Most of them occupy some niche that requires you to think. They can confuse your character, or lock all the doors, or summon, or irresistibly cut your health in half, etc. An exceptionally fortunate character, say, a kung fu octopode transmutated into statue form and wearing 8 magical rings of power can probably karate chop their way through 99.9% of the game without much of a worry, but may still lose in a 1:1 slug fest with certain lords of hell.<p>There are easier builds and there are harder builds, but if you aren&#x27;t good, you will lose. Case in point, the bug described here effectively doubled damage output and win rates were still pretty low.

            Although it&#x27;s worth noting that there are different degrees of &quot;winning the game&quot;. Only three runes are required to win, but maximizing your score and prestige will require you to get all fifteen runes. If you&#x27;re just going for a three-rune victory, then there are more-or-less &quot;safe&quot; builds. For example, a Minotaur of any melee class, or a Berserker of any species that isn&#x27;t completely inept at melee can reliably win a three-rune (not a guaranteed victory obviously, you still need to know what you&#x27;re doing, and most importantly when to run away), although these characters are going to have a very hard time in the extended endgame without some sort of pivot.

            Sounds like the game isn&#x27;t made for you then.<p>This would be like attempting to play Go, and complaining that it&#x27;s nothing like Chess because the optimal move generally isn&#x27;t obvious even after 10,000 hours of play.

            Re your first paragraph, sure, and I&#x27;m fine with that.

There&#x27;s nothing intuitive about being completely unable of knowing the practical effects of something as simple as equipping a piece of armor or a shield or allocating a point to STR vs DEX. I gave an example in another comment of how other games do provide information when comparing between options so you can intuit their effects. I have faith they&#x27;ll get there, though. I believe they&#x27;ll gain many more players if they can, too. :) I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back in a year or two after they improve the gameplay more.

            Yes, there&#x27;s an interesting distinction here. Although I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more like Chess than Go, in the sense the mechanics are really simple in Go, while Chess has specific rules for each piece and you should memorize openings and quirks to get an edge (Go is much more about generalization).<p>In reality, both Chess and Go and all board games are fairly simple, you can learn all the rules in a few sittings and then just focus on strategy.<p>In roguelikes, often <i>learning the system</i> is the point (or a point) of the game. The fun, at least to me, is in dealing with the unknown and discovering how it works and what works.<p>Nethack (a classic roguelike) takes it to the extreme -- a bit too much in fact, because an essential game mechanic is an obscure passage you&#x27;d have to deduct (Elbereth). But the fun is there: you grab a potion and have <i>no idea</i> what happens if you drink it -- maybe you will be killed instantly, maybe it will make you into a god -- it&#x27;s not just &quot;which of those effects am I going to get?&quot;. You have to rely on previous knowledge, as well as expectations from similar games and what you know about the game.<p>But isn&#x27;t that quite common IRL? Like, okay figuring out what you should be eating has a science to back it (albeit quite extensive): you read the most effective diets, what risks it reduces, you health, your weight and need to make a decision. Already not very simple strategic decision. And then you need to take into account satisfying your tastes, how often diet fads reverse (is eating butter healthy? go figure), how to do it when sharing a meal with other people, and so on. The unknowns are as significant as skillful strategic planning. The same could be said to running a company: you need to manage uncertainties in a vast decision space, with opportunities like calling for partnerships, merging, buying other companies, spending on uncertain research, and much more. You slowly acquire domain-specific knowledge (with help from the vast literature, plus a few insights of yours) and use that to in turn reduce and manage uncertainties and plan ahead (here your model of other players and capability to find the &#x27;best move&#x27; -- least risky, greatest payoff, more robust -- will shine).

            The term common in MMOs is theorycrafting, and it gained particular momentum in an era where some common games allowed for addons that could export telemetry data. Contrived or common scenarios could be mined (Monte Carlo simulations if you will) to determine how patterns lined up with theories.

            I don&#x27;t think this is player stupidity at all. Actually, I suspect it&#x27;s perfectly rational.<p>The game is so noisy that no one can really predict what will happen. If I hit the grue with my sword--it could reasonably do 10% of damage or 40%--and both seem plausible.<p>In a statistical sense, the greater the <i>standard deviation</i> is, the more difficult it is to detect a sample population that differs from the <i>established distribution</i>.<p>In a bayesian sense, the players may have been perfectly rational--the likelihood of doubling or tripling your winrate is just not very unlikely when you&#x27;re playing a game which is very random. Perhaps players can rationally conclude they were in the top 1% of luck at the moment, and that the chance of a major bug is less than that.<p>As evidenced by the referenced posts, it only becomes obvious when the sample size is huge (eg. the sample of all players reading the subreddit).

            Yes. It&#x27;s very similar to when you encounter compiler or operating system or hardware bug as a programmer.<p>You are trained for years to NEVER BLAME THE LOWER LAYERS because that makes you a worse programmer. So when it is actually their fault - you might look stupid for exhausting every other possibility before checking these basic assumptions.<p>But this is still a good rule, because it breaks very rarely.

            I&#x27;ve had a bug in linux driver for a very shitty touchscreen we used in our embedded devices. It needed manual calibration  and you had to save the calibration matrix in a config file read on system startup. They used locale-aware input function in a driver so when the locale was German (or other with &quot;,&quot; as a decimal separator) it broke and users got kernel panic at startup :)<p>It bricked all our devices in Germany.<p>We worked around it, notified the device driver developers and forgot about it.<p>A year later we shipped with new version of kernel and it broke again - because the bug was fixed in kernel and our workaround was now causing the bug :)

            One of the most interesting insights I retained from my machine learning course from a couple of decades ago is that you can put a mathematical bound on how quickly you can learn from a given set of data, and how much you can learn. In the situations presented by the real world this is often not very interesting because we can only process such a vanishing fraction of the data available that we&#x27;re so far below this theoretical optimum that it&#x27;s uninteresting, but in more constrained situations it can be relevant.<p>In this case, while I agree that there was enough data to have a good guess that something had gone wrong after a certain period of time, it definitely is the sort of noisy data that would take some non-trivial aggregation to be <i>sure</i>, and even in hindsight I&#x27;m not so sure the signal was so strong that it&#x27;s worth metaphorically beating anyone up about.<p>Moreover, only in hindsight is it obvious that the culprit was a doubling of melee damage. Prior to knowing that, the learning rate was constrained by the multiplicity of possible theories that could have explained this. It&#x27;s not like it was simply a matter of &quot;Either 1. the game is unchanged and people have just Got Gud or 2. the melee damage rate has been doubled&quot;, the span of possibilities was <i>much</i> larger than that. Had an oracle come down from whereever and offered that choice to the devs, sure, gathering enough data to resolve that one bit&#x27;s worth of information would have been easy. But presented with the full, massive array of possibilities, it&#x27;s a much harder task to even determine that there <i>is</i> a problem, let alone what it is.<p>Upshot, don&#x27;t beat yourselves up <i>too</i> much. It may be obvious in hindsight but these are really quite hard problems to solve in the deliberate absence of information.

            Assuming your win rate goes from 2% -&gt; 4%, you need around 200 samples to be 90% confident that something is up, 270 to be 95% confident, and 450 to be 99% confident, if you start with a Beta(2, 98) prior. Obviously results will change somewhat depending on the model.

            From the article:<p>&gt; Parthenocarpy:<p>&gt; Well that explains me going from a 2% winrate to 17.95% in the span of two weeks<p>In that case, as soon as you got more than 1 win you should notice an abnormality (according to back-of-the napkin 8 trials to perceive the difference, using frequentist stat).<p>Also, that assumes you only get information from win&#x2F;loss.

            For that drastic a difference you need to play about 30 games on average to be 99% sure that p_win&gt;0.02 in the Bayesian model.<p>Agreed that win rates are not the only data available, and that players probably should have noticed the difference.  Attributing it to a bug is arguably a harder problem.

            With the exception of photovoltaic cells, all the other ways we generate electricity ultimately generate the electricity by spinning a dynamo - directly for hydro and wind, and through boiling water to steam for fossil, most solar plants (which use mirrors to heat water in pipes), nuclear, geothermal. Not sure if fusion would generate the electricity directly or also heat up water to spin up some magnets.

            I play online games that have variable winrates bc you’re playing with a match made team. If I go on a 5 game win streak, did I improve? Is the game bugged? Nah, I probably got lucky and got good teammates. If I go on a 5 game loss streak, that’s definitely what I’m telling myself.<p>There’s an element of luck in roguelikes too. It’s part of what makes both types of games compelling. The outcome is uncertain when you sit down to play.<p>So are there psychological traits that make players likely to mistake this bug? Maybe. But on an individual basis, without aggregated winrate data, how would I know it’s not just a lucky winstreak? Especially when I’m playing a style of game where that’s the point?

            Also, over time, the book wears out, so someone makes a copy. Mistakes and misunderstandings creep in. Or, even, the copyist changes a few things to better fit his world view. It is possible that the book isn&#x27;t as static as you think.

            As others have pointed out, degradation and imperfect copying are serious issues, they can&#x27;t really be ignored. Also, language itself changes over time, adding significant difficulty to understanding what the book was supposed to have said. And of course, metaphor and references to then-well-known people or events become unrecognizable very quickly.

            In my day job I manage ~8 deep learning models that make decisions automatically. I adjust 3 inputs, and the models output a lot of data that I use to make adjustments the next day. The issue is.. its incredibly muddy. Making the same change across models, according to documentation, will produce similar results.<p>Having only had this job for a couple months I honestly cannot tell if the input -&gt; output is just very very muddy, or if the documentation is wrong and the models all behave differently. Similar to Crawl I can&#x27;t see behind the curtain.. my inputs are generic &quot;factor 1&quot;, &quot;factor 2&quot; and my outputs have more meaning but are subject to unknowable fluctuations from outside sources.<p>&gt; holding the system constant enough that you can evaluate your changes over time<p>I do not know if I can learn from the system because I&#x27;m not sure if its trustworthy. Good thing there are directions on how to test it included in the post :)

            To give another example of a bug in DCSS that went unnoticed for a while: there&#x27;s a spell called Ozocubu&#x27;s Refrigeration that for 6 months [1] dealt 1&#x2F;3 the damage that it should have. It was considered very weak with a steep drawback before this (for a short duration after casting, you couldn&#x27;t drink any potions), so it was ignored, and no one really questioned why it was useless.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crawl&#x2F;crawl&#x2F;commit&#x2F;ab847a317b82e2fb0316bf19c0c5e8f66163f2a7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crawl&#x2F;crawl&#x2F;commit&#x2F;ab847a317b82e2fb0316bf...</a>

            &gt; ... remember that the Systemic Stability Principle is completely false, and just happens to be a false belief that it’s often useful to hold. A system being stable in the past doesn’t mean it’s stable now, and evidence that the Systemic Stability Principle works is not the same thing as evidence that it’s right.<p>That is, the only way you can get better at a game like this is to assume that the system is stable (otherwise you&#x27;ll attribute failure to bad luck instead of bad strategy).<p>&gt; It’s also important to avoid refuting observations by appealing to system definitions. If someone says “This feels like it’s doing more damage than it says”, resist the impulse to say “Nope, it does exactly this value; it’s written right here.” Instead, try to design an experiment that would prove whether the value written in the system is correct. If designing the experiment is very hard, that should be interpreted as a risk factor - if no one can check that the system is doing what it ought to, then maybe it really is wrong! Play yes-and with systems skeptics, letting them invest their time into correspondence work if they think something is wrong. Or be the system skeptic yourself, if a certain observation sits wrong with you.<p>That skill is a superpower in software development when dealing with complex systems that behave unexpectedly.

            I&#x27;m a former DCSS player. I actually love the opacity and lack of documentation in the game. One of the truly enchanting elements of older rogue likes was the randomness, undocumented features, and various other things along those lines. It has been very sad to see crawl lose a lot of these elements as the pave of development has increased... The new player base wants everything to be optimal and so has gradually militated for the removal of the more unique and strange elements of the game play.<p>Simplified combat and magic, removal of extraneous skills, crippled food system... soon no doubt they&#x27;ll try to &#x27;balance&#x27; the mutation system which is the last of these old school rogue like features to still maintain a large presence.<p>I think the dispute is generational... I love crawl and had some modest victories but never defined myself around it.  to me it was a distraction and just a fun game to sink time into in undergrad - not something to be relentlessly optimized.

            The question is &quot;why didn&#x27;t the players notice&quot; not why the developers didn&#x27;t notice.<p>The article leads with a clickbait question.<p>The reason they didn&#x27;t notice is because the stats aren&#x27;t readily available and public to everyone, to see the sharp uptick in wins paired with the game being filled with opaque systems. No player playing for the first time would notice or have a chance to notice.<p>To put it another way, this is an article about a (secret and mistaken) massive change to a very difficult game that made it slightly less difficult. Same article turns around and asks why nobody noticed, like that&#x27;s an interesting question.

            <i>&gt; the stats aren&#x27;t readily available and public to everyone</i><p>The stats have always been public and instantly available, impressively so.

            It&#x27;s not a stupid question at all, it&#x27;s actually a good pretext to discuss the difficulties inherent in reasoning about an opaque system you are interacting with.<p>The article also brings evidence that many players didn&#x27;t notice or believe that anything changed, they specifically believed that nothing did change, which is a surprising belief for such a huge change - but understandable in the context of of such an opaque system.

            This is an interesting idea. Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a new feature where electric damage and cold damage ignores metal armor. But suddenly there&#x27;s a bug where if the weapon does both electric <i>and</i> cold damage, the physical damage also ignores armor.<p>How would someone design tests that work well for roguelikes? It&#x27;s not simply Human strikes Orc for 10 damage. Damage range may be a bell curve of 5-15. There&#x27;s misses and hits. There&#x27;s little bonuses that increase the miss probability, probably to ridiculous levels. There&#x27;s armor, calculated from things like race, constitution, magic, divine bonuses, class mastery bonus.<p>And then you have procedurally generated... stuff. Equipment are the easiest to control. Some games have procedurally generated monsters, some have procedurally generated deities. To be able to reduce this stuff to tests kind of defeats the purpose of doing it, which is to be unpredictable.<p>Sometimes you have a combo of things that add up to 40% damage resistance. Is 40% too much or too little?<p>After all this, how do you detect that the bugged spear is doing an unreasonable amount of damage?

            Monte Carlo simulation? Have your CI server run millions of games in fast forward, and collect as many statistics as you can. When you make a change, check that the stats that you expected to change did change, and that others stayed the same.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t detect extremely improbable things, though, like having a spear with a super-rare effect + having armour with another super-rare effect, since those would show up so infrequently that they wouldn&#x27;t skew the overall stats much.

            B seems fine. But wouldn&#x27;t a RNG seed give different results as you add more randomly generated features?

            It sure would be inconvenient for your hypothesis if the crawl project had a `test` directory which predates the bug in question...

            &gt; try to design an experiment that would prove whether the value written in the system is correct. If designing the experiment is very hard, that should be interpreted as a risk factor - if no one can check that the system is doing what it ought to, then maybe it really is wrong!
