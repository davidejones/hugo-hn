            Don&#x27;t go.<p>My young friend went on contract for a year, doing fishery research. After a few months they said &quot;We aren&#x27;t going to pay you any more. You can&#x27;t leave because the boat won&#x27;t come back until {whenever}. And if you say anything, we won&#x27;t give you the recommendation you need as a young researcher doing a PhD.&quot;<p>She had to stay for months working for nothing.

            I stopped at M.S., but I know many Ph.D.&#x27;s.<p>The horror stories of things they endure would fill hundreds of volumes. One told me another prof just <i>stole</i> her dissertation topic, and she lost two years. Innumerable others get caught in academic politics because another prof doesn&#x27;t like theirs.<p>As many people say below, being a whistleblower brings a heavy personal cost, and no one should say &quot;you should publicize this&quot; without being aware of that.

            Academia is a ridiculous racket at this point.<p>The ratio of people that can make a living doing research to people that are entering PhD programs is way, way off, which naturally produces a zero-sum hypercompetition &quot;market&quot; among PhD students that can only end in &quot;success&quot; by people able and willing to work crazy hard for no money for years on end - aka the already-rich, the desperate true believers, the delusional, or some combination of those three.<p>To make things worse, all the money in universities is being sucked up by the explosion of the self-licking ice cream cone of middle management catering to the &quot;student experience&quot; or whatever else.<p>Look up the absolute explosion of management salaries in universities in the last 20 years.

            she had to stay, ok. but why keep working? Jobs can be scarce on an island but maybe you can find something that pays more than zero. Or work remote. Or just take vacation if you have some reserve

            Whistleblowing can severely hurt you, from destroying your career to killing you. People who demand it blindly probably haven&#x27;t ever had to make a hard choice about it.<p>I recommend against it in almost all cases for people I care about, because people have this natural infatuation for victims that is obviously prurient (whether it&#x27;s love, reverence, hate, or even disgust) and you yourself are going to end up the center of the storm.<p>If they decide to do it anyway because they&#x27;re better people than me. I try to make sure they don&#x27;t do it stupidly, and work with them on a careful plan that minimizes their personal danger and has the best chance of succeeding.

            In the book &quot;Close Calls&quot; by Stratis Kas, Dr. Sonia Rowley tells a heartbreaking story of having to endure constant sexual harassment from one of her colleagues during a field research expedition. She was already a PhD and nominally in charge but decided not to blow the whistle because that would have set her research back by years.

            Without commenting on the policy I think you&#x27;re missing the maths.<p>I can earn $x here or $(x - y) to be in the uk. In the UK I get healthcare on the NHS. I move. I quit &#x2F; am fired &#x2F; co goes (creatively?) broke. And I keep the healthcare on the NHS and have time to start a family before deportation etc.<p>Think about large values of y or indeed kickbacks. Does the firm really want &#x2F;me&#x2F;? Or do they just want cash which they get by paying very low (or taking a fee from me) as I get an end run around the immigration system to get healthcare without making the contribution, queue jumping better qualified, harder working, more civic minded people with greater compassionate grounds for being accepted? As ever there&#x27;s a continuum. &quot;Clearly this person is legitimately... ...then the unexpected thing happened.&quot; ends up being harder and quite expensive to identify and enforce fairly and equitably with a public service doing so.<p>I say nothing of the UK&#x27;s policy here or its implementation as I&#x27;m ignorant. Assuming entrepreneurs won&#x27;t spring up to arbitrage any system hole they can is naive. Immigration is super-emotive at the best of times especially arbitrarily unfair treatment and those who feel like they&#x27;re losing from it (rightly or wrongly).<p>That&#x27;s the general case being made. Immigration policy is super hard and you kind of have to willfully fortify your compassion as well. More than 700 million people on this planet have no safe drinking water and would want to migrate to any wealthy country under almost any circumstance. Plenty are literally dying to do it. How can we not feel for them? Being compassionate reduces to deciding how many people your country can take easily, with effort, or the level in which society collapses. 700m immigrating in a year will probably achieve collapse.<p>&quot;What then must we do?&quot;<p>I haven&#x27;t got a good answer or indeed a better one than fight corruption everywhere and anywhere under all circumstances.

This is being played out in real time as the UK decides how many of the people who the Taliban will execute as our collaborators it should allow to be rescued.<p>(asylum and the refugee system is technically separate from immigration in international law, but this is a distinction few people seem to care about. And this is also separate as nobody should realistically expect an Afghan translator for the British Army to find £650 to save their life)<p>I wonder how many Afghans we could safely relocate to the Falklands?

            &gt; There is no queue.<p>Any country that has a number of people who would like to immigrate of whom it will not accept all and will chose who to reject has a queue. How that queue is implemented, orderly, disorderly, corruptly, unjustly, ridiculously, incompetently or at various times all of the above. Some get in, some don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a queue. It may not be a fantasy of an orderly queue where everyone is served in order in good time and without knowing about it, it does not surprise me to hear you say it is emphatically not that.
Think of a priority queue if you must with priority being given by a random number generator tempered with both nonsense and corruption. You jump places in the queue by being designated higher priority. Have you jumped forward enough to be accepted and if not what can you do about it - this is the only question for those trying to get in.<p>Who are you taking vs who are you rejecting? That&#x27;s if you&#x27;re already in. You can&#x27;t take everyone. The world is a nasty place and this is one of the emotional sharp edge of it. You will reject people whose stories break your heart. You don&#x27;t get a choice about that.

            Obviously the priority is &#x2F;meant&#x2F; to be sensibly arrived at. The rest was commentary on how sensible it is likely to actually be in practice, with a nod to your assertions about it which seem at least plausible. I simply don&#x27;t believe decisions are entirely independent. I strongly doubt the public servants making those decisions have it in the power to increase the rate of immigration tenfold based on individuals meeting criteria without political support. The process is inherently a rate limiting thing.<p>&gt;Why? Who is &quot;you&quot; here?<p>&quot;You&quot; is anyone putting themselves in the shoes of coming up with an immigration policy. Spare a thought for any decent human being who actually has to get their hands properly dirty and do it. I may not be a decent human because I think I would run from that opportunity without hesitation. I doubt I have the psychological strength to try for a least worse policy that will bring about misery. There is no stroke of my pen where I wouldn&#x27;t be seeing millions of people dying any one of whom I could have saved with a different stroke. I&#x27;m not sure I can live with that. But I can&#x27;t really absolve myself of the responsibility for what happens as a voting eligible person in a democracy. On that basis I have to at least consider what current policies are and competing ones that might be somehow a little less horrific. They will all be horrific on a personal level in people&#x27;s lives. A large number of people.<p>There are 700 million people on this planet who do not have access to safe drinking water. One would think all of them would happily relocate to any wealthy country where their children have a better chance of a reasonable future. The number who would want to relocate to the UK is probably considerably north of that number as you don&#x27;t have to be on the lowest rung on the ladder of this planet to see the wealth of the UK and think that&#x27;s worth moving to. There are people with clean drinking water who are utterly desperate. Have any immigration policy at all - imagine your decree is law and implemented with resources and vigor. If the one decided on involves a scale of migration measured in hundreds of millions in a year societal collapse seems very likely. If one accepts that then one embraces the necessity of rejecting worthy people with heartbreaking stories. By the million.<p>Who to reject? How many to reject? There is no good answer in my opinion. What is your estimate of the number of people on the planet who will die if you reject them? Know they are being rejected. A tiny fraction of utterly desperate people on this planet will be accepted as immigrants in all the rich countries combined.<p>I say &#x2F;nothing&#x2F; about Afghanistan and refugees. I say literally nothing because I don&#x27;t know about it. I point out if the immigration policy arrived at is to take everyone from Afghanistan who wants to move and that policy works (hurrah!) and has manageable costs (again hurrah! and again I have no clue), it&#x27;s not the end of it. There are literally hundreds of millions more people in dire straits for whom moving their family to any rich country would save them. It&#x27;s f&amp;^king horrible. Every bit as horrible as scenes being televised. This is not an argument I&#x27;m making for rejecting any refugees from any country including Afghanistan. As soon as anyone with any kind of heart starts looking at a rich countries immigration policy and its results it is heartbreaking and horrible with no good answers, only ones you hate and loathe slightly less than others. Again this is not an excuse for being as evil as possible or eschewing all compassion or anything of the sort.<p>&quot;No more horrific than necessary&quot; is a reasonable goal because immigration policy, any policy, whatever it is, <i>will</i> be horrific. It sucks.

            &gt; There is no queue.<p>&gt; I mean that: there is no requirement for cases to be processed in any kind of order, if at all, and nor is there a quota (except in the minds of Home Office managers).<p>That&#x27;s an if-I-close-my-eyes-the-room-will-be-empty way of looking at it. There&#x27;s a backlog of cases waiting to be processed and a finite processing capacity, so adding more applications is necessarily going to, on average, delay existing (legitimate) applications.<p>&gt; Hardly anyone does this, or at least there&#x27;s no evidence of this. If you have money which you wish to trade for healthcare, there are usually better ways than bribing a firm to give you a fake job in the UK?<p>If there&#x27;s a loophole that lets someone get NHS healthcare for significantly less than the market price of equivalent healthcare, it seems absurd on its face to imagine that no-one in the world would want to exploit it. Most people are honourable, but there are enough desperate people, and frankly if were that easy then I wouldn&#x27;t blame them for taking advantage of the system.<p>&gt; See Afghanistan.<p>&gt; It was, allegedly, important enough to invade and spend billions on, as well as a number of Westerner lives<p>Pure whataboutism.

            &gt; 700m immigrating in a year will probably achieve collapse.<p>If they all go to the same destination, sure, but there’s no reason to even expect that collective behaviour and plenty of examples to doubt it (most people go short distances, e.g. 80% of the Syrian refugees went to the countries that share a land border with Syria).<p>Though I absolutely agree with the point that immigration is super-emotive even at the best of times, and likewise I don’t have a good answer to the troubles which cause a need for asylum (very separate in nature from other causes of migration but often blurred together politically) — best I’ve got is seeing that things are getting less bad, so more of what’s currently happening in aggregate is probably good even though we can clearly see specific examples of places and groups where that’s not good enough, like Afghanistan, Syria, Darfur, the Uyghurs, the Rohingya, and the Yazidi.

            No categorisation system is perfect, so there will always be cases that fall through the cracks, but most countries try to offer a spread of visas that cover most of the kinds of positive contributions to the country that they want to attract, without permitting too many who will be a drain instead. Work visas are by no means the only option, but if you&#x27;re arguing that you&#x27;re going to contribute positively to the economy then you need to be able to demonstrate that.

            It does seem more or less in line with the Brexit votes, but it&#x27;s worth remembering that the vote was pretty close and a large chunk of the country voted against Brexit. You&#x27;ll find a wide variety of attitudes to immigration within the UK.

            It hast nothing to do with Brexit, I suggest this is actually a kind of political bigotry.<p>Here&#x27;s data showing national attitudes towards migrants [1], the UK has consistently one of, if not the most positive view in Europe towards migrants. It&#x27;s always been a fairly pluralistic place relative to most places on the continent. The notion of reducing migration or having some control over it is fundamentally different that views of migrants themselves, much like there&#x27;s a big distinction between regular migrants and undocumented migrants, which is sometimes conveniently ignored for political reasons.<p>The rules for migrants are varied in every country, they are similar on the Continent in many ways where they have their own bits of weirdness.<p>The Falkland Islands have a population of 3000, which is really, really small. Every &#x27;small nation&#x27; especially the really tiny one&#x27;s are going to have a really peculiar take on basically everything.

            My American in laws did expat life in UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, others in the region. They, and many other western expats, employed Filipino house keepers. They have to assume a lot of responsibility for their actions while in the country as well. The expats are there under-highly conditional work visas and employeeing low-wage expats to come into the country was like another level of liability they took on personally and could blow up their work visa status if something really went wrong. It was normal for the expats to take their worker&#x27;s passport and the Filipino&#x27;s were basically trapped, and they wouldn&#x27;t always have a car or any mode of transportation. I recall their biggest fear was if she got pregnant while in their &quot;care&quot; it was almost like the child was their responsibility or if she had some relationship with a married guy it would be a big issue (paraphrased hearsay...). It sounded horrible, but in reality it mostly worked since the western expats were not exploitative but the opportunity is more than present.  My understanding is the natives imported labor in a highly exploitive way (low wage labor camps, etc).

            All of that region is a horror show in terms of exploitation. My opinion is contributing to their economies is effectively endorsing their policies. If you have an issue with the ethics of these countries and their exploitation of vulnerable labour, don&#x27;t work there.

            &gt; Just because someone isn’t constantly and overtly cruel to their “imported labor” does not mean they aren’t exploitative.<p>While true. What’s also interesting is “exploitative” is often through the modern western lens. It’s also a sliding scale where it is quite often seen as a good deal from labor’s perspective. In my previous example, the Filipino’s generally loved the arrangement. They got to travel and send a good deal of money home. It was a highly sought after position from their perspective. My experience is limited to about 10 days in the region and what I heard from American expats, but the hard labor forces also generally liked the arrangement. It offered opportunities that did not exist wherever they immigrated from. It was not without risks as no&#x2F;low worker safety or OSHA concepts are in effect. Also just what we would consider fair labor practices, just didn’t exist. I’m sure slavery does exist as well because the opportunity is very present.

            I am British and I moved to an EU country when Britain was still in the EU.<p>I was surprised because unless I went to the immigration office to prove to them that I either had &#x27;enough&#x27; (never really defined) money to support myself, or had a permanent employment contract - I would not have any state coverage for anything (health etc). The UK would of course not support my health care in a different country on a permanent basis. This was within the EU, so free movement and that - so I was indeed surprised, that other countries did something similar within the EU.

            What country is this? In Portugal you only need a declaration under penalty of perjury that 1) you are employed or self-employed (no need of a permanent contract), 2) that you have enough money to support yourself and your dependents and that you have health insurance, provided such requirement applies to Portuguese citizens in your country of origin (leaving asides the students here). In particular the national law that transposes directive 2004&#x2F;38&#x2F;EC (Lei n.º 37&#x2F;2006) says in article 9, n. 4:<p>&gt; [...] Without prejudice to the dispositions in chapter VII, Union citizens or their family shall never be removed in the following circumstances:<p>&gt; a) [...]<p>&gt; b) When the Union citizens entered Portugal to seek employment and they prove that they continue to keep seeking employment.<p>Chapter VII only says people who joined to country to look for employment are not entitled to social security even after 3 months (which applies across the board).<p>And when I registered in the Netherlands I don&#x27;t remember having to provide proof of employment too, though they might have had that information on file. In any case, it was not a permanent contract.

            I felt like the detail that mattered there was that it is <i>the only way to get through the British military air base at Mount Pleasant (the only access to the islands)</i>.<p>If you don&#x27;t have to pass through a military base to get somewhere, there is a bit of wiggle room. You are supposed to do X, Y or Z but there end up being some exceptions.<p>In this case, the military base has a stranglehold on entry so you aren&#x27;t likely to see folks bending the rules a tad.

            It&#x27;s not unique to the US at all. Almost all the countries in North and South America are like this. If you want to claim it&#x27;s <i>wrong</i> that&#x27;s another debate but everyone in the Americas came from somewhere else, borders are an ephemeral concept and what&#x27;s bizarre to me is how strict Europe is with jus sanguinis when its borders have changed so many times in the last century and in the centuries leading up to it. I do believe in border controls and vetting immigrants in the sense of &quot;how many people can fit on this life raft without sinking it, what is the max take-off weight of this airplane&quot; but really everyone I know, even on the right, at some level feel there&#x27;s an inherent unfairness to where you happen to spawn in this life.<p>Speaking of bizarre, why are there zero barriers for a Finnish person to move to Portugal, but major barriers for a Brazilian, culturally more proximate due Portuguese colonialism to do the same? Why are there zero barriers for a Greek or Estonian to live and work in Spain but tough immigration rules for the spawn of their 15+ latin american colonies, who speak the same language and have the same religion?

            Modern states are to a large part insurance providers. Citizens pay premiums and get health care, pensions, disability care etc.<p>Insurance works when a large group of people pay premiums to protect against some condition that has not happened yet. If you could sign up for a fire insurance once your house is burning, the system would collapse.<p>For similar reasons, modern states need to keep poor people out since, on average, they will be a large net burden on their welfare systems.

            I think what curbs the immigration to Spain is its economic situation(15% unemployment rate), plus I wouldn&#x27;t say that Spain has tough immigration rules.
In 2020 11% of of people living in Spain were foreign nationals: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ine.es&#x2F;prensa&#x2F;cp_e2020_p.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ine.es&#x2F;prensa&#x2F;cp_e2020_p.pdf</a><p>Out of these 11% only a third were from EU (including Great Britain), 6.5% of the foreign nationals were from Latin America, taking 5 out of the 15 countries from which most Immigrants come from, and the biggest year to year increase in immigration is from Venezuela (39.8%), Colombia (31.3%) and Honduras (29.4%).

            According to that Wikipedia link (and my own NZ knowledge) that is quite incorrect on NZ being either the only other country or even as liberal. Essentially the same as Australia and less permissive than dozens of other major, larger nations.

            Not quite.<p>Children born in France only get French citizenship from birth if at least one parent either is a French citizen or was born in France. Otherwise, there are various processes for them to acquire citizenship later in life if they spend enough of their childhood in France.<p>In contrast, almost any child born in the US, regardless of the nationality or immigration status of the parents, is a citizen automatically from birth. The only exceptions are children of foreign diplomats and (hypothetically) children of members of an invading army. Even if the parents are visiting as tourists and the child leaves two weeks after birth and never returns, it&#x27;s still a citizen.<p>British law is somewhere in between the two- a child born in the UK is a citizen if at least one parent has &quot;settled status&quot; (in other words is a citizen, permanent resident, or otherwise has an unrestricted right to live in the UK).

            That isn&#x27;t distinctly different from marriage fraud, or whatever the US government calls it now. As a US citizen, you can basically jump start the immigration process by just having a recognized marriage to a foreigner. It&#x27;s pretty messed up in my opinion and encourages bad behavior on the part of both parties.

            What&#x27;s the alternative though? US citizens with non-American spouses would have to leave the US or live apart from their spouse. Assuming the spouse couldn&#x27;t independently qualify for permanent residence or a work visa.

            907 were killed, 1,188 Argentine and 777 British injured or wounded ... but if it wasn&#x27;t for the war, you could have seen the Parliament. Such misfortune.

            In real life, would you also respond to a trivial personal anecdote with moral chastising?
Does the discussion have to take a form of geopolitical virtue signalling anytimes it grazes a big &#x27;bad&#x27; event like a war? 
Is it ok to talk about mundane things, even in the shadow of the colossal international storms that surround us, without having to make a performance of fighting their shadows at all times?

            It&#x27;s clear that you have good reason to feel the way you do, but I&#x27;m sure you wouldn&#x27;t jump straight to attacking another person in real life, just because they come from a different background and don&#x27;t know anything about your experience.<p>You&#x27;d probably explain that the war looked very different from the other side, and give them information that helped them understand your point of view. You wouldn&#x27;t overinterpret someone&#x27;s simple comment about a trip they&#x27;d made as if it were some sort of political provocation. AlbertCory wasn&#x27;t comparing his vacation anecdote with war deaths in any way.<p>If you had included the context you gave here (&quot;if you were from Argentina you would know that war is still an open wound, that it happened during a de-facto government and that it was one of many atrocities that happened during that period&quot;) in your original reply, that already would have been enough to bridge the gap and create understanding. I think everyone here would benefit from learning more about the Argentinian experience.

            As another Croatian, I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I&#x27;d like other people to experience the breathtaking beauty of my country. On the other hand, considering all the negative externalities and the rampant devastation that comes with our brand of tourism I&#x27;m not sure I want any more tourists coming. I especially don&#x27;t want tourists buying holiday homes here.

            Too late - I grew up going to stay with my grandparents at Pag a lot during 90s (during the war and after) - I remember the streets were so empty we would play football. Forward to early 2000s and I remember car jams 4km long for some random low-key event in a fishing village (ribarske večeri). These days it&#x27;s not worth going to any tourist areas during season anymore, everything is overcrowded and the infrastructure isn&#x27;t built to support that much people (roads, parking, water supply&#x2F;sewage treatment, restaurants).<p>Late spring and early autumn are still gorgeous.<p>If you rent a boat it can be a bit better, but even then it&#x27;s a hassle with marinas, etc. Just avoid the peak months IMO.

            There are still places on the Croatian Adriatic which aren’t over run with tourists. Of course the popular areas are extremely crowded. There are still other beautiful islands which are not so busy.<p>I’m writing this from a small 20 tent only campsite on a Croatian island. Access is only by ferry. Facilities are limited (no large supermarkets for example). It’s our third summer here and while there have been some changes, it is very slow.<p>Taking a boat out for a day or two also allows for exploration of other, more remote islands. Some bays still aren’t over crowded with boats anchoring for the day.<p>Also, later in August and early in the week are quieter times. Yesterday,  I was the only person swimming at a nice sandy beach at 14:00.

            It was turning into tourist trap 20 years ago, the last time I visited. I think places like Italy or Greece offer more for same money (or even less). For balkan experience, Montenegro is a fine less spoiled option (depends on location obviously).

            If it&#x27;s the cheap prices you&#x27;re after, Albania is the answer.

            Croatia is significantly cheaper than Italy or Greece. Every meal you eat will be under $10 USD, good seafood too. The booze is stupidly cheap, bottled beer is like half the price of bottled water iirc and everyone was drinking openly everywhere on the street at all hours. Accommodations at excellent hotels were cheap. Getting around the country was cheap (we took a bus and stopped along dozens of cities along the coast). The most expensive part is airfare, but after that, it&#x27;s cheaper than probably most of europe and certainly any city in the U.S. in terms of having a vacation. When I visited there were few Americans, but so so many Australians I couldn&#x27;t understand it. I guess they know about it there moreso than the US.

            I first discovered Croatia when it was called Yugoslavia. Yes, it&#x27;s an extremely beautiful country. But the area also has systemic problems that to me seems to be political in nature. Well, perhaps not all. Some of it is also simply economic. For good or bad, that leads to cheap prices on everything, which is the real reason so many people come, despite its charm. I&#x27;m sure that can be alleviated with with and good leadership, however. And where there&#x27;s income, it&#x27;s also worth investing in infrastructure.

            While I complain about overbearing tourist season, the reality is that if you avoid popular tourist places in July and August Croatia can be a pretty great place to live, especially for us software developers that can remote.<p>Working as a small business freelancer (&lt;1M Euro income&#x2F;year) gets you around 70% net income (this is with healthcare and minimal retirement plan payments and without accounting and doing stuff like justifying expenses etc. which drives that much further with VAT returns). Public healthcare is inconsistent at best, but there is a healthy industry of medical tourism built for western Europeans that&#x27;s easily affordable on a normal freelancer income. Likewise private childcare, schools, etc. all available and affordable. And all those beautiful places are still around and nice other 10 months a year. You can easily afford multiple properties and a comfortable lifestyle.<p>I spent a decent amount of time into looking for alternative places I could live in EU but really nothing looks that interesting, Spain looked attractive until I saw the taxes (and their public system is not worth that kind of money), western Europe is expensive and I would get very minimal increase in income by moving there (programming is not well paid) so I can realistically have a better standard of living here.

            My cousins who were college educated in Zagreb or Split are finding work in Germany. The brain drain is real. I can&#x27;t help but think that balkanization seriously killed the economy there and nipped in the bud any hope of strong private industries investing and establishing themselves in such a tiny place. More Croatians live in Germany than Croatia today, because Germany did the opposite and unified, and brought on economic stability it continues to enjoy, rather than fractured after the iron curtain fell.

            Balkanization had nothing to do with it - the problem was that communism valued loyalty over ability and promoted people according to that principle. After Yugoslavia fell apart, the new political parties, both ruling and opposition, simply changed colors while maintaining the same patterns of behavior.

            I don&#x27;t know, balkanization today is widely seen as a mistake that economically weakened the region. Consider how that would look for the U.S. California has the 5th largest GDP in the world if it were its own country. Louisiana on the other hand would quickly turn into a backwater, as it is a net recipient of federal support and California is a net provider. When you look at the states of the former Yugoslavia, you see the exact same effect, because these states drawn along old historical lines did not have equivalent economic outputs, and areas that generated more resources for the state subsidized other areas. Today, Slovenia is doing well, Bosnia is falling behind. They aren&#x27;t even all in the EU.

            I really love Croatia, it&#x27;s a beautiful country, but I don&#x27;t want to deal with the Croatian government.<p>If conditions were more fiscally favourable, if there were better private schools, an english speaking expat community, I&#x27;d definitely move there.<p>I think Montenegro is doing pretty good in that regard. Taxation is straightforward and reasonable. That attracted private capital. Good private schools started popping out, the Tivat marina was built. It&#x27;s also the first country to be in line to join the EU - which is not something I consider positive, but it&#x27;s certainly a sign of the quality of the country.<p>Sadly Croatia is still not there and, frankly, I doubt it&#x27;s going to get there anytime soon.
Croatia is like a poorer version of countries in the EU: high and complex taxes, which get converted into mediocre services after passing through an inefficient government. The only difference is that European countries are richer and therefore the services are marginally better, even if they&#x27;re getting worse and worse over time.<p>I understand my anarchist solution can be seen as radical and it&#x27;s not going to happen, but even moving in that direction would be helpful.

            In the 90s you went to a travel agent who arranged your airfare, lodging, even cab fare in between. You wouldn&#x27;t find like an airbnb setup so easily, but Croatia is absolutely full of hotels even to this day. Honestly even today its easier to just pay someone to do that for you than fuddle with half a dozen websites to do the same on your own time.

            I think you have a wrong impression - Croatia was a tourist destination during Yugoslavia. I think some places today still see less tourists then they did back then. Most of the coast has been living off tourism for at least half a century at this point. Also English level is pretty good among younger population, far better than say Spain or Italy.<p>While I complain about it being overcrowded during peak tourist season that&#x27;s just me reminiscing about the time that I grew up which was during and shortly after the civil war (naturally not a lot of tourism back then and it took years to recover). Any popular tourist place in Europe I&#x27;ve been to has been similar, eg. Dubrovnik is super popular and overcrowded - but so is Venice for example (if not worse).

            If your occupied territory is far from the main seat of your remnant empire, you MUST send in as many troops as possible in the short term and then as many immigrants as possible in the long term, to consolidate your overseas hold by means of demographic claim.<p>There is no great mystery here. What is interesting is how this behaviour from the Western nations is tacitly ignored but somehow China asserting its claim over HK or Taiwan becomes a matter for international outrage. The outrage would be more real if Britain handed over Falkland to Argentina and then they would have better moral authority to ask China to desist from expansionism.

            Never mind already back in the 80s and 90s the British population of the Falklands preferred to remain a part of the UK. Nevermind Argentina invaded the Falklands and was ultimately repulsed. No idea where the idea that the Falklands belong to Argentina comes from. The only meaningful population of the islands ever was and is British. Which makes the comparison to HK and Taiwan somewhat pointless, nevermind that Taiwan is a suvereign nation and that the UK handed HK back to China.

            And screw the people who actually live there, right?<p>A better way to think about this is to consider the case of Saint Pierre et Miquelon, which are two islands off the coast of Canada -- literally 19 km away, and so much closer than the Falklands are to Argentina. They are French territory, inhabited by French citizens. And (aside from occasional disagreements about who gets to explore for undersea resources in the vicinity of the islands) Canada really doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with this, because (in this area, at least) Canada is a more mature nation than Argentina.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Saint_Pierre_and_Miquelon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Saint_Pierre_and_Miquelon</a>

            Artifacts of the era, sure, but I think that&#x27;s a very incomplete take.<p>IMO they&#x27;re closer to the people of St. Pierre and Miquelon than they are to Shanghai. [1] The people of Hong Kong were British Citizens until 1997, and the citizens of Macau, Portuguese citizens until 1999 (it&#x27;s a little more complicated there, it&#x27;s ~1981-1999, depending). Just as the Miquelonians are French citizens - not British, not Canadian and not American.<p>A tiny island, in North America, that retains its allegiance to France and uses the Euro.

            As colonial power, they can issue passports for oversea citizens, it does not mean anything. When returning to China, citizens are given a choice to take whichever passport they choose. To fix a colonial problem, you need to have the power to confront them, British left Hong Kong, and Portuguese left Macau not because those details, because they couldn&#x27;t hold on to it<p>As in Sri Lanka or Bangladesh, British still owns properties legally from colonial age, and they are able to extract wealth legally.

            For clarity (1) &quot;As colonial power, they can issue passports for oversea citizens, it does not mean anything.&quot; -- French folks living in any Overseas Territories are French-French, EU citizens free to live anywhere in the EU or Metropolitan France. This is not true of for instance folks born in British Overseas Territories. So YMMV. Depends on the nation. Your take is more a reflection of UK policy than colonial policy.<p>(2) &quot;When returning to China, citizens are given a choice to take whichever passport they choose.&quot; - Unfortunately they were not. You could register as a BN(O), a British National (Overseas) which conveyed no right of abode anywhere on Earth - not in the UK, not in the EU - but when combined with an HKID offered you one complete &#x27;passport.&#x27; Valid for permanent residency in Hong Kong plus consular protection of the British when traveling abroad that the PRC has chosen not to respect. Or you could be a Hong Kong (SAR) Citizen if the PRC would take you, which <i>roughly</i> required you to be ethnically Chinese. BN(O) registration has been closed for years I believe.<p>I think Macau followed a similar model, with SAR passports, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure.<p>(3) &quot;To fix a colonial problem, you need to have the power to confront them, British left Hong Kong, and Portuguese left Macau not because those details, because they couldn&#x27;t hold on to it.&quot; - Do you think the French could defend St Pierre and Miequelon? From America? I agree that Portugal could not defend Macau and the UK could not defend Hong Kong but that’s not really all there is to it - see Taiwan.

            Declaring after the war that the secession had never happened and was impossible was an evil move in my book. (Though whether there was any desired to maintain the Confederacy without slavery I don&#x27;t know).<p>Going to war with the seceding states over their endemic human rights abuses is more arguable. Personally I despise the holier-than-thou attitude of so many northern states, who had tolerated those same human rights abuses for centuries and then suddenly decided that they were utterly unconscionable, coincidentally just after the northern economy became able to manage without them. But maybe that&#x27;s ultimately how moral progress gets made.

            In PRC&#x27;s opinion, it is not colonial replay. Taiwan was returned to the China after WW2 officially, and the government that time was ROC, Republic of China, and there is no official end of the Chinese civil war, no peace agreement signed. Taiwan&#x27;s independence party want to make Taiwan to be the front of containing China, which can only make the situation worse.<p>I don&#x27;t like to predict, but I have to say a war will happen. Ever since PRC was founded, unifying China is part of its mission. There was a hope for a peaceful unification of some sort, it is long gone now. It is the reality now.

            The &quot;kidnapping&quot; in your example happened in 1949.  It&#x27;s no longer about the hypothetical daughter, but more likely her grandchildren.  Given the passage of time it&#x27;s farcical to insist on reversing this.

            Your analogy is insipid. If kidnapping is not right, the people who sold their children to kidnappers should never again get custody of their children, especially if the children are begging not to go back. How ridiculous to claim something belongs in the colonial age while defending the nations that continue the practice today, namely China. China defenders are the lowest of the low, the political equivalent of the pedophile defenders.

            I don&#x27;t think describing Britain as expansionist is accurate, in fact the remaining overseas territories were often considered a liability for the government rather than an asset. The reason Argentina invaded to begin with is because the military presence in the region had been heavily cut back and they expected Britain to settle the matter diplomatically. Nobody (including the US) believed that Britain would be successful in repelling the invaders with military force. There had even been suggestions before the war that the islands be sold to Argentina over the heads of the islanders, who didn&#x27;t and still don&#x27;t want to become Argentinian. You have to remember that was the moribund Britain of the early 1980s rather than the ascendent Britain of the 1880s, there was far more concern over the disasterous economic situation at home than holding onto a relatively unimportant bit of land in the South Atlantic.<p>Invading was a footgun of international proportions, once Argentina forcefully occupied British territory any hope of a diplomatic solution (which may well have happened) went directly down the toilet because it turned the Falklands from an inconvenience to Britain into a military matter no country could simply shy away from without an enormous loss of prestige. Nobody loses prestige by selling some neglected islands to another country, but having them forcefully taken in a war of aggression is another matter entirely and could have invited no other reponse. It also turned a place that was more or less ignored by Westminster into a place that would be very, very difficult to invade again because of the increased military presence in the region.<p>Nobody who&#x27;s remotely literate denies the British Empire did many terrible things in its history, but in this specific case for once it actually wasn&#x27;t in the wrong. The Falklands never had a native population to oppress or enslave, they simply had a small series of competing European colonists who in my 21st century eyes never seemed that committed to the place to begin with. I realise there&#x27;s a lot of arguments around whose claim from the 19th century is most legitimate, but the fact of the matter is that the people who actually live there now have zero interest in becoming Argentinian and unlike the imperial powers of yore we actually tend to believe in self-determination these days.

            Well, the French settled forst and handed over the islands to the Spanish in 1776 based on the Spanish&#x2F;Portuguese colonial agreement from the 15th century. For most of the time since the 19th the islands were under British control.<p>That would be like basing territorial claims everywhere based on borders from 200 years ago. Or worse, picking the borders from a period that suits best. And we are talking about the Spanish Empire here, not modern day independent Argentina.

            I don’t think these two things are the same. Taiwan or HK are&#x2F;were large scale democratic societies, economic hubs, cultural centers etc. The Falklands are a couple of strategically located islands in the middle of nowhere.

            I think a closer analog to the Falklands is the European colonial powers and much of the Caribbean. The French and St. Martin&#x2F;St. Barts, the Dutch and Sint Maarten&#x2F;Aruba&#x2F;Bonaire&#x2F;Curacao - and of course the British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, Bermuda, the BVI, Montserrat and Turks and Caicos. The latter has interestingly tried to join Canada a few times. Not really located anywhere strategic.

            I agree in principle, though some of these islands want to stay with France &#x2F; the EU, in contrary to the Falklands it is the native people there that want to stay, not the (only) the colonialists.

            Sounds a bit like Wallis and Futuna - the French have been open to, or even supportive of decolonization for decades now, but the Wallisians have no interest in leaving France [1] - perhaps they learned from the divergent stories of La Reunion and Mayotte as compared to the Comoro Islands? I believe La Reunion has the highest GDP per capita in all of Africa (confirmed, 27000USD, which is way, way higher than the nearest continental neighbor). The EU even paid to put up a giant ring highway around the island. [2] No such luck for residents of Grande Comore, who are among the poorest on the continent - $1400USD - among the poorest on earth.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, such far-flung territories with limited resources, limited space and limited connections seem to be positioned to benefit the most from the largesse of a parent nation. Especially with European powers eager to distance themselves from their colonial past and ready to give their dependent territories maximum latitutde.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theculturetrip.com&#x2F;pacific&#x2F;wallis-futuna&#x2F;articles&#x2F;french-or-polynesian-the-curious-case-of-wallis-and-futuna&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theculturetrip.com&#x2F;pacific&#x2F;wallis-futuna&#x2F;articles&#x2F;fr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vinci-construction-projets.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;realisations&#x2F;new-coastal-road&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vinci-construction-projets.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;realisations&#x2F;n...</a>

            They were unsettled for a quite a while in between. There never was a true native population like native Americans or the various African peoples. The Falklands are a bunch of rocks being settled by various European powers and claimed by as many, they are since the 19th century a British territory aimed by Argentina. In a sense the British there are natives.

            Giving up Hong Kong isn&#x27;t necessarily the &quot;right thing&quot; - Hong Kong Island was ceded to the UK in perpetuity ages ago, in the 1840s. Kowloon and the New Territories were on a 99 year lease expiring in 1997. The UK giving up Hong Kong Island is as &quot;right&quot; as America ceding California to the Spaniards in the late 1990s IMO. Both defeats occurred around the same time. The people of Hong Kong were as much Chinese IMO as the Californians are Spanish.<p>The really interesting one is Macau, which was Portuguese for almost 450 years - from 1557, but was ceded to China in 1999. So, for long before the United States even existed. It&#x27;s a lot like ceding Roanoke colony to the UK in 1999. But worse, since they don&#x27;t even speak the same language (Cantonese&#x2F;Traditional and Portuguese vs. Mandarin).<p>[edit] But yes, the next wrong was that the CCP broke their agreement regarding the autonomy of their Special Administrative Regions and the effective dissolution of the &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot; model.

            I don&#x27;t think that would be much different than the UK invading say Gibraltar in 1704. I&#x27;m not going to <i>advocate</i> for it but if they did it, and held their possession for a few hundred years (content with what the capture did for their political posture) then yes, we&#x27;d be having a different conversation. Possession is 9&#x2F;10ths of geopolitics. A few hundred years from now, the population of Taiwan would likely have a very different opinion of the matter.<p>At that point I suspect there&#x27;d be quite a lot of resistance to breaking them away from the mainland too.

            The UK was actually considering giving the Falklands to Argentina before the war. The invasion ruined whatever goodwill was there, justified the costs of maintenance, further legitimized those opposing a potential handover and rationalized further security spending.<p>If there&#x27;s a common thread here, it might be the use of an external crisis by the Argentine gov to deflect from domestic problems. Of course that depends on your perception of the CCP. Some regard the CCP&#x27;s governance as non-problematic and wouldn&#x27;t agree.<p>The whole thing seems off-topic.
