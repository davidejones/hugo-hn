            Buddhist and other thoughtful practitioners of mindfulness meditation are well aware of this phenomenon — which is why mindfulness meditation is usually paired with mettā (&quot;loving-kindness&quot;) meditation as students progress.<p>(The article mentions mettā practice towards the end, but doesn&#x27;t explicitly acknowledge that the need for this balance has been widely recognized).<p>As TFA says, this is much more of a problem of McMindfulness than of more traditional contemplative practices

            I’m interested in the thesis, because a lot of Buddhist intro texts I’ve got into warn about going down the rabbit hole alone and without instruction. Meditation practice (or certain plant medicines) can put you in a state of feeling you are one with god, but this can manifest as “I’m the one who is god” otherwise known as a psychotic break (mentioned in Ram Dass’s Be Here Now)[0]<p>But this study is something Paula Poundstone would have a field day with. Here’s my interpretation: students who were given the breath-focus-training felt like they got something done for the day and students who weren’t given anything to do didn’t want the day to go to waste so they figured why not, I’ll stuff some ads in envelopes.<p>Are these studies even meant to be published and taken seriously by the press? Sometimes I think these weak studies are just student projects going through the motions of how you <i>might</i> design an experiment.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikischool.org&#x2F;_media&#x2F;be_here_now.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikischool.org&#x2F;_media&#x2F;be_here_now.pdf</a><p>Edit: page 196 of the pdf, page 97 of the book is the dazzling art of the realized being dashing past the pews of a church shouting “listen to those words you’re singing!

            Buddhist societies are not exceptionally <i>just</i>, despite thousands of years of attempting to achieve balance, and not least because there&#x27;s a hierarchy that naturally develops among practitioners, and many injustices in daily life are written off as a result of dharma. Buddhism just abstracts reality into something slightly more palatable that doesn&#x27;t require as much action on your part. Tip that into westernized self-help &#x27;mindfulness&#x27; and you have a perfect antidote to the nagging guilt of self-reflection and responsibility for the state of affairs in the world.

            &gt; are written off as a result of dharma<p>Dhamma is generally understood as <i>teaching</i> or <i>nature</i>. <i>Kamma</i>, (often mixed up with <i>karma</i>, a Hindu notion that is close in some aspects, but really not the same) is, in simple terms, <i>cause and effect with respect to an individual</i>. All injustices are a result of cause and effect (at least, I hope you think so) but where I will agree is that it shouldn&#x27;t be the basis for doing nothing - unless doing nothing is the best choice, and knowing that is the trick, isn&#x27;t it, Buddhist insight or not.<p>&gt; Buddhism just abstracts reality into something slightly more palatable that doesn&#x27;t require as much action on your part.<p>I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s a good summation of what Buddhism is or does, it might be best to get the basics right (the terms above are a good indication) and then move on to telling others what you think a system is for, or its impact on society… I don&#x27;t remember Buddha promising a societal utopia but perhaps my memory is deceiving me.

            Minor nitpick - kamma and karma are the same thing, but different languages. Kamma is Pali and karma is Sanskrit.<p>To be even more detailed, karma is the action rather than the effect, which is called karma vipaka. The English word karma means something more fluid - depending on context.

            Thanks, I do know but in general English speakers use the word karma and then ascribe the Hindu reading to Buddhism, so I was answering that.<p>As to the cause and effect part, again, I wasn&#x27;t about to start on a &quot;there are no causes and no effects, only conditions…&quot; path as it would only muddy the water for the person I&#x27;m responding to, but I don&#x27;t mind the nitpicking, it&#x27;s a good point and glad to see reasonable challenges in the comments.<p>Edit, I didn&#x27;t mean to put this all on the English!

            Karma is a hell of a justification ;)<p>My impression is that Buddhism, like all faiths, has that surface level of justifying why there is evil and how to get free of it - so there’s that inner peace [0] - but there’s also this call to action, to reduce suffering, to work on peace outside yourself - that’s compassion, and Jesus and Buddha were all about it, even if their followers sometimes lose the plot. (I’m too ignorant to speak of Muhammad).<p>As far as the corruption of religion into preserving social hierarchies goes, I like to think that the capacity to be co-opted by a state is a feature, not a bug: a viral transmission vector. These holy texts might not have survived without a corrupt state maintaining it.<p>[0] Nellie McKay has a song by this name on her album “get away from me”, it’s a fantastic critique of this focus on “inner peace”

            I&#x27;m highly skeptical of people who claim to have found salvation in Jesus, and righted all their former wrongs. I never know if they&#x27;re telling themselves that, or just trying to convince me it&#x27;s true. But I&#x27;ve lived in Buddhist countries and watched the same pattern of individual behavior juxtaposed with belief. And you&#x27;re right, they both rendered unto Caesar and probably survived and propagated as a result. And to be clear, neither one is malicious or bad in its basic construction - telling people to be mindful or live according to ethical ideas.
What does suck though is that both of them try to pretend that ethics spring from their written dogma, rather than teach people that ethical behavior is a rational and completely natural response. And by making it part of dogma they rob people of credit for having ethical impulses. So you want to help the poor - you&#x27;re being &quot;Christian&quot; as opposed to being a rebel, or a good person. They deprive the individual of authentic agency in this regard. And an individual deprived of that agency passes down the dogma; and after generations it loses meaning.

            Buddhism, like any philosophy, is meant to be studied. I wouldn&#x27;t assign to it what belongs to <i>(mis)interpretation</i> of its teachings. Even within Buddhist societies it&#x27;s understood differently by different people, with many (most?) choosing not to practice any form of mindfulness, but rather preferring to worship. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the superstition is discouraged, it&#x27;s more easily accessible: status and amulets, offerings, people receiving blessings while on a submissive posture, women not allowed in certain areas, etc. And probably due to its nature, the philosophy meets the practitioner where the latter feels comfortable.

            lol it’s a miracle that he held it together long enough to put it in English, I’ve met a few acid heads that have seen the other side and lost touch with what other people will understand. Ram Dass I guess was wise to give so many lectures, that’s a lot of good feedback for whether your ideas are gobbledegook<p>Another prophet that I think is talented at articulating truth is Duncan Trussel - the boy has been to hell and heaven and back again and just loves talking about it. His show on Netflix is called “midnight gospel”, I think any ram dass fan would enjoy it and the psychedelic&#x2F;religious art style

            Whenever I&#x27;ve looked to Buddhist sources for meditation instruction, they&#x27;ve usually stressed the importance of &quot;metta&quot; or &quot;loving-kindness&quot; meditation. This practice involves generating empathy towards yourself, those close to you, neutral people, and enemies or &quot;difficult&quot; people.<p>This seems designed exactly to counteract the self-focus tendency the article mentions.

            It&#x27;s a question of resource-management. Mindfulness is selfish like a rate-limited API is inaccessible. Opening the floodgates and crashing and burning helps nobody. Put on your own oxygen mask before helping your neighbor with theirs, etc.

            Interdependance on a whole societal level is an illusion. The mechanism at work is peer pressure.

            Towards yourself. We live on a society.

This can be hard. But it is something that can be done alone, if one is afraid of being exploited (which depending on your environment can be a totally realistic fear).

            Calling Interdependence peer pressure is diluting the nuance of people&#x27;s relationships. It has a lot to do with culture and societal norms, for example in my culture (Arab) there is a strong emphasis on family and community values, i&#x27;m expected to take care of my parents, even going so far as to ensure their financial stability during retirement (absolutely NO care homes!). It&#x27;s an interesting insight into conformity, but it&#x27;s clear to researchers that western countries have less conformity, and therefore more selfishness by default; it&#x27;s a symptom of the capitalist mindset.
Regarding charity, yes western countries are more charitable but isn&#x27;t this just more conformity? Charity is always given the most when others are watching, when it&#x27;s made into a game or a challenge (remember ALS ice bucket?). Using charity as a metric for interdependence is also an illusion. More charity does not necessarily mean more interdependence; we should be measuring (as best as we can) happiness and satisfaction in daily life, which coincidentally the US and the UK fall short compared to other nations.<p>Maybe what we can learn from this is that there isn&#x27;t a be all end all singular mindset, and we can adapt our thinking to fit our cultural norms, whilst avoiding the pitfall of self indulgence.

            Coming from Judaism - our history was based on family and community as well. It&#x27;s only recently in the US that the personal impulse has become more important than taking care of your family. The word for charity (tzadaka in Hebrew, I think the Arabic world is very similar), you <i>know</i> is not and should never be about showing pride or wealth. This is what our Christian friends actually wrote down in their bible... their prophet was some rabbi who pointed out that many other rabbis strut around pretending to look charitable, who are in fact selfish. Then they nailed him to a cross for saying that. This behaviour has not changed much in the last 2000 years, whether you&#x27;re Muslim, Jewish or Christian.

            &gt; Calling Interdependence peer pressure is diluting the nuance of people&#x27;s relationships.<p>True, it cannot always be reduced to that, especially within families.<p>It might often seem detached and of course elders always want to be visited more, but many also prefer that they can live in a special care.<p>The realities of modern work and family structures in western nations doesn&#x27;t leave much room for care in many cases and it gives elders as their children more freedom.<p>It is true about the signaling properties of charity, although that is much more common in high society groups where it is indeed an expectation or a reason to come together.

            There&#x27;s a difference between real charity and a charitable impulse. A charitable impulse is good and it&#x27;s what&#x27;s being measured here. Real charity as it exists in our world breeds horrible dependency issues and is responsible for keeping entire continents in a state of forced infancy.

            I think mindfulness is garbage, but equanimity is not an ethos or a framework. Empathy - the ability to momentarily put yourself in someone else&#x27;s shoes, and to think and dwell on that, is the basis for a social contract. Personal mindfulness is not and never has been the basis for anything other than self-aggrandizement.

            If you think mindfulness is garbage, I think you don&#x27;t know what it is. And I wouldn&#x27;t blame you for that, because I think I&#x27;ve only ever heard one monk give a good definition of it.<p>Mindfulness is this: remembering to watch the movement of mind&#x27;s attention. In other words, remembering to know which of the six kinds of knowing you are doing at any given moment.<p>Anyone who practices for a while can verify that it&#x27;s true -- attention really does flicker rapidly between six kinds of knowing.

            &quot;Equanimity&quot; is also a practice (it&#x27;s been mentioned up-comments). It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;calmness&quot; or &quot;imperturbability&quot;, in this context.<p>One form of the practice would be to consider those to whom you feel most warmly, and reflect that in previous lives they might have murdered you. And to consider those you hate, and reflect that in a future life, they might be your mother. This is supposed to reduce attachment and aversion.<p>(That formulation depends on the idea of rebirth, but I&#x27;m sure formulations exist that don&#x27;t depend on metaphysical speculations)<p>There is a whole bunch of practices that are supposed to work together with mindfulness. Getting the balance wrong can lead to depression, panic attacks and other disturbances.<p>&gt; Personal mindfulness is not and never has been the basis for anything other than self-aggrandizement.<p>Well, that&#x27;s an opinion, rather strongly expressed, but without evidence. I happen to disagree; like you, I decline to present evidence.

            &#x27;Mindfulness&#x27; is nothing <i>but</i> egotism. I don&#x27;t want to throw around things like <i>privilege</i> and <i>bored housewife</i>, but it&#x27;s just a self-help cult that taps into the same basic infrastructure as any other religion, then encourages people to feel proud of themselves for accessing relatively easy-to-access parts of their brains and gives itself credit for helping them overcome the psychological trauma and hurdles to getting there.<p>To me, the saddest thing about &quot;mindfulness&quot; is that it is to existentialism what the Taliban is to statues of Buddha. A very blunt tool for people without enough time or patience to examine reality or actually ask, &quot;why is this thing here? Might it mean something?&quot; This is pop-cultural garbage taken to cult level to overwhelm fragile peoples&#x27; minds, without giving them a chance to understand the historical context of their place and time or what reason they might actually have to be going through the things they&#x27;re going through.<p>So mindfulness leading to egoism is a foregone conclusion, because it&#x27;s a degenerated version of existential or Buddhist thought, intentionally turned into trifling horseshit for people who were born, live, and will die without any notion or care of anything that happened before them. And they were already egoists; and having a problem you can&#x27;t frame in broader terms than your own ability to pay attention to it for a few minutes is having a pretty pathetic problem indeed.

            &gt; Mindfulness&#x27; is nothing but egotism<p>Eh, I think this is reading too much into it. Mindfulness is merely a training in relaxing and finessing of our rigid egoic framing and thus be able to generate more insights. It is egocentric in the sense of being a training on the ego function but the telos is actually breaking out of default egocentricity.<p>It is the <i>culture of narcissism</i> that turns this into a tool of spiritual bypass and optimizing one’s own detached wellbeing. It uses mindfulness as an emotional regulation tool, not a frame expanding education in preparation to other practices.<p>Don’t get me wrong, everything you point out as missing is accurate, it is just it was never mindfulness’s burden to bear alone as it’s nothing but a single practice to be done in the context of Buddha, dharma and sangha.

            This is my favorite rant on HN yet<p>Buddhism was already distilled “Hinduism for Export”, it is foolish to distill it further. IMO the whole fad is a result of Americans mistaking Buddhism for religion, and not pre-western psychology, so in a bid to get the benefits without the baggage, and to be allowed to teach yoga in schools, mindfulness practitioners dropped the spiritual framework and just said “focus on your breath, it’s good for you”

            You said it better than I could have. I&#x27;m annoyed about the secondary effects of falsy beliefs, but I think you got more directly to the root of it. Lots of religions are more palatable upon export, is a good point. The Romans would have never picked up Christianity as a fashionable cult unless it had mostly dropped the whole monotheistic thing.

            One thing I like about cold-blooded Camus&#x2F;Sartrean existentialism is, we&#x27;re fucked up, broken creatures, so when we do occasionally get the best work out of ourselves, or even experience true empathy, it&#x27;s a miracle. When you say you feel it too often it stops being true. Extend that to a whole culture where you have to say it all the time, and everyone&#x27;s just a liar.

            &gt; &#x27;Mindfulness&#x27; is nothing but egotism.<p>I came to the same conclusion recently. I don&#x27;t practice meditation&#x2F;mindfulness as per definition, I just sit on my sofa and think about things like &quot;what is reality?&quot;, &quot;what is life?&quot;, &quot;why things simply are?&quot;... it&#x27;s all just mental masturbation for me, and at the end of the day I feel like I&#x27;m so intelligent that my neighbours watching Netflix or the news are just like stupid monkeys. I do know, though, that at the end of the day I&#x27;m just another stupid monkey and that &quot;thinking on higher things&quot; means absolutely nothing more than mental masturbation.
