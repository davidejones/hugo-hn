            I wonder if all the hoopla is because mastodon &#x2F; the fediverse are finally receiving some (deserved) traction? The accounts count does not seem to show a new regime (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-federation.info&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-federation.info&#x2F;</a>) but maybe there are more reliable indicators?<p>In any case, sorting out conflicts of interest, business models, competing visions etc about the fediverse is a task that is still almost 100% for the future, as being niche and unknown does not put much pressure.<p>The issue of a &quot;local or global timeline&quot; is imho but the thin edge of a wedge: the current open source fediverse projects largely emulate the surveillance platforms (indiscriminately copying the good and the bad). That is extremely limiting and ultimately self-defeating. The open source fediverse can, must (and most likely in due course will) redefine the meaning of social platforms so as to undo the damage done by the first generations. Godspeed

            Isn&#x27;t (one of) the point of federation to limit the scope of surveillance? e.g. My host knows everything about me, but hosts it peers with only know that I&#x27;m indigochill@myhost, essentially the same as email.

            there are so many configurations with different &quot;information leakage&quot; profiles &#x2F; preferences: from self-hosting to mass instances, from pseudonymous accounts to verified &#x2F; public identities etc. One of the strong points of the fediverse would be to enable and organize that multitude of options under uniform protocols that do not force anybody to particular architectures...

            You&#x27;ll also find that users of the instance don&#x27;t all run entirely free software and yet it&#x27;s still a relevant place to congregate and discuss topics like &quot;why this open source project didn&#x27;t work for me&quot;, &quot;why this open source project was a great alternative to closed-source offerings&quot; and all of the subtleties in-between.

            You&#x27;ll find that most community members (including the staff) come from a wide&#x2F;diverse background. Unlike some other groups that have more of a &quot;FOSS or else&quot; atmosphere, Fosstodon has members (and staff)  that are hobbyists to extremists to pragmatics and everything in between.

            That&#x27;s pretty cool (and also pretty ridiculous that it took 8 months). I&#x27;m kinda confused by the last part:<p>&gt; Since both Patreon and our custom sponsorship platform are based around rewards to patrons&#x2F;sponsors, they cannot be classified as donations, so there are no changes to how those are taxed.<p>So when German non-profits want to hand out merch in exchange for a specific donation amount, non-profit has to pay for-profit taxes on that?

            That would be my default assumption. Back when I was running a non-profit in Poland, this was the assumption we&#x27;ve made when evaluating options like Patreon - that we&#x27;ll account for it as income (I don&#x27;t know the actual interpretation because I&#x27;ve stepped down before the foundation started using such services).<p>On a related note - also in terms of Polish tax laws (which are bound to be more similar to German than e.g. US would be) - I recently talked about this with a tax advisor, in context of individuals funding OSS work via Patreon and other donation schemes; their answer was that it&#x27;s a bit case-by-case, depending on your reward structure. If the donors are getting direct value back for their donations, it&#x27;ll be seen as you selling those rewards (and&#x2F;or performing a service), which will obligate you to start an actual business. The safe way to do it is to not give anything in return, except maybe for a trinket that&#x27;s not commensurate to the value of donation.

            To qualify as a donation under German tax law, a donation needs to be voluntary (freiwillig) and altruistic (uneigennützig).[1] Where exactly the boundary between altruism and personal benefit lies would have to be judged by the courts in each individual case. For example, engraving the name of a donor on an altar, naming her in intercessions and inviting her to a dedication ceremony was interpreted as an &quot;outflow of charitable funds&quot; (Ausfluss der gemeinnützigen Mittelvergabe) and entitled to a tax deduction.[2]<p>[1] For more details see the following ruling of Germany&#x27;s Federal Fiscal Court: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bundesfinanzhof.de&#x2F;de&#x2F;entscheidung&#x2F;entscheidungen-online&#x2F;detail&#x2F;STRE201910047&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bundesfinanzhof.de&#x2F;de&#x2F;entscheidung&#x2F;entscheidunge...</a> (in German).<p>[2] Cf. this ruling of Germany&#x27;s Federal Fiscal Court: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bundesfinanzhof.de&#x2F;de&#x2F;entscheidung&#x2F;entscheidungen-online&#x2F;detail&#x2F;STRE201810106&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bundesfinanzhof.de&#x2F;de&#x2F;entscheidung&#x2F;entscheidunge...</a> (in German).

            &gt; So when German non-profits want to hand out merch in exchange for a specific donation amount, non-profit has to pay for-profit taxes on that?<p>I don&#x27;t know about german regulations specifically, but based on my experience in other legal systems and my understanding of the announcement, i believe it means that because &quot;patreon and our custom sponsorship platform&quot; aim to reward individuals, they cannot be considered donations for the non-profit.<p>A non-profit may employ&#x2F;contract people for specific tasks aligned with its goals, but rewarding people outside of such specific contract is closer to a &quot;shareholder&quot; model and incompatible with non-profit regulations. Of course, contributors to a non-profit may setup donation systems to pay their own bills, but that must not be advertised as donations &quot;to the non-profit&quot; (because that would be a lie), and they have to declare&#x2F;pay taxes on that.

            Yeah that&#x27;s what i assumed also, which is why i didn&#x27;t suggest that the maintainer is actually malevolent in my parent comment.<p>Also, to be fair, if the European Commission is funding a large-scale surveillance program for decentralized social media, i&#x27;m glad some of that money is actually going to free-software maintainers to improve the ecosystem, and not all of it into the wrong pockets (as is usually the case).

            Yes, i understand that&#x27;s a research project. I&#x27;m just skeptical of a publicly-funded software research project with millions of euros of funding (most researchers i know don&#x27;t have access budgets like that) and with seemingly some ties to the surveillance&#x2F;military apparatus.<p>Also i did some digging, and despite a paywall and some articles without links at all, their publications raise more questions than they answer about the actual trust&#x2F;governance model and privacy implications (see my other comments quoting some bits).<p>Moreover, the sentiment&#x2F;subjectivity analysis via ML leaves me dubious. I have a hard time believing AI can understand human discourse and&#x2F;or help solve human problems, see also James Mickens USENIX talk &quot;Why do keynote speakers keep suggesting we can improve security?&quot;<p>Finally, let me put on my paranoid hat: if i were to build a large-scale surveillance network to expose the social graph and flow of information (think XKEYSCORE) for decentralized social media, it would look a lot like EUNOMIA! On the contrary, if i were to build a reputation protocole for decentralized social media, it would be much simpler than the EUNOMIA project, and would probably be based on some kind of Web of Trust &#x2F; Fog of Trust (since it&#x27;s aimed at classifying&#x2F;auditing public data, where the social graph is already, at least partially, exposed).

            A wild guess would be that he is trying to remake a <i>centralised decentralised</i> Twitter.

            Mastodon is an ActivityPub implementation, right? So does that mean Mastodon can interact with other AP implementations? Or do they add some additional stuff that doesn’t interop?

            In practice the content that can be challenged under NetzDG is scoped and focused on hate speech and terrorism. While news outlets originally latched onto the &quot;they crush free speech&quot; soundbite, it&#x27;s really a law to acknowledge the responsibility of the publishing platform for what they&#x27;re bringing to the world.

            You are correct - as a person who cares deeply about free speech, I certainly place <i>less</i> value on basic decency.<p>To my mind, the correct response to violations of decency is giving people strong tools to screen and filter out content they don&#x27;t like. The <i>wrong</i> response is centralized enforcement. Inasmuch as centralized enforcement would be better at enforcing &quot;basic decency&quot;, I will confirm that I place its priority at a lower level than avoiding centralized enforcement.<p>I hold this view because in my opinion, I am far more likely to be harmed by attempts to enforce some unilateral definition of &quot;basic decency&quot; than the very indecency they aim to prevent. (I believe this is called the &quot;paradox of tolerance&quot;, though few know it in that formulation.)

            It does, for the most part! Defederation is the last resort, when you&#x27;ve got an instance that nobody wants to deal with (e.g. the people there are tracking down and harassing your users, and you want them to “win” and therefore stop). User-level moderation tools are much more common, though they&#x27;re currently a bit lacking.

            It is, actually. Once you restrict what others can say there&#x27;s no freedom of speech anymore. It&#x27;s like China saying you can&#x27;t talk about the regime - I&#x27;m sure they consider that &quot;basic human decency&quot; as well.

            &gt;Once you restrict what others can say there&#x27;s no freedom of speech anymore.<p>If you go by that definition then there is no country on Earth that has freedom of speech.<p>And that&#x27;s a good thing because that definition is completely and utterly <i>insane</i>; Absolute freedom of speech would be a catastrophe.

            Different poster, but I believe that freedom of speech not just does, but <i>must</i> come with freedom from consequences to be at all meaningful. Of course, there is nowhere that actually has that level of freedom of speech, but seen as a spectrum it makes sense.<p>Freedom of speech is freedom from consequences:<p>- of government reprisals<p>- of corporate reprisals<p>- of criminal reprisals<p>- of employment risks<p>- of relationship risks.<p>Pick and choose which matter to you. To me, freedom of speech applies to all, but other rights such as freedom of association sometimes override it. (And sometimes not.)

            The only speech that has no impact on that entire spectrum of human interaction is things never said.<p>I don&#x27;t think people generally want a lack of response to their speech (if they did, they&#x27;re saying nothing... Just making babbling noises best ignored). People want freedom from negative consequences. In short, people want to eat their cake and have their cake.<p>This is why every country ends up with laws that carve out some spectrum of consequences as inappropriate, but those laws are not all-encompassing... It is functionally impossible to eliminate all the consequences you&#x27;ve listed from the table while still giving listeners freedom to be their own independent agents and modify their behavior in reaction to speech. In particular, the last category you listed is a huge infringement on personal liberty of generally applied... I assume you don&#x27;t expect a person in a committed relationship, hearing their partner say &quot;I hate everything about my partner and I wish we&#x27;d never met,&quot; to not modify or end the relationship? Any legal infringement on their right to do so is an obvious curtailment of their rights.<p>In short, sometimes freedom of speech and freedom of association collide. One is a freedom of the speaker, the other freedom of the listener.

            I&#x27;m saying freedom of speech should not have unwanted consequences, and in that sense it cuts far beyond what anyone considers reasonable. However, that doesn&#x27;t make the definition <i>wrong</i>; it just means we better get comfortable with balancing conflicting interests.

            That&#x27;s nice to hear.  A lot of instance admins will defederate other instances based only on rumor or suspicion of wrongthink, preventing all of their users from following accounts on those instances even if they want to.  This has happened to my single user instance simply based on my political beliefs (primarily the right to free peaceful expression, you&#x27;d think that would be less controversial), not any content actually posted.<p>It&#x27;s a big problem in the fediverse, because one has to be a little bit of an activist in the first place to exit twitter, and these days popular activism and censorship overlap a lot.

            This is the way we defeat stalker capitalists who are trading trinkets to the natives for land. The core functionality of FaceCrook, Twatter and Instaglam doesn&#x27;t require $billions. The data we pay for these services is worth so much more that the exchange is essentially theft.<p>I have no use for a Twatter replacement, but when a non-profit (or benefit corporation) starts up a viable FaceCrook replacement, I will gladly donate.

            1. In a capitalist society, I should be able to name the price for something that belongs to me.<p>2. FaceCrook still has my data after they sell it.

            no but back to the economic argument the supply is so significant that no one person&#x27;s data is worth jack unless they&#x27;re a politician or something like that. Individually its basically worthless.

            Shouldn&#x27;t I be allowed to set the price for my data? Frankly, I don&#x27;t want to sell it at all, so these companies are essentially engaging in theft (ergo &quot;FaceCrook&quot;). Due to their network effect monopoly (and the blatant failings of our govt to effectively enforce anti-trust laws and to generally protect consumers from corporate abuse), I am forced to use their platform. Even if I didn&#x27;t, they would still be stealing my data.
