            I&#x27;m not a particularly pessimistic person in general, but I don&#x27;t know ...this tech, while cool, feels like the precursor to a worse future in general. Maybe I&#x27;ve seen too much sci-fi, but these robots look like optimizing for future soldiers, law enforcement etc. Given all the other Self-Driving &#x2F; Facial Recognition &#x2F; Loss of Privacy &#x2F; Deepfake &#x2F; &quot;AI is bad at recognizing $situation&quot;-type posts, and as all these techs converge I just feel melancholy, not optimistic. I feel like &quot;AI Robot cops show implicit bias resulting in 3 deaths&quot; or &quot;Robot Cop shoots innocent person after facial recognition goes bad&quot; or &quot;Crowd Control Bots kill 55 at peaceful protest&quot; - type headlines are the future here.

            Boston Dynamics was initially DARPA funded and intended for military uses, so you&#x27;re not wrong.<p>The weird thing is that the more I study history, the more I think that the real dystopia started a century (and perhaps a couple millenia) before I was born, and we&#x27;re just so adapted to it that we think it&#x27;s normal.  Take the &quot;[Ro]bot&quot; out of your headlines and those would be headlines from today, and if you ignore that the media never bothered to report on those a century ago, they&#x27;d be headlines from a hundred years ago.  We were depersonalized by the industrial revolution, and then large numbers of us were killed in the wars that followed.<p>In some ways, this gives me a weird sort of hope that our descendants will welcome their robot overlords.  In others, there&#x27;s a melancholy foreboding that our descendants will welcome their robot overlords.

These mercenaries fought at the whims of princes and kings who squabbled over whims and privilege, and the princes and generals are the only ones who are remembered.

            Sometimes we forget that the last 3-5 generations were the only humans in history for whom seeing a sibling die in childhood was not the norm. Instead of the industrial revolution dehumanizing us, for the first time ever we are raised from birth confident that we will live long and prosperous lives, that we need not kill nor fear being killed to live in this prosperity. Human life has become much more precious and cherished in modern times, not less. The middle of the 20th century was simply the last time that people who came of age before the massive improvement in living standards was in power in the western world.

            whats also easily forgotten is just how many people are alive right now.<p>the current estimate is that there have roughly been 105 billion birth since 50 000BC, with our current world population at almost 8 billion... about 8% of all humans that have ever lived are currently still alive.

            Your phrasing makes it sound as if most people alive have terrible living conditions and high early mortality... Which is incorrect.<p>The misery is pretty localized in Africa and some places in the middle east, which is less then 20% of the population.<p>Life could be better in a lot of places, but it&#x27;s incomparably better to life under the churches in the dark ages for example.

            Yuval is that you?<p>I have some sympathy for this view, but there&#x27;s also the fact that at this point we&#x27;ve basically solved hunger from a societal point of view.<p>Deprivation of calories from a population now happens because of war or intentional. At the current time we no longer are at the whim of natural causes of hunger.

            Well, it&#x27;s not quite the same as saying that the invention of agriculture made the current state of affairs <i>inevitable</i>. There&#x27;s a middle ground between historical determinism, and &quot;anything goes&quot; - some paths become more or less likely depending on how things go, but it&#x27;s never a railroad.<p>So, I would agree with OP in that it started with invention of agriculture, in a sense that that gave rise to rigidly hierarchical societies, and centralized states that could extract surplus from their citizens and spend it on warfare and other forms of oppression. But we didn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to take that route, and it doesn&#x27;t mean that agriculture per se is bad.

            But the reasonably reliable provision of calories via agriculture is what allows the size of stable societies to grow, and also what more closely tethers them to particular places.<p>As I^HYuval would say, those are the things that help start the long journey to the mess we&#x27;re today.

            Depends what you use as &quot;life metric&quot;... Is working 30 years in a tooth paste factory more fulfilling than living on the savanna and hunting then dying at the age of 36 from a broken leg?<p>I guess we will never know.
Yet we keep making things and automating.<p>Yes, we have solved hunger. Yes we have solved boredom. We only have to solve sexual needs. Then basically we have automated ourselves out of the &quot;human condition&quot;.... But why. What is the point?

            My favorite scifi series is the Polity Universe by Neal Asher.<p>The Polity are these benevolent AI that rule humanity after &quot;The Quiet War&quot;. It is called that because not a single shot is fired because they just take control of all hightech weapons and technology one day.<p>The books would be considered utopian scifi if the rest of the universe wasn&#x27;t so gritty. Which is why it is my favorite series.

            Aye which is why of the two I think the Polity would be the more likely outcome given human nature.<p>The Polity universe is technologically comparable to the Culture but in almost every other way darker, grittier and dirtier.<p>There are quite a few parallels between them though - enough that if you love one you&#x27;ll at least like the other.

            From Neal Asher&#x27;s Wikipedia page [0], you may consider starting with &quot;Gridlinked&quot; (2001).

            Imagine being able to remote control a semi-autonomous humanoid robot on the moon, or on mars, on in the asteroid belt, or in LEO, with the same dexterity and adaptability as humans, or even insects, but without needing air or water or sleep.

            Yes but police have organizations that manage them that are ran by people that can be influenced or jailed for doing the wrong thing. Owning a robot army is a totally different level of power over people. Robots do exactly what their owners tell them to do and don&#x27;t have a Union or any group to answer too.

            People quit employment at Bezos&#x27; companies all the time. Just today an important figure at Blue Origin decided to leave and switch to another space startup.<p>That would be much harder in feudalism. Not outright impossible - if they were bored with you, they wouldn&#x27;t object - but if the king wanted to keep you, it would be risky to defy him.<p>One of the reasons why Late Medieval and Renaissance Italy was such a hotbed of intellectual activity was that local nobles had only very limited reach. If you got into conflict with one prince, you could move 20 miles away and be under protection of somebody else. And that could be done almost overnight.

            I think it&#x27;s rare, at least in the US, to find people who are aware of how fucked up capitalism is. Or have ever given any real thought to how ethical it is. But its atrocities are all around us in plain sight, every time someone dies from lack of healthcare, food, or shelter - or crimes and accidents that happen in the course of pursuing these essentials.<p>To live in a world perfectly capable (in a purely physical and logistical context) of providing necessities of living for everyone regardless of their output or decisions, but chooses not to, is pretty dystopian to me.

            Capitalism doesn&#x27;t like non-capitalist systems. Any examples we possibly have of non-capitalist structures always have capitalist pressures exerted against them.

Probably a lot.<p>&gt;You are comparing against a non-existent Utopia.<p>I realize it doesn&#x27;t exist, that doesn&#x27;t mean it shouldn&#x27;t, or that the reasons it doesn&#x27;t aren&#x27;t immoral and unethical.<p>We have a lot more examples of failed capitalist countries than failed communist ones. Failure cannot be directly linked to a country&#x27;s economic system. It happens in both for a wide range of reasons.

            &gt;&gt;To pretend that established powers have not consistently and aggressively tried to stamp out threats to capitalism is ridiculous.<p>I recommend you do more research on systems that have tried to eliminate money, private property and trade. While there has been some US intervention to disrupt them, as in the case of US backed coup attempts, funding of political and armed opposition, and sanctions, the totalitarianism and dysfunction they create is so extreme that there is doubt that anti-market systems are unnatural and unworkable.<p>&gt;&gt;We have a lot more examples of failed capitalist countries than failed communist ones.<p>Look at China before and after its 1978 market reforms, or East versus West Germany, or South versus North Korea.<p>We have socialists in the West, like Jacobin magazine founder Bhaskar Sunkara defending the Berlin wall, that was used to prevent people in East Germany from fleeing, and even the brutal murder of Czar Nicholas II&#x27;s little children, to avoid admitting that socialism is harmful. Beware of who you believe.

            I totally think so. Laser tech that’s being used to zap mosquitos out of the sky could totally be repurposed to take out drones. Drones are relatively small and disabling them seems like a much easier task than taking down full fledged aircraft that fly much higher and are larger.

            I could see this. Especially robot armies marching back into the middle east. I can also see robot caregivers for the elderly. Or in cities built for pedestrians a robot walking next to you carrying your shopping bags or escorting your kids to school with a live video feed back to the parents. Fire trucks pulling up and 50 robots jumping out and running into a burning building to carry people out. Could go either way, or both.<p>Edit: I think from a seek and destroy perspective we are much more likely to go the cloud of small drones route than these. These would serve as an armed &#x2F; peace keeping &#x2F; law enforcement. presence but would not be nearly as effective in a real combat situation as the drone swarm.

            Or, rather than any of these special-purpose autonomous robots, the most likely outcome: fully-articulated telepresence robots, allowing people using VR to do anything a human could physically do, remotely. That covers pretty much all of the above use-cases and more, without assuming advances in high-level strategic AI; just good low-level motor-model learning as already exists here, plus good Internet and input methods for medium-level subsumptive motor control.

            There are a lot of use-cases for which a <i>tethered</i> telepresence robot (with, say, a five-minute emergency battery for getting swapping from one wall-socket to another) would work just fine.

            For autonomous robots, sure. And for dumb robots. But are they a problem for people—e.g. rock climbers, divers, etc.? If not, then they also wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for remote people, provided those remote people get enough sensory feedback to be aware of the relative position of the tether.<p>After all, the whole point of all this motor modelling is to enable the robot to do things humans do, like noticing when its foot lightly touches its own tether, and then using its hands to unhook the tether from its foot, temporarily pull it lightly aside, step around it, and then drop it. (Think: vacuuming a room with a tethered vacuum cleaner.) That&#x27;s a very hard thing to teach a robot to do; but a human that realizes they&#x27;re &quot;plugged in&quot; would do it almost intuitively.

            &gt; SCUBA is diving without a tether. It’s popular.<p>Look up saturation diving. The link from the diver to their dive bell — now <i>that&#x27;s</i> a tether. One critical to human life, unable to be lost for even a moment, and yet which humans freely do <i>freaking oxyacetylene welding</i> around. And yet it still works out fine, in 99.999% of dives.

Just because humans are <i>good at</i> tethers doesn&#x27;t mean they <i>like</i> them. So of course untethered telepresence robots would be better, <i>if they were practical</i>.<p>My point is that tethered human-equivalent telepresence robots — in combination with human operators who can map their intuitive management of their own body-plan into management of the robot and its tether — will be <i>practical</i> in an absolute sense, long <i>before</i> untethered human-equivalent telepresence robots become practical. We&#x27;ll have tethered telepresence &#x27;bots doing real, useful stuff out there in the world (decomissioning toxic&#x2F;irradiated structures in non-polluting ways, say—or replacing those sat divers!), long before we manage to make batteries dense enough to power untethered telepresence &#x27;bots for the same purposes.

            I&#x27;m not surprised people look at this human-like and try to attribute human-like responsibilities. It&#x27;ll be a marketing trap that many fall into.<p>But for now, the sensing, state estimation, and energy density problems preclude the use of these robots in the real world. There&#x27;s far too much uncertainty in the structure of the world or the modelling of unknown areas to do parkour outside -- unless I&#x27;ve missed something huge that boston <i>dynamics</i> has done without talking about.<p>As someone said below, however, if you can develop a hybrid control scheme with a human controlling a smart-ish legged vehicle, you&#x27;re on a roll. That&#x27;s the future for legged vehicles that I could see: something like mechwarrior or titanfall, but without the AI  (remote operated). Or Dreadnaughts. But small (as someone else pointed out).

            &gt;&gt; hybrid control scheme with a human controlling a smart-ish legged vehicle<p>Much depends on scale.  BD is working towards a robot-donkey, something that can follow soldiers over rough terrain.  At scales much larger than a horse, such robots already exist and are already much more mobile than soldiers in most terrains.  These robots are called tanks.  Or trucks.<p>Once a vehicle is carrying a large enough load that it will not fit between the trees and so cannot follow soldiers into forests, legs are not very useful.  Wheels and tracks are better than legs, particularly in soft&#x2F;wet terrain.  So large walking robots are likely never going to happen.  The MechWarrior fantasy will have to live on in things not much larger than a horse, things that can fit between trees and along footpaths.

            <i>BD is working towards a robot-donkey, something that can follow soldiers over rough terrain.</i><p>That was done years ago, as the Legged Squad Support System.[1] It sort of worked, but was too expensive and too noisy, being powered by a small IC engine. The USMC abandoned the project in 2015.<p>Boston Dynamics&#x27; big accomplishment was to get enough funding to actually do anything useful in mobile robotics. Most university robotics projects were a professor and a few grad students, and took forever to get anything. BD spent upwards of $100 million of DARPA money over a decade and got some working demos. Then they were funded by Google, and now Softbank.<p>Big walkers have been built. The Timberjack, from John Deere, is probably the best example.[2] This is a large six-legged off-road machine equipped with a long arm with a chainsaw. It worked but was not cost effective vs. wheeled systems.<p>The message is that with enough money you can do legged locomotion, but so far, there are few profitable applications.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Legged_Squad_Support_System" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Legged_Squad_Support_System</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;CD2V8GFqk_Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;CD2V8GFqk_Y</a>

            In the high mountains there are many places that are not accessible to tracked vehicles.<p>Moreover, of the places that are accessible to tracked vehicles, many are accessible only to small tracked vehicles, smaller than a typical car, and not at all to tank-sized vehicles.

            I don’t know. That just sounds like pessimism about the direction of society, which means that any technology that can be used for a wide range of tasks can obviously be used for bad things. Slowing the progress of technology is not going to solve or even improve the outcomes if society is moving in a bad direction, unless you are somehow able to very precisely predict the outcomes of each specific technology and slow progress very selectively. And if you were able to do that, I don’t think technologies like this one would be a likely candidate for something that would disproportionately help the bad actors in society.

            If we retain the same semi-centralised power structures for governing society, then I think it&#x27;s unavoidable that we will face the scenario you mention.

            It really depends on how exactly you decentralize. Decentralization doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean complete independence of the fragments; they can still federate into larger entities, and those entities can enforce such things. The trick is to make the power flow from the bottom up, not from the top down.<p>Here&#x27;s a real world contemporary attempt to implement some approximation to that.

            It&#x27;s just policy and tools. Regardless of the tools used certain policies are enforced.<p>The robots&#x2F;technologies are just tools. You have opreasive govenments spanning generations without robots and you have democracies as well.<p>I certainly want more robots around to do the boring and risky jobs.<p>Even if wars are conducted using robots(which is pretty innevitable) I see it as a good thing.

            &quot;AI Robot cops show implicit bias resulting in 3 deaths&quot; is a headline today if you remove the AI robot part. As evidenced by the comments in this thread and any other on these robots, the public is extremely skeptical of them. If they do indeed exhibit these kinds of harms, the public will likely enact severe restrictions on them. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we end up in a situation where a lot of benefits are left on the table due to over-caution, just as you might see with self-driving cars that kill fewer people but are highlighted in the news when the rare accident does happen.

            The robots will just become drones (remotely controlled by humans). BD demos are great to show that these will be autonomously ambulatory (you just tell them which direction to move, they manage the low-level concerns of the movement).<p>We won&#x27;t trust AI with decision-making, but we will trust the status-quo police forces to dish out violence from the safety of an office.

            Bundling BD&#x27;s work with loss of privacy, face recog, etc. is so far fetched. This is just such an illinformed fearful stance that is cliche with any robotic innovation - it gets a disproportionate amount of pessimism (because robots!). Motorized controls of arms and limbs is physical intelligence, a very small slice of &quot;AI&quot; if you want to call that. &quot;Overlords&quot; meme has infested most of YT comments and but surprised to see it on HN. Disproportionate attention to physical visceral things - especially if it looks like humans - is particularly prone to fear response.<p>Have you ever seen your cat&#x2F;dog stare at a look-alike version of stuffed toy and become completely bamboozled? Humans are particularly magnetized by anything that has 2 legs and moves like itself. No one bats an eye on a sentry with a gatling gun, but how dare you put 2 legs under it - sudden dystopia.

            I think the developed world&#x27;s headed nigh-inevitably toward something more closely resembling the Chinese model of government—maybe not with autocratic leadership, but with similar levels of centralized surveillance and such, extensive Internet filtering and blocking, and yeah, probably a lot more robots in law enforcement (military? Definitely yes in China if it makes cost&#x2F;benefit sense, and maybe in the West whether it does or not—yes in either case for flying drones, that&#x27;s already well underway)<p>I think we&#x27;ll find states that fail to do that, suffer. The other way out is rejection of technology to a large extent, but I doubt many will try that model as it&#x27;d cause a large &amp; swift hit to quality of life.<p>(why, yes, I do have a fairly large technological-determinism and social-groups-experience-evolution-like-anything-else-does streak, why do you ask?)

            States that don&#x27;t implement those forms of totalitarian surveillance&#x2F;control will not suffer.

            If they were ever deployed as auxiliaries to law enforcement, my hope would be any weapon would have to have a human approve a request.<p>Robots should be able to swarm and restrain uncooperative suspects so there should be less need for lethality unless the perpetrator is an active threat against other people -a hostage situation, mass shooting, etc.

            Do do we want more uniform enforcement via robot, or do we want more leeway for human LEOs?<p>It used to be cops could make their own decisions on the spot about a subject (good or bad), now with cameras there is much much less ad-hoc decision making.

            Initial economic impact will be harder for those whose job is simply moving things&#x2F;people around. And those people, obviously aren&#x27;t aware of the problem they&#x27;ll face in a few years (5-10?).
Thats the real problem in the near horizon.

            I&#x27;m reminded of the robot that goes wrong in Robocop. Except, with Reinforcement Learning, we&#x27;ll have a robot that executes hundreds flawlessly until stopped. This is the kind of advancement that should be regulated, IMHO.

            All these positions involve life and death decisions that freak me out.<p>I want the source code to firefighting bots to be public so I know whether my town buys the ones that prioritize babies over elderly. Or stuff like it’s easier to save 5 dogs than 1 human.<p>Nurses too have great power for good and harm. Currently when nurses decide on mercy killings [0] it requires lots of deliberation to figure out and it’s just one person.

            This is awesome, but until someone solves the real-time sensing and modelling problem, it&#x27;ll never fly in the real world.  The use case is still warehouses.<p>Here&#x27;s my logic &#x2F; assumptions:
How does the robot &quot;know&quot; (have sufficient model information to predict the response) that the board will hold it when it does a vault? It doesn&#x27;t -- it is told to vault by placing one limb on top. As we&#x27;ve seen with self-driving cars, where the sensing is 99% of the problem, that&#x27;s the barrier between a closed set and the real world.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The fact that Atlas &#x2F; Boston Dynamics is in a state where the sensing is _mostly_ what remains a problem is <i>astounding</i>.

            Yes! Your warehouse would have to be a cleanroom (someone left a can of soda?

            It&#x27;s easy to forget sometimes, in the era of cars, how much we gave up when most people in industrialized society stopped riding horses.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to get a horse to careen off a cliff or straight into a tree.

            Horses are easy to startle and they will crash into a tree at 35mph just to get you off their back when startled. They also don&#x27;t like people standing or walking behind their backs; being kicked by a horse is a common injury, sometimes fatal.<p>&gt; Ten army corps were observed over 20 years, giving a total of 200 observations of one corps for a one year period. The period or module of observation is thus one year. The total deaths from horse kicks were 122, and the average number of deaths per year per corps was thus 122&#x2F;200 = 0.61.[1]<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mathsnetalevel.com&#x2F;2406" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mathsnetalevel.com&#x2F;2406</a>

            Right, but is parkour a well-understood problem with formulas and solutions?<p>I think there&#x27;s also a tendency to go &quot;You just need linear regression&quot; a lot when actually, well, there is a reason people are excited about new AI techniques: they make things that were very difficult much easier, and they make some things possible that never were before.<p>Is deep learning &#x2F; reinforcement learning actually useful here?

            Well. yes. Using AI means you learn one theory, and now you can do voice recognition, chess and parkour with state of the art performance (except perhaps when it comes to minimising compute) ...<p>And then there&#x27;s where it takes off. There isn&#x27;t a single human that can come anywhere close to the language knowledge base AI algorithms can build up. Even a team of 100 humans would not have the breadth of languages algorithms have these days. Yes, context understanding humans still have the edge, but it&#x27;s shrinking every day. But so many language aspects, from translation to grammar, machines outperform all but the very best humans, and 99.9% of all humans even within one language.

            Yeah but I reckon these kind of robots won&#x27;t be deployed strictly against human snipers. The average enemy won&#x27;t have the skill nor equipment to retaliate against long range, rapid fire sniping.<p>A robot, maybe with drone support, could be really accurate at launching grenades or unguided mortar rounds. Or hell, attach it to an artillery gun. Much cheaper than missiles.

            Would it be incorrect to say that the primary problems Boston Dynamics works on, which is planning and controls, is already mostly a solved problem?<p>My understanding is that the majority of research was completed within the past few decades, in comparison to the relative nascency of modern deep learning techniques.

            My guess (as an engineer but not in that field) is that some sort of breakthrough is needed or it will be a long slog. The general problem of robots navigating arbitrary spaces will probably be solved by wider advances in machine learning. Because a robot mapping its environment, planning its motion, and carrying out that motion while adapting to the dynamic environment, isn&#x27;t being treated as a classic control systems problem any more, but fed into trained nets. It&#x27;s too broad a problem for even sophisticated control systems, in the general case.<p>Even once robots can do amazing things, there needs to be an economic use case that&#x27;s compatible with what they can do, how they&#x27;re powered, and how long they can work for.<p>Similar to quadcopters in a way - they have changed the world in some limited ways, but so far they haven&#x27;t scaled up to carry people or out to deliver parcels, so they remain niche. If someone figures out one day that robots can deliver burritos&#x2F;assassinate dissidents&#x2F;stack shelves efficiently, it could be a quick takeoff.

            The thing that looks weird imo is when the robots are running on flat ground, something looks off about their feet. Can&#x27;t tell what it is but they look like they&#x27;re floating. Anyway it&#x27;s pretty amazing, and interesting to see the improvements over the years in how the robots move.<p>And clearly the two robots should fight.

            No. But it&#x27;s just a demo.<p>In perfect conditions if you run it 100 times this is the result.<p>In the real world they have no application as they fail pretty much always in real conditions. But this is research, pushing things in controlled conditions help you learn what you can do in less controlled conditions. Though sometimes it&#x27;s just a deadend.<p>The exact same thing is true of YouTuber stunt videos. Any very impressive stunt was failed hundreds of times but they show you the footage where they pulled it off. The thing to remember is that media is largely fake or deceiving, presenting the very best and not the reality.

            The current robots are a research platform, not a commercial product.  The idea is that eventually it would be able to do things like that and many more, but currently huge amounts of choreography and testing are required to produce videos like this one. They&#x27;ve come a long way, but they&#x27;ve still got a <i>long</i> way to go before they could go into an uncontrolled situation and perform usefully, let alone with the level of aptitude apparent here.

            They&#x27;re good at certain things like movement but task planning and execution are still under development. You could maybe use the current version to explore burning buildings but they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do much more than that, you don&#x27;t see these lifting shifting loads or dragging things ever which is the kind of things they&#x27;d need to do for the toxic cleanup or fire rescue tasks.<p>For the war fighting it&#x27;s pretty much always more effective to use things like tanks or drones rather than dealing with walking motions, that&#x27;s still pretty inefficient.

            Note that parent said working in conflict areas, not necessarily fighting.  I can imagine various jobs where this form factor might be useful.  Clearing rubble for instance, or dealing with mines or other explosives.  Each individual task might be better handled by something purpose-built, but a humanoid robot could be more versatile.

            Mostly only when dealing with tools designed for humans, you can generally design the same tools to be more efficient on a general platform base. And even if you do use them you run into similar problems with task planning and execution. Finally there&#x27;s power issues with the humanoid shaped bots both in the strength of the actuators (it&#x27;s hard to have both really strong, fast and precise all in a package that fits) and in providing power to the robot itself. The latter has been the death of many a walking bot intended for the military, batteries don&#x27;t last long enough and gas power plants are loud and generally bulky.

            It looked fake to me immediately. Maybe just uncanny valley since the movements are not very human-like — I&#x27;m not sure. But the lighting on the machines looks all wrong to me (although the shadows do look accurate, and the audio also seems convincing).

They may not be the best design for any particular task, but if you wanted to build one platform that could perform a wide variety of physical tasks, we already know that a human form factor is capable of doing that.”</i><p>No, they’re not “humanoids”, and it’s chilling to hear them call it that.<p>But more simply than that: this will be used for war and human surveillance and response.

            The robot did pump its arm, but it also stumbled a bit on this simple move. It was just the slightest stutter step, something most people watching the video would never notice. But the Atlas team notices every detail and they want to get it right.<p>“We hadn’t run that behavior after the backflip before today, so that was really an experiment,” says Scott Kuindersma, the Atlas team lead at Boston Dynamics. “If you watch the video closely, it looks a little awkward. We’re going to swap in a behavior we’ve tested before so we have some confidence it will work.”

            I&#x27;m going to assume that most &#x27;killer robots&#x27; will be reasonably heavily armoured, so unless you have very powerful AP rounds the best approach will be to disable rather than destroy. They&#x27;ll also likely be hardened against &#x27;jammers&#x27; or any radio interference.<p>Presumably most systems will use multiple sensors and vision systems, LiDAR, RADAR, etc. The key would be to disable enough of each to put the machine in &#x27;safe mode&#x27;.<p>Vision systems are the easiest to attack. A cheap paintball gun, spray can, or fire extinguisher would be more than capable of disabling a camera system.<p>LiDAR would likely also be fairly easy to disable. Most LiDAR systems also depend on visual light, and have a revolving sensor of some sort (though there are some fixed units as well) which have their own weaknesses. A reasonably powerful pellet gun, or most rifles or pistols would be enough to disable a revolving lidar sensor, and a few shots with paint would disable a fixed unit, much like a camera.<p>It&#x27;s almost certain the designer of such robots will think of these attacks and build around them. Think windshield wipers or compressed air to clear debris. So, the ideal material would be very thick, very sticky, and completely opaque. It would also need a high pressure container and a nozzle that produces a laminar stream to hit the sensors from at least 10m away.

            Why is it that so many people&#x27;s thoughts go to &quot;killer robots&quot; when they see a humanoid robot, but not when they see, for instance, a quad copter? Or an assembly line robotic arm? Is it literally <i>just</i> Terminator? I guess more likely Terminator was made because it plays on a deeper psychological phemonenon—a fear of entities that look similar to us, but different. (Which presumably evolves from a rational fear of hostile outsiders to one&#x27;s tribe. The same instinct that causes other maladaptive impulses in modern society, like jingoism and racism.)

            For a very aggressive answer, I would go for one of those shotguns with two magazine tubes you can switch between. Anti-drone projectiles in one and rifled slugs in the other.<p>Less destructively, a good net launcher seems like it&#x27;d stand a decent chance at fouling things but they are usually single shot and inaccurate at any kind of range.

            shaped charge type 40mm HE grenades would be fine if you have to defend against a heavily armoured killer robot, but ones like this with exposed hydraulic lines will fall over and curl up after a well placed knife attack, or maybe 12ga flechette rounds from a shotgun if you need a ranged attack.

            If these become a serious concern to where simply throwing crap on the sensors isn&#x27;t enough, small scale EMPs aren&#x27;t that complicated. Using a fast explosive to blast a magnet through a few coils of wire will make a fairly powerful locallized pulse, although it is likely super illegal.

            It’s kind of hard to fling paint, but I guess just making a potato gun that spits out paint should be good.<p>I’ll be looking for some Holi festival type gear.

            Good idea but when I used them the balls were fairly small and not very accurate. So hitting cameras might be tough to do completely enough to block visit.<p>Is there a paintball shotgun?<p>Yes, there are [0]. But it seems like they shoot “slugs” and not a spray of paint in a cone.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paintballglobe.com&#x2F;paintball-shotgun&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paintballglobe.com&#x2F;paintball-shotgun&#x2F;</a>

            Some sort of high tensile wires that their limbs can’t overcome. Flexible materials are computationally hard even for actual humans, let alone for bunch of Python scripts running on a random Docker container somewhere.<p>Or Reason. Whichever available. Aim for torso.

            For me, my interest is in sort of lateral thinking for any problem. For novel situations, I like to think of what the positive and negative impacts are and particularly what “hacks” might be able to get unexpected outcomes.<p>I’m typically like this for everything, but for robots that can jump around and stuff (and will likely soon do police and military actions) this is novel enough for me to explore this for the first time.<p>I think similarly about facial recognition software for how to evade and confuse. And also for biometrics, locks,  etc. Any of these things are interesting to me and I want to know how to do stuff with them.
