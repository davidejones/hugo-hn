            Why won&#x27;t they? The other day I needed a set of air hose tools and looked it up at Amazon, saw it for $19.  Went to my local store auto parts store because I wanted to support my local business and they have a fraction of the Amazon set for $42.  I ordered it from Amazon and had it in 12 hours.   Needed lawn mower filters, at  home depot, it was $10.99 for 1 filter.   For the 2 types I wanted, got them for $8.99 for 4 and 5 pieces.   Using amazon is not even fair.  I won&#x27;t buy food, expensive electronics, or really bulky items from them, but for most things they are seriously crushing the competitors.

            &gt; Using amazon is not even fair. ...but for most things they are seriously crushing the competitors.<p>Not in my experience.  I&#x27;ve seriously dialed back my usage of them, but what started me on that path several years ago was comparison shopping for the first time in a long time, and finding that local stores usually matched and sometimes beat Amazon&#x27;s prices.  Why wait 3+ days for two day shipping when I could literally pick it up now for the same price?  Now the main issue I have is all the garbage products with fake reviews.

            The main advantage of Amazon is not the price IMO. It is the fact that I don&#x27;t have to deal with driving up to Walmart&#x2F;Target, navigating through the crowd, standing in the line, traffic, etc and robbing 2 hours of my day. Click and it shows up at the door is the best part of any online shopping experience, Amazon&#x27;s 2 day shipment is the cherry on the cake.

            The article doesn&#x27;t mention Walmart&#x27;s website, which has become very good and widely used, especially as a more trustworthy source for real products than Amazon.com.<p>Also the article is worded as if Walmart is in decline- the future is bright for both of these companies, not that anyone is concerned.

            Walmart is getting better, but still way behind on the web front.  They&#x27;ll show you things in stock, then tell you it&#x27;s out of stock upon checkout. Go back to product page, shows in stock again.  They also use way, way too many captchas.  Lastly, they divide walmart.com from walmart pickup and delivery for no reason.  Some things you order on the .com side are only &#x27;shippable&#x27; if your local store has it.  So, it&#x27;s pickup and delivery yet doesn&#x27;t show up on that side.  I laughed because when I ordered a fishing rod for my child, it was literally a fishing rod leaned against my house.  No box, label, etc.<p>I still try to use them as I trust their products more than Amazon.  I love their new tool lineup, quality stuff at a decent price, with next day or 2 day delivery.  I really like that for returns, they&#x27;ll come pick it up.  AMZ charges extra for that.<p>Amazon has much better CS though, hands down.

            The Walmart.com and pickup&#x2F;delivery division on their website is not a thing anymore. They seem to be testing a new beta version of the website, and I got to try it yesterday. I have Walmart plus and this is how it went:<p>One seamless search option, no pickup&#x2F;delivery and Walmart.com options. I added everything, including groceries and other non groceries to my cart. I selected delivery. Some items were not available in my local store but it didn&#x27;t matter. Walmart automatically divided my order into two parts, where it decided to ship me some of the things I ordered (chips and club soda) that weren&#x27;t available at my local store. It was definitely great experience and the UI was clean. I didn&#x27;t get any out of stock errors at checkout too. Can&#x27;t wait to use it full time.<p>The only reason I use Walmart is that I don&#x27;t trust the products from Amazon anymore, even when they are sold by Amazon. I once ordered shampoo sold my Amazon that was obviously fake, and then I searched around and realized Amazon has a program where they gather the products from different sellers and put it in one huge bin and call all of them sold by Amazon.com

            &gt;  I once ordered shampoo sold my Amazon that was obviously fake, and then I searched around and realized Amazon has a program where they gather the products from different sellers and put it in one huge bin and call all of them sold by Amazon.com<p>This is a common scam. Third party sellers will send a fake product to Amazon to be FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon). When someone buys this product from the seller on the product&#x27;s webpage, the seller is hoping the buyer will actually receive a genuine Amazon product instead that happens to already be in the warehouse. The buyer will be happy and will not complain, so the seller receives their money. However that fake product is still sitting in the warehouse, and when some unlucky buyer receives the fake product, they&#x27;ll demand a refund. Some unlucky third party seller will have to foot the bill for that refund.<p>Youtuber &quot;chaseontwowheels&quot; ordered a $6000 camera Sold and Shipped by Amazon.com. He instead received a box of rocks. He got a refund from a suspicious Amazon and shipped him another camera. While filming a video about the incident, he opened the box and it was rocks again. He ended up buying the camera from B&amp;H and finally got the legitimate product.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diyphotography.net&#x2F;buyer-orders-6000-camera-amazon-receives-box-rocks-twice&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diyphotography.net&#x2F;buyer-orders-6000-camera-amaz...</a><p>I&#x27;ve run into a similar problem. I ordered an electric beard trimmer and the box looked new but there was hair inside so it was obviously used. There were a lot of recent reviews about this from different sellers. I&#x27;m assuming some third party seller sent a bunch of returned stuff to Amazon and they threw it all into the same bin.

            How do I get access to this beta? I would shop at Walmart a lot more but their website has been hot garbage as far back as I can remember. The exact scenario you mentioned is what makes it a miserable experience. I just tried it again<p>1) I put in my zipcode and checkmark my store. 
2) I search for &quot;AA batteries&quot;
1) I put in my zipcode again and checkmark my store because it forgot the previous search. 
3) I select In store pickup
4) As I scroll it co-mingles results that are in store with results that require a shipment. Seems like it does this for items that are not sold by walmart so while it correctly filtered out items sold by walmart that require shipment, whats the point if items not sold by walmart are still there.<p>As a sidenote, it does not tell me where in the store the item is. I just want to get item location, go into the store and pick it up.<p>Back in 2016 I tried the ship to store service. When I arrived, I went to the back of the store in order to pick it up. I was the only one there. I signed in on their kiosk and then waited. The clerk disappeared into the back and I kid you not, it took 30 mins to retrieve my order. She couldn&#x27;t care less about getting my package. Keep in mind that I was the only one there and their fancy screen was listing my name as the only one in the queue!<p>The cherry on top of all of this is that their prices and selection are not always competitive with Amazon in my experience. It would be fine given that I am guaranteed to get legitimate equipment and get it same day but all the issues above steal enough time that it makes it not worth it most of the time.<p>I assume Walmart Labs is developing all this stuff. They must have better work life balance because their output is nowhere near the quality of Amazon.<p>I find this problem with Target to an extent as well. They have a better ship to store experience but I have found that their inventory status on their website has no correlation to reality whatsoever and their search is terrible. I have been trying to build an app to scrape all their items so I could build a personal tool that works better. I really want to avoid Amazon if I can but the competitors just make it so hard to do so.

            I can&#x27;t say the experience has changed a lot on the pickup side.  I bought a few hooks and thought I&#x27;d zip on by for curbside.  Huge mistake.  Every spot was filled, people hanging out of their car looking miserable like they&#x27;d been there a long time.  I made a loop and parked while I assessed everything, and in the five or so minutes I was there, never saw an employee.  This was just last week.  I&#x27;ll definitely not do pickup again.

            That&#x27;s great to hear - thanks for sharing.  I&#x27;m also a plus member, but I guess not in the beta.  The app and website both still segregate the two.<p>How you describe it working is exactly how I&#x27;ve always wished it would work.  Glad to hear it.

            &gt; <i>they divide walmart.com from walmart pickup and delivery for no reason</i><p>I can hazard an informed guess as to why that is -- they built .com as an independent company, in order to get it off the ground faster and with less interference from the brick and mortar side.<p>End result: quick iteration, but now two completely separate supply chains. You&#x27;d be amazing how complicated warehousing, inventory, shipping, etc. get when you&#x27;ve got 2 SKUs for every item + a bunch of hacks to duct tape everything together.<p>And it&#x27;s not trivial to reconverged them, when you&#x27;re as optimized as Walmart logistics is.

            HomeDepot and Bestbuy are what I would hold up as the best websites.  Target is decent too, except they started allowed resellers and I was not as easily able to find how to restrict to items sold only by Target.

            Good engineering teams working with KISS frameworks build good sites. Counter example: Sears.<p>Resellers are a necessary evil for warehouse retail. You need the scale for margin and product diversity for long tail sales, but you&#x27;ve got to keep a tight leash on them. I can&#x27;t begin to express how unreliable their submitted metadata about listed items is.<p>I feel like auditing and kicking people off the platform would honestly be the best approach, although that&#x27;d probably just cause more fly by night &quot;new&quot; vendor signups.

            Menards is great for this. The stores tend to fullfill orders and ship. Also, you have flexibility in how you get it shipped. Also, they tend to show live POS stock counts.

            I know I&#x27;m starting to sound like a shill, but I&#x27;m just impressed with the progress they&#x27;ve made recently... but Walmart does this too.<p>Any in store purchase made with a credit card saved in your account shows up in your purchase history.

            Target was good 5 years ago. These days they&#x27;re pushing more and more items into &quot;same day delivery&quot; only with some gimmicky subscription service. No thanks - I&#x27;m looking for a transaction, not a long term relationship. If you really want to charge for shipping, then reduce your prices so that the cost of shipping is no longer built in.<p>And yeah, the &quot;marketplace&quot; cancer is everywhere. It&#x27;s turned Amazon into trash, yet traditional companies seemingly can&#x27;t help but follow in their footsteps. If I want to sort through vendor reputations for gensym-branded white label gadgets, I&#x27;ll go to eBay or AliExpress.<p>FWIW the Home Depot website is much faster if you use noscript to block all of their surveillance vendors. Probably the worst website I&#x27;ve seen with regards to that - by default I think they backhaul all of your mouse movement.

            &gt; Walmart is getting better, but still way behind on the web front. They&#x27;ll show you things in stock, then tell you it&#x27;s out of stock upon checkout. Go back to product page, shows in stock again.<p>2 weeks ago I added a Logitech mouse to my cart which Amazon claimed would arrive in 2 days per the product page. Upon checkout I was informed that it was unavailable to ship and I would get an e-mail when they knew it would ship.  Going back to the product page and refreshing the 2 day promised arrival date was still there.  It arrived 6 days later.  Seems like Amazon has similar problems.

            Walmart app does this too actually.  The main problem is that their inventory tracker is wildly inaccurate.

            Why? They know what items are being delivered to the store, they know when they are delivered and they know what they sold. Ignoring inventory numbers being slightly off due to shrinkage, if you just connect the systems you can get a pretty accurate real time count.

            And most importantly they have only one listing for the same item. In Amazon and Walmart you have multiple listings of the same product by different sellers at different prices. In Amazon it&#x27;s really annoying to see several pages of basically the same product.

            Amazon tries to coalesce these pages together in a single product-detail page with multiple offers. Sellers frequently try to avoid this coalescing (because otherwise, they&#x27;re only competing on price). This could be as simple as pad printing a meaningless 5-6 character brand onto the product [making it technically different] or by making the description slightly different.

            Yeah, it&#x27;s a tough problem to solve.  But I understand their complaint, it&#x27;s often an identical product with a different name painted on it, pages and pages.<p>My favorite was a handheld coffee grinder.  The item was unbranded, and the manual had some brand name manually scratched out with an inkpen everywhere it was mentioned.  It&#x27;s actually a nice coffee grinder, believe it or not.

            &gt;  I really like that for returns, they&#x27;ll come pick it up. AMZ charges extra for that.<p>Oof, not in the UK. (At least not with Prime.)<p>Perhaps not quite as easy (for small enough items) as when I mostly commuted, and could print a label and leave it in an outgoing mail pile, but certainly from home I way prefer that than going to a post office (even in the absence of coronavirus restrictions).<p>I actually bought a printer for that purpose. A direct thermal label printer, because that&#x27;s all I needed it for (and it was cheaper, has no ink to run out&#x2F;dry out during a period of no use, etc.).

            It actually depends on who their partner is.  In my last city, it was USPS, so I could in fact put it with the mail.<p>Where I live now, Amazon delivers but uses UPS for returns.  I can either drop it off at a Kohl&#x27;s location, a UPS store, or pay for them to come pick it up.<p>Normally it&#x27;s not a huge hassle, but it&#x27;s a really nice gesture to me, especially for heavy items.  I almost kept a TV stand, new in box, that I didn&#x27;t need because I didn&#x27;t feel like carrying it back into the store.  Luckily, that&#x27;s when I noticed they&#x27;ll do free pickup on returns.

            Oh interesting. We tend not to really have variations like that across the UK (not having different states in the same way), so beyond remote islands etc. (by post code) and things like Uber&#x2F;Deliveroo rolling out city by city&#x2F;town by town, it&#x27;s all just the same.<p>Amazon uses various couriers to deliver and return here (even me being in one location, in London, but also the same in the country) but when you select a return only Hermes offer pick-up. (Otherwise there&#x27;s Amazon locker, Royal Mail print label, Royal Mail drop-off, various other drop-off places of the kind that are a sort of &#x27;side gig&#x27; for a grocer or newsagent, etc.)

            Oh, another example of that local vs distant store thing is that it&#x27;s kinda up to the store. You may order a BROWN blanket, but your local store is somehow notified and they go, OH I HAVE THAT BLANKET! And then they switch you from it being delivered from far away to having some guy that&#x27;s getting off work that lives near you drop it off. And then you open it up and it&#x27;s that BLUE blanket you already saw locally and didn&#x27;t want!!!!!

            I thought the problem with that was even if you chose to &quot;buy&quot; a product from Amazon, if a 3rd party seller is using Amazon&#x27;s warehousing, Amazon intermingles products that they source themselves and from the 3rd party? So, you could be getting a product sourced by Amazon, or you could be getting a product sourced by a 3rd party.

            They definitely removed it years ago, at least for me.  The option to check mark “Amazon.com” as the seller was there and then it wasn’t over and over, and then eventually just disappeared.<p>Edit:  I just searched shelf and hot sauce on Amazon.Com on iOS Safari, and the filter options do not show any way to restrict to items sold by Amazon.com.

            I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about the profitability, at least for non-amazon stores, none have the volume to make it worth their while. But what they are going for is trying to get somewhere close to the wide selection that amazon has.<p>If you need something specialized like say, upholstery glue, Walmart may have 5-6 different options, one or two of which might be sold by Walmart themselves, if you are lucky. Which means likely long shipping times for all the others as they won&#x27;t qualify for Walmart plus or whatever they call it.<p>If you search that on Amazon, you will find probably 30-40 different brands and types of upholstery glue available in all difference sizes, in a jug, in a spray bottle, bulk sized, etc. Most of which is available for Prime 1-2 day shipping and will show up next day.<p>Walmart and other retailers need to be working with some warehouse logistics companies that basically do what amazon FBA. Because as it is, most of the 3rd party listings on other retail sites are just drop shippers trying to arbitrage off Amazon or ebay products. If you buy from them, the seller will just purchase it from Amazon or ebay and have it shipped to you.<p>The rest are sellers that already sell on Amazon and ebay and just check the Walmart box in their listing management software to add a few more sales here and there. But without amazon and ebay, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to maintain their business on Walmart, target, and probably about every other retail platform combined.<p>And I&#x27;m not even sure if ebay amounts to much any more. When I was in the business a few years ago, ebay did still account for maybe 20% of sales. I assume that has gone down, but likely varies depending on category.

            Trustworth? not sure sure.  Walmart 3rd party seller is hard to contact for a return in case of problem.  Walmart seems set up a way encouraging shop from Walmart own source than 3rd party on Walmart web site, which I don&#x27;t blame them as that&#x27;s where most of Amazon&#x27;s problem came from.<p>However, Amazon does have one key appealing, regardless who&#x27;s the seller Amazon almost guarantees the free return, where in Walmart you&#x27;d better take it back to Walmart store even it&#x27;s sold by Walmart themselves.<p>The return policy is the one single reason Amazon trumped all other online e-commerce which is not hard to see but difficult to clone.

            Find small companies with a web presence and buy from them.  They type that ship their own product.  You will pay a tiny bit more, but because they know their product, and so the description on the website will reflect that.  We have 4 different devices that will work, here is why you would choose each.  In depth reviews.  If you still have questions someone will answer the phone when you call who knows something about the product in question and so can direct you to the right one for you.

            I use both sites for shopping. Walmart has free (roughly) two day shipping if you spend $35+. For bulkier items and (frequently IME) better prices, I prefer Walmart to Amazon Prime.<p>I have major concerns over fraudulent or quid pro quo reviews on Amazon, and the prices generally aren&#x27;t the best around. Free (or rather included) next day shipping is great though.

            According to the page those numbers refer to FY 2019 or FY 2020. Per the second paragraph of TFA for the last 12 months Amazon has an estimated 610 billion in sales (which are part of revenue), not FY aligned. This actually lines up pretty closely to just naively expanding the y&#x2F;y growth rate on the page you linked over time. In reality it slightly outperformed that.

            Walmart is ahead of Amazon by some 60B in q1 q2 rev and its increasing as covid effect&#x2F;ecom sales start dropping. They will easily be ahead 100-120B ahead at the end of the year. Amazon cant touch those number any time soon unless covid suddenly surges and lockdowns restart.

            Price controls. It&#x27;s always (AFAI can tell) price controls, whether de facto or de jure. That seems to be <i>the</i> uniting factor in successful healthcare systems. Even Singapore, the closest thing I know of to a &quot;free market healthcare <i>can</i> work!&quot; darling, has some price controls (and uses the <i>very real</i> threat of imposing more to keep the rest of the prices under control).

            When a shopper enters a Walmart they have a fixed amount of money in their pocket and generally a good idea of what they want. You might get them to grab a candy bar, or buy the next grade up of tires, but it is effectively shifting dollars that would have been spent there already. Revenue growth is all about adding more essential items to the store and eliminating trips to other retailers.<p>Amazon has much more discretionary budget to try and extract from their customers, so time on site is absolutely critical.<p>I&#x27;d say the two aren&#x27;t even competitive at this point. Amazon will need many years to build out a robust vertically integrated grocery logistics network that reaches Walmart customers. A few Whole Foods in rich neighborhoods isn&#x27;t going to cut it. On the other hand, Walmart will never figure out how to sell stuff online without losing money, and will probably kill itself trying to chase Amazon for some unknown reason.
