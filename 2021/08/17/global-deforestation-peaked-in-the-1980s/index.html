            This is somewhat of a misleading headline. Yes, the <i>rate</i> of deforestation may have peaked in 1980s. There is also not very good data on this before 1990s. The estimate of forested areas in the context of our land use distribution are still in decline.<p>Now this is adjacent but whats more important in my mind is not reflected in any of these data; that is to say that most of the planet&#x27;s savanna have been completely lost. Savanna are arguably more important than forest due to the sequestration of carbon in-ground systems (as opposed to woody biomass) and the amount of caloric availability they offer to wild animals. They thus support a huge amount of biomass (though not necessarily biofuel, like a forest).<p>Some of the areas that are being afforested originally would have been savannas but due to biodiversity loss, they succeed directly to forests (no animals to control the spread of trees). By some estimates less than 1% of North American oak savanna still exists today.

            I found a great little link that compares deforestation &#x2F; reforestation over time for different countries sorted by things like GDP.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;forests-and-deforestation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;forests-and-deforestation</a><p>As you can see, most wealthy countries have been increasing their forest cover since 1990 (and indeed since the late 1970&#x27;s though this graph doesn&#x27;t go back that far).  As poorer countries increase their industrial base and means of wealth production, they too will be able to afford to take care of their environments as well as a the West does.

            Yes, this is exactly what I was talking about. In the US for example, almost all of our historical savanna has been replaced by forests. The upper midwest used to be mostly oak savana biome but since the advent of afforestation those areas, mostly regrow as forest. This shift seems most related to eradication of native species which were able to maintain a system at certain level of ecological succession. So maybe without wolves, bison, passenger pigeons, (maybe even mastodon) these ecosystems aren&#x27;t able to regrow and we instead get a much less biodiverse forest. There is some suspicion this has been the case for several hundred years as oral history from native American tribes suggests they at one time overhunted these resources and afterwards took an active hand in managing some of these ecosystems. However since the native Americans never cleared these areas they may have been in a better position to maintain them (mostly via controlled fires) whereas modern Americans are often starting with farm fields.<p>Anyways yes, afforestation is happening at good clip but much of it is plantation and a lot of the afforested areas were never previously forest. The same is true in other countries from what I have seen. Even India has massive afforestation but most is agroforestry.<p>A lot still remains to be seen. It&#x27;s possible that these forests don&#x27;t make sense as carbon sinks.  Savana systems for local agriculture could be more efficient at mitigating carbon emissions. Nearly a third of land is now used for grazing worldwide and much of the output is shipped internationally.<p>Like many other systems in nature and otherwise, it&#x27;s very complex. So I&#x27;m not so sure the 90&#x27;s era practice of reducing deforestation to simple arithmetic is constructive in an era where scientific community is pushing to maximize carbon sinks.

            Is the savanah really an effective carbon sink, or is this still based on the (recently discredited) humus theory of soil?

            Not related. The suspected importance of savanna is more based on biodiversity than soil science. In these biomes, you have comparatively large amounts of animal and insect biomass. You have animals constantly eating the plants. This causes deep rooted plants which can regenerate quickly to dominate as they grow back intermittently. The sequestered carbon is mostly in the plants and animals as opposed to soil. Measuring biomass accumulation below ground is more difficult than above ground (counting trees is pretty easy).<p>However some land use pattern studies have looked at which areas have historically been savanna normally show overlap with heavy agriculture regions as the soil is so good. In some cases these former oak savannas in the US will have dozens of feet of fertile topsoil. So there&#x27;s some speculation that the high soil fertility in such biomes is due to compaction from grazing animals, which I guess is not related to the humus theory, but would be a similar idea about how so much carbon can accumulate.

            Humus stabilizing in soil is the result of mycorhizzae extracting mineral elements from the soil and exchanging that for carbohydrates. The humus theory was that humus is an essential nutrient. If humus theory were true carbon would be removed, not added to soil. That theory was debunked more than 20 y ago.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.nutri-tech.com.au&#x2F;mycorrhizal-magic-new-biological-breakthrough&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.nutri-tech.com.au&#x2F;mycorrhizal-magic-new-biologi...</a>

            Based on the map, this looks like a problem that will be solved with money. The tropical regions are less wealthy than the temperate regions, and probably as they become more wealthy, they will urbanize and improve farming techniques, both of which require less land, which nature is then able to re-capture.

            The article says that deforestation <i>peaked</i> 30-40 years ago.<p>&quot;Global forest loss peaked in the 1980s – losing an area half the size of India. Since then, deforestation has slowed. In fact, many countries have now reversed the long-term trend and transitioned to a net gain of forests, reforestation.&quot;<p>So clearly something is working. A lot of the responses are assuming that deforestation rate of growth is continuing or even accelerating, especially the random remarks attributing deforestation to all sorts of things. The world is on a re-forestation trend, according to the article.

            Ok,let&#x27;s stop and think. The article is saying that the rate of deforestation stopped increasing in the 1980s, and since then we&#x27;ve made gains on reforestation as well as stopping the increase in deforestation rate. What exactly would you like the alternative to be? A re-increase in deforestation rates? A halt to reforestation?<p>Yes, wishful thinking would be that it would be nice if we didn&#x27;t have all that deforestation to begin with, but here we are, reversing that trend, and somehow there&#x27;s an alternative that would be better than that? What alternative to reducing the rate of deforestation and increasing reforestation is there?

            Possibly.  Certainly in the US we have regained forest as marginal farmland was allowed to revert to forest or in some cases converted to forest so that now many places that are conservation land wildernesses are forested as opposed to grazing land and farmland.<p>On the other hand, a growing population means more demand for wood products (for building, for furniture, etc) and the alternative, plastics, are quite problematic.

            Sounds like there will be a sustained demand for wood products in the future. Maybe we can cut down some trees, and plant new ones in their stead, then repeat as necessary as the market demands.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tree_farm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tree_farm</a>

            Unfortunately tree farms are absolutely disastrous when it comes to biodiversity, and biodiversity loss and climate change are not separate problems but deeply intertwined. You cannot solve one and ignore the other. Regular managed forest is better but not good either.

            Nature is the only one capturing CO2 at the moment.<p>Biodiversity is what nature does. It starts with soil, then small plants, and gradually you get trees. It&#x27;s very energy efficient, but it&#x27;s a very slow process.<p>Industrial monocultives are nothing like that. It&#x27;s much faster, but it works out of the paths nature has. Usually by emitting CO2 directly, which impacts climate change.<p>For example, the natural process of building the soil of a forest takes decades of tiny plants and animals living and pooping and dying, while artificial lumber forest soil is brought in trucks, and set in a single season, with fertilizer extracted from a mine (more CO2). The pooping and dying part releases some CO2 as well, but it cannot compare.<p>On top of that, cultivation tends to take land from wild forests and jungles. So that doubles the effect.<p>Permaculture is a way to produce food and wood products using methods that mimic what nature does. Give it a look if you are interested in these things.

            Your comment doesn&#x27;t make sense. A tree growing in a tree farm, and being turned into lumber will sequester that carbon until that lumber is burned. I suppose it matters if you&#x27;re talking about cutting down old growth for lumber, or using old farm land to put a tree farm on.

            Their comment is supposing that the energy costs of hauling the tree out of the forest and slicing it into boards &#x2F; mulch &#x2F; whatever (given our current logging technology) emits more carbon (from fuel usage and electricity generation) than the tree sequestered during it&#x27;s lifetime.<p>This probably not true, considering that for many decades steam powered logging equipment burned wood before coal became the dominant fuel source (and thus able to cut down and process a tree with less energy than we got from a single tree), although many mills were powered by flowing water.<p>It&#x27;s the same notion that &quot;PV panels emit an equivalent of 50g of CO2 per kW&#x2F;h (assuming a 25 year service life)&quot;. Even though the panel doesn&#x27;t emit anything during operation, mining and manufacturing are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels.<p>The tree itself sequesters carbon, but the carbon output from using the tree is what is produced burning it + getting it ready to burn.

            Have you watched the trucks hauling logged trees down the road? 
They aren&#x27;t exactly fuel efficient, then you haul that finished product from the mill to the lumber yard, then to the job site. The average tree sequesters 400kg of carbon in 25 years. The average commuter car will produce that in 2 weeks.

            Cultural issues are huge here.  Back in the 1980s high end construction made great use of tropical hardwoods which were considered premium materials that any proper wealthy person would prefer in their home.  By the mid to late 1990s there was a huge shift and wealthy people building custom homes started to request LEED certification instead which completely changed everything.  Out with the tropical hardwoods and in with reused barn beams.  And all through this time the argument focused on legalities when evidence was mounting that the tastes and preferences of the wealthy were what really made the difference.

            The use of tropical woods can basically be ignored in the discussion of deforestation.<p>1. When you harvest wood, the forest will generally recover and new trees will grow.<p>2. Lumber only accounts for about 2% of the total area deforested.<p>3. Agriculture accounts for 90+% of deforested area, most of this being for cattle or soy, and once land is converted to agriculture the change is generally permanent.

            These are good ideas, but the numbers are flatly unbelievable.  Until quite recently most tropical hardwood was harvested illegally and distributed through black markets.  This often involved either clear cutting or selective removal of rare trees or both.  There is very little if any hard information about exactly how much tropical deforestation in the 1980s involved lumber, though there has been significant progress in enforcement since then.

            I mean, follow the money. Why are those countries dumping chemicals, plastics in the ocean? Why are they cutting down forests and agriculturizing their land?<p>Mostly because the rich countries pay them to do it, basically. So they can build our toys and grow our beef. In other words, we export our environmental damage so we can <i>afford</i> to keep our environment cleaner.

            Sure, this should be part of the solution, but nuclear power doesn&#x27;t cost nothing, it&#x27;s either quite expensive or quite dangerous.<p>Also, this only answers the question of decarbonization of the electricity, which is maybe 25% of the problem. You still need to address transportation, heating, cooling, land use, meat consumption, etc. This is where people will need to change their ways of life, at least just a bit.

            It was much worse in the 1980s. There was serious concern back then that the Amazon would mostly be gone by now. But the deforestation rate has declined since then. It&#x27;s still far from ideal, and there was a recent surge. But it&#x27;s not apocalyptic.

            From what I know the damage to the Amazon rainforest is greater than ever. Some models seem to suggest that a savannah could be another stable state that the region could exist in. Fears are now that the area could undergo a rapid transition between these states because the decreasing rainforest coverage can no longer give rise to the weather patterns that help to sustain it.

            Well, it&#x27;s not greater than ever. It&#x27;s among the largest (not the largest) numbers on the current time series, that started at the late 90&#x27;s. It&#x27;s known that the entire series is much lower than the historic amounts, but the previous data is not precise enough to tell by how much.<p>The rest of your comment is spot on, but those fears have been there since the 70&#x27;s. Of course, as deforestation continues, we move closer and closer to that scenario, but nobody can tell if it&#x27;s actually any close. Anyway, systematic forest loss due to increased temperatures (and the weather changes they bring) is much more worrisome, since this one is already happening all around the world.

            No, it&#x27;s just that there is not as much forest that is as easily exploitable as there was in the 80s, so of course the rate has to go down.

            Plastic is cheaper by weight, lighter, easier to form and far more adjustable in appearance. It has a broader range of temperature responses, chemical responses, physical properties and textures. It is in general harder to break. In short, plastic excels because it is apparently cheap and useful and its dire costs, in particular of single use plastics and in particular to the commons, are - much like other systemic issues burgeoning under capitalism - never adequately accounted for.

            The whole save-the-trees movement did nothing for 98% of the world&#x27;s population, and the mass usage of plastics was propped up by companies switching to a cheaper and more efficient material, with no regard for consequences (because why would they?

            We don&#x27;t have to stop eating meat. Reducing consumption goes a long way already.<p>Here&#x27;s my story. I noticed that I was eating far more meat than I actually wanted to. It happened out of habit and because it was just there. That means I had been &quot;mindlessly&quot; buying meat while shopping instead of having a plan what to do with it. Once I stopped shopping like that, I found that I craved meat less often than I had expected. When I now do, I actually have meat and that without feeling bad at all. I consume far less meat than I used to, without actually missing anything. I consider that a success and one that is sustainable for me on top of that.

            I find it hard to fathom what are said to be average American meat consumption habits. They say it’s 4 pounds per week per person, but that’s just insane. Sometimes I buy half a pound of bacon and end up throwing half away a month later. I use half a pound of ground pork in a sauce that serves ten for dinner. I feel like I’d have to make a comedic effort to eat four pounds of meat in a week.

            Technically i think that bacon you throw away is considered part of your consumption.  I would be curious how much meat is wasted vs eaten.   It is still a large amount of meat but fascinated by the nuances.

            I 100% admit to consuming food that I waste. That&#x27;s on me! Half a pound is the least they sell.<p>What&#x27;s beyond me is just the top line, gross figure. I&#x27;d need to bring home 10-20 pounds of meat every week to conform to the average, which is unimaginable.

            I&#x27;ve been a vegetarian for a while now, but I remember visiting England at age 17 and at nearly every restaurant we visited, I would order a burger. Every place had a &quot;quarter pound beefburger&quot; or something like it on the menu, and I was there for it.<p>The greatest and most memorable was this one restaurant where one of the menu items was, as I recall, &quot;two half-pound beefburgers&quot;. When it showed up at the table my brother was astounded and my dad said something like &quot;He might share with the rest of us.&quot;<p>I did not. They had their own meals, and I had my pound of beef for lunch.<p>I&#x27;ve had to slow down a bit as I reach middle age, and I&#x27;ve been a vegetarian since 2003, but I probably eat around 4LBs of fake meat most weeks, not counting all the tofu.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying this isn&#x27;t absurd.

            And yet, deforestation rates have declined significantly over the past several decades globally despite added several billion people, while Europe and the US have been reforesting.<p>From the article:<p>&quot;As we explore in more detail in our related article, countries tend to follow a predictable development in forest cover, a U-shaped curve.5 They lose forests as populations grow and demand for agricultural land and fuel increases, but eventually they reach the so-called ‘forest transition point’ where they begin to regrow more forests than they lose.&quot;

            You might be surprised by the actual facts on this matter: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mongabay.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;whats-causing-deforestation-new-study-reveals-global-drivers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mongabay.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;whats-causing-deforestatio...</a><p>And in particular: &quot;The study found that clearing forests for oil palm plantations like the one above in Sabah, Malaysia, was the leading cause of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia during 2001 and 2015.&quot;<p>For North America, the major cause of deforestation was timber logging and forest fires.<p>The only place where cattle ranching has a major role in deforestation is in Brazil, and even in that case is not 90% of the cause as you imply above.

            You need to have a look at the numbers globally. And include all the deforestation done to clear space for growing soy beans (later used to feed farmed animals).<p>some sources below

            If you can avoid Nutella, you can avoid palm oil (it was tough for our family but we just don&#x27;t buy it).<p>Palm oil (and it&#x27;s derivatives like palm fruit oil, or palm solids) is infested throughout a lot of shelf-stable snacks.

            Nutella is the least of your issues.<p>&quot;Palm oil is the most consumed vegetable oil on the planet.&quot;<p>&quot;The food industry is responsible for 72% world wide usage of palm oil. Cosmetics and cleaning products are responsible for a further 18% usage whilst 10% globally is used for biofuels and animal feed.<p>In food, it&#x27;s the fat ingredient in things like biscuits and margarine. In soap and cosmetics, it’s used as a fat to increase the thickness or viscosity of a product and it helps skin to retain moisture.<p>Palm oil and its derivatives is often masked under 200 different names in ingredients lists. More obviously it may be listed as palm kernel, palmitic acid or even simply as vegetable oil. As of 2014, in the EU, food ingredient lists must list which type of vegetable oil they contain.&quot;<p>From: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ethicalconsumer.org&#x2F;food-drink&#x2F;palm-oil-what-it-used" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ethicalconsumer.org&#x2F;food-drink&#x2F;palm-oil-what-it-...</a><p>There are alternatives to Nutella that don&#x27;t use palm oil, so you don&#x27;t have to be tough on your family. But note that even if Nutella disappeared tomorrow, it wouldn&#x27;t make a dent on palm oil consumption.<p>Also, if you believe what Nutella has to say about their use of Palm Oil, you don&#x27;t have to feel bad for consuming it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nutella.com&#x2F;int&#x2F;en&#x2F;inside-nutella&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;palm-oil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nutella.com&#x2F;int&#x2F;en&#x2F;inside-nutella&#x2F;sustainability...</a>

            I&#x27;m not ready to become fully vegetarian. But I&#x27;d be curious what steps people have taken to reduce or change their meat consumption?<p>I&#x27;m thinking of only eating meat when going out to a nice restaurant, or for certain special meals (ie American Thanksgiving). But avoiding the commodity meat and being vegetarian as much as possible at home.

            I moved to Vietnam and became vegetarian when I realized that despite what Bourdain (rip) likes you to believe, cheap street food isn&#x27;t that good for you after all.<p>They don&#x27;t go through much effort to hide the source of meat. In fact, some places hang the meat out in the sun (and flies and dirt) for you to see it as you drive by.<p>Never mind that there is no quality control, animal welfare, USDA, sanitization, etc... Heck, the meat they serve you might not even be what they advertise. Plenty of dogs and cats roaming around. Don&#x27;t forget, right before covid, there was a mass swine flu going around where they slaughtered literally every single pig in the northern part of the country.<p>Anyway, I always cringe now when people try to tell me how good street food is... if you&#x27;ve seen some of the things I&#x27;ve seen... the decision is pretty easy.

            Try just adding some good side vegetables or salads to your ordinary dishes and you should be able to reduce the amount of meat and carbs in each meal.<p>You could also try to find one good vegetarian dish and cook that once in a while. Daal is my goto vegetarian dish that tastes good and is easy to make in large batches.

            The HN crowd does get their panties in a bunch when anyone mentions vegetarianism, population control, or anything related to Socialism.<p>You can&#x27;t have it all.  Well the very wealthy can, but you can&#x27;t.<p>Not eating meat would probally overnight stop the deforestation of the Amazon.  Plus you desk jockeys might live past 60 in decent health.

            &gt; Not eating meat would probally overnight stop the deforestation of the Amazon.<p>Unfortunately not. The Amazon would still get converted into farm land, but it would be even more palm oil instead of cattle.
