            HIV is incredibly sophisticated. It&#x27;s actually kind of amazing how effective it is. I mean obviously the resulting disease is bad, no question. You can still appreciate the sophistication.<p>HIV has resisted efforts to develop a vaccine for 30+ years at this point.<p>I am already beginning to wonder if the 2020s will be the story of the social transformation caused by mRNA vaccines. An effective and relatively cheap HIV vaccine will be huge.<p>Apart from Covid and HIV, mRNA is going to have a huge effect on the flu vaccine too. For anyone who doesn&#x27;t know, predictions are made about what flu strains will dominate the coming winter 4-6+ months ahead of time and the vaccine is made from that. Those predictions may not be accurate, which largely explains the variance of efficacy. mRNA has the potential to reduce that down to 1-2 months so you can potentially react to the actual dominant strains.<p>Cancer of course isn&#x27;t a single disease. Even something like lung cancer are a collection of different diseases. But some cancers are caused by viruses. A notable example is cervical cancer where it seems like most cases are caused by HPV strains. Australia is on track to essentially eliminate cervical cancer by 2035 [1]. To be clear, this isn&#x27;t an mRNA vaccine.<p>But mRNA vaccines may greatly reduce the time required to develop a vaccine and make it possible to eliminate whole classes of diseases.<p>This is all super-exciting.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vcs.org.au&#x2F;blog&#x2F;our-impact&#x2F;news&#x2F;australia-can-continue-to-pave-the-way-for-cervical-cancer-elimination&#x2F;#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20its,are%20down%20across%20the%20country" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vcs.org.au&#x2F;blog&#x2F;our-impact&#x2F;news&#x2F;australia-can-co...</a>.

            &gt; But some cancers are caused by viruses.<p>Note that mRNA technology is not limited to viruses. The cancer vaccine is actually a misnomer as it is actually a personalized treatment for people who already have cancer [1]:<p>&gt; The cells from the patient&#x27;s tumor are analyzed, and genetic sequencing is used to identify twenty neoantigen epitopes that may elicit the strongest immune response in the patient. The sequences encoding the twenty patient-specific epitopes are transcribed and loaded onto a single mRNA molecule. [...] This leads to an induction of both cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)- and memory T-cell-dependent immune responses that specifically target and destroy the patient&#x27;s cancer cells that express these neoantigens.<p>BioNTech has actually started Phase 2 trials for a mRNA-based cancer therapy [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cancer.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;dictionaries&#x2F;cancer-drug&#x2F;def&#x2F;mrna-based-personalized-cancer-vaccine-mrna-4157" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cancer.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;dictionaries&#x2F;cancer-drug...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clinicaltrialsarena.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;first-patient-dosed-in-biontech-phase-ii-trial-of-mrna-cancer-vaccine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clinicaltrialsarena.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;first-patient-dosed...</a>

            Building out the capacity to manufacture and distribute ten billion doses of new vaccines as quickly as we can validate their safety and efficacy would also be quite the feat.<p>It&#x27;s nice for a first-world citizen that we were getting vaccinated against a new disease 12-18 months after it was first discovered, but with a big enough supply chain we could potentially be aiming to <i>finish</i> a world-wide vaccination campaign in 6-12 months, before we begin running up against the limits of our current methodologies for clinical trials.

            Source for this, and the amount of time that we were only vaccinating women? If it was just a year or so, that&#x27;s a very different story from decades.<p>I recall there being a sudden, loud push 10ish years ago, for everyone to get the HPV vaccine.<p>There were some anti-vax arguments against it for the same reason as there&#x27;s resistance to sex ed; but no &quot;men can&#x27;t get cervical cancer&quot; arguments, that I recall.

            I think the tone I read implied into your post was that it was something malicious or arrogant. &quot;Don&#x27;t protect the men because they don&#x27;t need to care about giving it to women&quot;, followed by &quot;oh noes, men can get sick too!

            To me the &quot;coolest&quot; feature is that it saves dormant copies in cells, so that even if there is no detectable virus in the blood, a few months after stopping taking anti-HIV drugs the virus will reappear. If you sample the virus right when the first spike reappears, you will see a bunch of different HIV virus types, essentially the history of each mutation on that person, as each virus strain saves its own copies... (soon after the strongest strain dominates)

            A person with HIV will actually be infected by multiple variants simultaneously, since the virus mutates rapidly within a single host (tons of variants will be produced in a single day).  So, even though the immune system will fight the virus and produce antibodies, the virus stays one step ahead.  That also means that a person will not develop long-term immunity after being exposed to the live virus (and can even be infected multiple times with different variants and strains), and is the main challenge with developing an HIV vaccine.<p>I am no expert but my understanding is that AIDS occurs when a variant targeting receptors more specific to CD4 T-cells begins replicating (or begins replicating at too high a rate), which results in T-cell counts falling below some threshold.  So a person will go through an extended period without feeling any symptoms, possibly transmitting the virus to others (hence the importance of widespread, easy access to testing), only to be incapacitated by AIDS later when the &quot;balance&quot; of the variants changes (assuming they do not receive HIV-suppressing medications).

            &gt;I am already beginning to wonder if the 2020s will be the story of the social transformation caused by mRNA vaccines. An effective and relatively cheap HIV vaccine will be huge.<p>In the 90s, sure. Between treatment so effective that you can&#x27;t pass it on and PreP, the days of HIV is over anyway. Vactination might be a bigger deal in poor countries, but they are also the countries that can least afford it.<p>If they can cure HIV, that would be another thing.

            If the argument is that you can make mRNA vaccines faster, that would also tend to imply cheaper. Which could mean they can make it up on volume.

            If all mRNA have side effects like the current crop of COVID vaccines I’m honestly not sure they are worth it as a seasonal flu shot.<p>I’m not talking about the scare mongering of long term effects. Just the immediate.<p>The day after my second moderna shot was worse than any flu I can remember and many of my friends in their 20s and 30s had to take a day off after their shot. I know several people in their 60s who had to take several days to a week in bed from vaccine side effects.<p>That’s fine for ending a pandemic or curing HIV, but for seasonal flu?<p>In terms of lost labor days, my anec-data points to this vaccine seeming worse than a seasonal flu.

            I don&#x27;t know. The last time I had a seasonal flu, I was sick for a week. I cried because I needed to do laundry and simply didn&#x27;t have the energy and I ate poorly - I lived alone at the time. All of my energy went to surviving work.<p>Compared to having a sore arm for a couple of days? Or even getting sick for a day or two - at a time I can choose - to just not deal with getting sick later on? Sure. And I&#x27;m awfully sure that the flu kills more than the vaccine for it. So many complications for so many people.<p>And to be fair: The folks you knew in their 60&#x27;s had an unusual reaction. Older people with their aging immune systems are actually more likely to get little to know side effects to vaccines - younger folks tend to get more. The same goes for folks that are genetically female: You tend to get more side effects (they think this is because so many immune genes are on sex chromosomes, and women have more genes here.).<p>And to be fair: Taking a day off of work when you are sick isn&#x27;t such a big deal if you live somewhere with labor protection laws that allow you sick days. It is a little less of a big deal if you live in the US and get paid sick time, but a lot of folks just don&#x27;t have this so it makes being sick after a vaccine a bigger deal that it should be.

            The question is simple, does the benefit of using said vaccine or medication outweigh the risk of not using it. In the case of covid being sick for a couple of days and a guarantee of preventing future death is better than a resulting death had the user not taken it.<p>I would say a couple of days of flu is vastly better than some of the other side effects I&#x27;ve seen with other medications. Take for instance:<p>- Suicidal thoughts
- Abnormal heart rhythms
- Internal bleeding
- Cancer<p>At the end of the day, we rely on medical professionals to help us with these decisions and weigh the treatment of said ailments against the side effects we may incur if we do or don&#x27;t take treatment. For what it&#x27;s worth I&#x27;ve seen the opposite, most folks took the day off just in case there was a side effect, but ultimately everyone was fine. I know I scheduled my vaccine shots for a Thursday so I could have a 3 day weekend assuming I wasn&#x27;t feeling ill, and I felt fine so I enjoyed my 3 day weekend.

            Sometimes I find it a little depressing that (at least through my laymen eyes) we are nearing a technological plateau and that more research into physics is unlikely to get us to a world describe in traditional science fiction with FTL drives and large metal spaceships that can take you from planet to planet.<p>Then something like this reminds me that if we as a species were able to unlock the secrets of bio-chemistry (not sure if that&#x27;s the right term) it would be a game changer unlike any seen so far. And the fact that there is a huge corpus of evidence out there in the world called &quot;life&quot; proving some of the possibilities already gives me hope that while we may never have FTL, the future could still be pretty wild.

            I do want us to pour money into foundational research, but form an outsider&#x27;s perspective, it does seem like a lot of it does require increasingly large capital costs with things like the LHC, and feels all so theoretical.<p>I think it&#x27;s worth every penny, but at first glance it feels incredibly abstract and disconnected from practical application, as well as expensive. (Though, to be honest, I just looked up the LHC cost and $9Bn USD doesn&#x27;t feel expensive. I was expected it to come up in the hundreds of billions.)

            It depends on what you mean by &quot;understanding&quot;. We can explain using a specific set of rules how something works. It doesn&#x27;t mean that those rules are the best way to explain it or that they are even correct.<p>For example, we could explain that electricity works because of how electrons move, which would be correct from  our point of view, but if we find out that we were living in a simulation, then the explanation would be that this is how &quot;electricity&quot; was coded to behave.<p>Also, usually in physics a formula is thought to be correct until some new laws&#x2F;rules are found, then the formula is updated by adding some extra terms and then again thought to be correct.

            &gt;we are nearing a technological plateau and that more research into physics is unlikely to get us to a world describe in traditional science fiction with FTL drives and large metal spaceships that can take you from planet to planet.<p>strange to me how nobody questions why beavers only make damns a certain size, birds only make nests and don&#x27;t go beyond that in complexity.<p>So many people seem blind to the idea that humans might be near their intellectual limit as a species and assume we will just keep progressing technologically. For all we know it&#x27;s possible we hit a brick wall in terms of progress. Average human struggles with calculus, what if there was a species that could do advanced math as easily as we do 2 + 2?<p>Seems the limit for human advancement is tied to rate of learning, life span, and general cognitive ability. If you want more advanced tech you need to focus on those problems

            I&#x27;ve often wondered about this. My suspicion is that there is a limit to the complexity of mental models that humans can fluently manipulate and I think we&#x27;re starting to bump into it in some cases.<p>I think we will eventually need a paradigm shift from science being built around human grokable models (e=mc^2) to external human manipulatable models (ie, large scale machine derived models that we can&#x27;t actually grok but can use for analysis and engineering). I think we&#x27;re already starting to see this - there are already mathematical proofs that are so large and complex (in the GB range) that they had to be found by automation and only other automation can verify them.

Basically, building anything more than a minimally-viable nest or a dam requires using energy that could be invested elsewhere to greater evolutionary advantage.<p>Humans have gone beyond because for as long as we can remember, we&#x27;ve always had vast, vast surpluses of energy, initially through the cooking of meat and agriculture, then via animal labour, and then finally via fossil fuels.

            I love the analogy, but I think it flawed: the limits are practical and excess just adds risk.<p>On the flip side, nothing seems more exemplified by humanity than a zeal for doing a thing as big and grandiose as possible: for curiosity, for business, for art, or just for sheer vanity.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve seen how far those will take us yet, even w&#x2F;o improvements to the bottlenecks you suggest.

            I normally buy into this sort of logic, but there&#x27;s a fundamental difference. We experience the world in a way that recognizes beavers&#x27; and birds&#x27; limits, whereas they do not.  We can modify ourselves and our environment in a way and changes our limits.  Perhaps if the world is a simulation, then there are hard limits, as we are but bits in a computer so to speak, but even then it&#x27;s not certain - we could become aware of the world outside the simulation and learn to manipulate it thought I&#x2F;O mechanisms.

            You can teach smart (not average) 12 year olds the basic rules how to compute derivation or primitive function, but I doubt they are capable of distinguishing between, say, continuous and uniformly continuous function.

            Solar has dropped 50-75% in cost in the last decade, and accounts for 10x more wattage. Battery capacity has doubled in that time. Wind energy capacity has doubled. Geothermal capacity is 1.5x. Electric cars are 4x more common than they were 5 years ago. Carbon sequestration has advanced at a technological level, although production hasn&#x27;t seen serious advances (probably because renewable energy produces a profitable resource, while sequestering just exchanges money for fighting climate change).<p>If that&#x27;s not enough to make a difference, it&#x27;s because we started too late and the problem is too large, not because technological development is too slow. Admittedly, nuclear could have done the job already, and the issue there is social.<p>If human lifespan technology moved at half the climate change technology speed, we&#x27;d have 25 extra years per decade and be effectively immortal today.

            Food can be recycled pretty effectively, and if were that good at biotech I assume we could improve on the current state of the art.<p>They already recycle water very effectively on the ISS. It&#x27;s the machine that &quot;turns yesterday&#x27;s coffee into today&#x27;s coffee.&quot;<p>Of course if we were that good at biotech we could probably hibernate a good chunk of the flight time too. Might be necessary to wake up periodically to reset the body, but you could probably hibernate most of the duration. Maybe you&#x27;d do it with some kind of weird circadian cycle with extremely elongated sleep periods, sleeping like 10X-100X as long as you are awake. During each wake period you check to make sure everything is working properly.<p>You would not need a Bussard ramjet for the long duration flights I&#x27;m thinking of. A nuclear thermal rocket could get you a good deal past solar system escape velocity. Nuclear pulse propulsion could get you up to at least single digit percentages of the speed of light if you didn&#x27;t mind a little boom-boom. Then you just cruse along on an interstellar transfer orbit until you do a retro-burn to enter the destination star system a few tens of thousands of years later. These are all technologies that are already feasible at least on paper. No new physics is needed.

            In practice this is what we observe, but the combinatorics are so ridiculously large that its hard to understand how it works.  A very small protein of say 200 amino acid residues has 21^200 configurations.  If every atom in the universe was another universe, and every atom in those universes was a universe, you&#x27;d still need 10^20 grandpappy universes to represent each configuration as a distinct atom in the grandchild universe.  Given that these configurations confer meaningful chemical and mechanical utility, sometimes with discontinuities in effect, it&#x27;s really odd to me that it all somehow works.

            Caused by the initial shock of AIDS, and ongoing activism, there has been consistent funding from federal and various private sources in development. Thanks to these efforts, antiretrovirals are widely available, making AIDS a &quot;solved&quot; problem in the sense that you can prevent AIDS onset indefinitely with the right medication.<p>Right now, the problem is more about actually accessing the people who might have HIV, getting them to test themselves regularly, and then giving them access to HIV medication if they are positive. Often these people are on the fringes of society. A vaccine would be an ideal tool to reach these people than asking them to get tested regularly.<p>HIV is a way harder virus to develop a vaccine for than SARS-CoV-2. For starters, once you have it, HIV is way more dangerous. Most people with covid don&#x27;t need medical attention at all, they can deal with it themselves. Meanwhile, someone infected with HIV is basically sentenced to death in a couple of years if they aren&#x27;t medicated (&gt;90% mortality rate). The current covid pandemic is so severe because covid spreads so much better than HIV does. Our immune system can&#x27;t really deal with HIV in a way that we survive the encounter. With SARS-CoV-2 you only need to slightly nudge the immune system into the right direction. That&#x27;s a way easier task.<p>HIV also has an immensely large mutation rate. The genetic diversity in a single individual is larger than the genetic diversity of one entire yearly influenza outbreak. So you need to come up with defenses that help against a gigantic set of HIV viruses. We still need to vaccinate people yearly with an influenza shot, because we can&#x27;t create universal influenza vaccines yet. It&#x27;s an open problem similar to how a HIV vaccine is an open problem.<p>TLDR: There is already something like warp speed for HIV, but we were mostly lucky that it was so easy to come up with a covid vaccine.

            Yeah, HAART is not side effect free, but one has come a long way from the initial retrovirals which had way more severe side effects.<p>As for the CD4+ T cells, you are right that their numbers decrease before it&#x27;s called AIDS.

            The history of HIV research has had a lot of valiant work. We have had several vaccine attempts in the past, that have all been unsuccessful.<p>And despite President-level dismissal of HIV&#x2F;AIDS at the time, significant resources were devoted to it in the 80s, such that even though we didn&#x27;t make huge progress against HIV at the time, the research on HIV progressed the rest of the field.<p>And a lot of our anti-viral drugs have come out of HIV research as well.<p>A modern Project Warpspeed probably wouldn&#x27;t be quite as successful as a Covid19 Warpspeed, because a lot of the first ideas have already been attempted. But with the new sorts of designs that mRNA vaccines allow, there&#x27;s a lot more that&#x27;s possible now.

            Most won&#x27;t be.  HIV spreads by things that most in congress are unlikely to take part in. (sharing needles).

            For the most part our blood supply has good protection for blood born illness (between rules that prevent the high risk from donating and testing).  That wasn&#x27;t always the case.  It is best to keep the mistakes of the past un talked about so that we don&#x27;t spread fear of the blood supply which would kill far more people.

            Good luck finding anything that still seems &quot;simple&quot; when you really look towards understanding how it works rather than what it results in. Simple and complex always have to be relative to other things as nothing is absolutely &quot;simple&quot; e.g. even a single atom is an extraordinarily complicated environment which spans many textbooks and degrees worth of interactions and understandings. To say everything is just complex to more super duper extra complex is to just replace the sound of &quot;simple&quot; with the sound of &quot;complex&quot; yet have it mean the exact same thing and use it in the exact same way.

            I came here to say make this (lonely) comment. HIV and CoV are very different viruses. Different pathogenesis, different tropism, different social drivers for transmission...  
mRNA technology did well in 2020, but it was a very well-funded technology in clinical development for ~10 years before SARS-CoV2 arrived. HIV and Cancer are not low-hanging fruit. I wish them the best, as I hate both those diseases, but I&#x27;m not aware that there is anything in the technology that uniquely provides a solution to the problem.

            from what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s not really mRNA that gives Moderna any advantage, as much as being able to raise broadly-neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) against HIV membrane protein.<p>but.. it&#x27;s still not a polyvalent vaccine, it&#x27;s only targeting one such highly-conserved region, and there&#x27;s HIV out there that evades BNAbs (5% of HIV+ patients have BNAbs after all, and they eventually progress.. though maybe after changing tropism or something.)<p>so it may not be all that effective as a strategy, but there&#x27;s at least some monkey data suggesting it delays or sometimes prevents infection.<p>More info here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aidsmap.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;mar-2020&#x2F;hiv-vaccine-generates-broadly-neutralising-antibodies-passes-first-safety-and-proof" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aidsmap.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;mar-2020&#x2F;hiv-vaccine-generates-...</a>

            These aren&#x27;t really the questions to be asked when they just started with a first trial.<p>If it&#x27;s 99% effective and has close to zero sideeffects that&#x27;s very different from 60% effective and significant sideeffects.

            No, the point is that you could probably extinguish HIV with a very low vaccination rate - if the vaccination rate in the at-risk population is high enough.<p>&quot;Anybody taking the vaccine&quot; (not &quot;everybody&quot;) will actually not eradicate the virus, but rather protect those who take the vaccine.

            The prophylactics should not affect clinical trials a lot. Obviously the organizers need to track who also takes prophylactics. It would be unethical to only enroll participants (especially those at higher risk) who don&#x27;t take prophylactics because they could get the placebo and then they have zero protection.<p>Everything else is just a question of the statistical signal detection. Those Studies are planned and designed to provide such a signal, with all we know about HIV prevalence (which is already quite low, in most industrial countries, speaking statistically and for the overall population) and the effectiveness of prophylactic treatment.<p>Also what I&#x27;m hearing the prophylactic treatment is not much fun either... I rather see the danger of participants getting the placebo, drop the prophylactics and think they are protected...

            It&#x27;s tricky, because between condoms, PREP and PEP (pre- and post-exposure drugs) and treatments now being good enough that life expectancy with HIV is nearly the same as without, it&#x27;d take very low risks of side effects before giving it to everyone would cause more harm than not giving it.<p>So the safety profile will be hugely important in determining how widely to use it.

            No vaccine is 100% effective. No medicine seems to be 100% effective either. This is a known issue, and it always has been.

            I think marketingwise the vaccine will have a very, very hard time against PrEP, unless it can be proven that it&#x27;s just as effective. And what about booster shots? It would be highly unethical to give someone an experimental vaccine INSTEAD of just PrEP. But if we don&#x27;t do that, we can never find out how good the vaccine works. A dilemma.

            To be clear, Truvada (or Descovy) for vast majority of people will have essentially no side effects. There is a small increase in chance of kidney disease, mainly for those with other risk factors, the risk profile is similar to over the counter ibuprofen.<p>&quot;HIV-positive individuals who use Truvada to control their infection are more likely to experience kidney damage and bone density loss than those who take it to prevent HIV infection, as so-called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)[2]. But “no significant health effects have been seen in people who are HIV-negative and have taken PrEP for up to 5 years,” according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Numerous studies have shown that the risk of HIV-negative Truvada users developing kidney disease is not statistically significantly different from those taking placebo[3].&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthfeedback.org&#x2F;claimreview&#x2F;hiv-drug-truvada-linked-to-kidney-damage-and-bone-density-loss-but-risks-are-low-and-usually-outweighed-by-the-drugs-benefits&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthfeedback.org&#x2F;claimreview&#x2F;hiv-drug-truvada-link...</a>

            Unpopular opinion but Africa also desperately needs to fix the root cause of its HIV spread. Maybe this vaccine would give some relief and give them a chance to start over, but if there is a rampant culture of rape&#x2F;unprotected sex with many partners the same region will just get ravaged by the next STD and stick them back in the same rut.

            Yikes.  This is actually a field that I do research in, and this analysis just really, really doesn&#x27;t hold water.  Of course there are sociological contributors to the spread of HIV  on the African continent.  But the idea that there&#x27;s a &quot;culture of rape&quot; is pretty far off base, if only because Africa is an incredibly diverse continent so there&#x27;s not a shared culture of pretty much anything.  For a much more accurate look at the development of the AIDS pandemic in Africa, I recommend Jacques Pépin, The Origin of AIDS.

            Yeah, I probably could have phrased my original comment better. I didn&#x27;t mean to imply the areas in Africa with HIV issues have a culture of rape. I said &quot;<i>if</i> there is a rampant culture of rape&#x2F;unprotected sex with many partners the same region will just get ravaged by the next STD and stick them back in the same rut.&quot; (emphasis added).<p>My point being, if we have a magic pill that cures them of a given STD, but there are underlying cultural problems that contribute to elevated STD transmission (such as unprotected sex or rape), etc., then the magic pill is only a bandaid that doesn&#x27;t address the underlying elevated STD transmission problem.<p>As a sibling comment stated, maybe the problem is that these Africans believe homeopathic cures like special tea leaves will protect them from HIV when in reality they are just all having unprotected sex, so it&#x27;s both a cultural and educational issue.

            Double yikes to &quot;these Africans.&quot;  Pretty sure misplaced belief in homeopathy is not a distinctively African phenomenon.<p>But to the point: the major driver of the early explosion of HIV on the continent was almost certainly large-scale vaccination and medical treatment campaigns by colonial governments, which injected staggering numbers of people in rural areas without adequate disinfection of needles.<p>In the present, the sociological drivers of HIV spread do include rates of nonconsensual sex (particularly between teen girls and older men).  More important factors, however, are historical and contemporary patterns of urban&#x2F;rural migration and long-distance transit networks.  The distinctive forms of cyclical migration created by the shape of the mining industry in apartheid South Africa are the largest reason that the pandemic is so much worse in that region than anywhere else on the continent.<p>Research is pretty clear that Africans understand that condoms work to prevent HIV transmission - there have now been decades of public education campaigns on the subject.  That doesn&#x27;t mean they are always used, of course, but it&#x27;s not a knowledge problem.

Chief among these are the traditionally liberal attitudes espoused by many communities inhabiting the subcontinent toward multiple sexual partners and pre-marital and outside marriage sexual activity.&quot; and don&#x27;t mention anything about migration patterns being the more important factors.<p>So if this is actually your field of study, it would be helpful if the wikipedia article were updated with the latest research.

            It&#x27;s okay, everyone expresses an ignorant opinion at some point. We aren&#x27;t born knowing everything and we have to keep learning as the world changes.

            &gt;But to the point: the major driver of the early explosion of HIV on the continent was almost certainly large-scale vaccination and medical treatment campaigns by colonial governments, which injected staggering numbers of people in rural areas without adequate disinfection of needles.<p>Colonial governments were mostly out of Africa after the 1960s.<p>&gt;In the present, the sociological drivers of HIV spread do include rates of nonconsensual sex (particularly between teen girls and older men). More important factors, however, are historical and contemporary patterns of urban&#x2F;rural migration and long-distance transit networks. The distinctive forms of cyclical migration created by the shape of the mining industry in apartheid South Africa are the largest reason that the pandemic is so much worse in that region than anywhere else on the continent.<p>That&#x27;s being very disingenuous. What makes periodic migration by miners in South Africa different from large-scale worker migrations elsewhere in the world? Mexican farm workers to the US, half of China, or for that matter Canadian, Russian, and Australian miners, or oil-rig workers everywhere. It&#x27;s not so much the migration patterns, but what the migrants do (or don&#x27;t do) when &quot;back home&quot;.

            I think a bigger issue that would need to be addressed is the distrust of Western medicine, the beliefs that they know how to prevent HIV, that HIV was caused by the West in order to kill them, and the belief that they already know the cure of HIV.<p>There are parallels between the disinformation in the anti-vax Covid community, and the disinformation in regards HIV in Africa.

            HIV transmission is 18 times more likely with receptive anal sex than with receptive vaginal sex and 69% of the HIV positive people in the USA are active gay men.<p>So yes, being a homosexual man is a huge risk factor and probably more significant than being in an open relationship, cheating on your partner or performing unprotected sex unless you live in Sub-Saharan Africa.

            From personal experience, anal sex is definitely not limited to sex between men. I&#x27;m going to guess that there are entire websites dedicated to that, and there are definitely sections of porn websites dedicated to it. Additionally, sex between men encompasses much more than anal sex.<p>Which all goes back to teh point: HIV transmission isn&#x27;t related to sexual orientation, <i>even if</i> some sex acts are traditionally attributed to one specific sort of orientation.

            The argument you are addressing is a strawman. Nobody claimed that anal sex is limited only to sex between men. Anal sex is, however, far more common in frequency among homosexual men than between heterosexual couples, and significantly increases the risk of HIV transmission compared to vaginal sex, therefore it is a risk factor that is strongly correlated with sexual orientation.

            That&#x27;s a bit misleading. Attraction doesn&#x27;t change the risk but certain types of activities (anal sex) are significantly more prone to bleeding which drastically increases spread rate.

            As a male who is bisexual, this isn’t true. Transmitting hiv via unprotected vaginal sex is actually pretty rare, something like 1&#x2F;1000 or under. And gay&#x2F;bi men also tend to be more promiscuous. But of course a straight male and woman could do anal sex and that would be the same risk rate that gay men have, which is higher.

            I will tell you at right now even if it has a recommendation for all people many will not in first world. HIV still is &quot;gay disease&quot; to most thinking and many will not want to admit risk of getting it. This is largest problem to solve if you are wanting to remove HIV from population.

            As with any preventative medicine it boils down to risk&#x2F;benefit and (unfortunately) economics.  FDA approval process should expose most of the risk&#x2F;benefit equation and the manufacturer will set the price.  When all of that is said and done you will have a lot more information with which to consider your question.

            Former HIV researcher here.<p>Right now, HIV is a manageable condition, but ONLY because of the availability of drugs which suppress the virus. The virus eventually learns how to get around the drugs, at which point the patient either switches drugs or dies in a few years.<p>Without drugs, HIV is (near) 100% fatal. And since it takes a few years to kill, infected people have plenty of time to pass it on. Which they do.<p>Also, the first HIV infection feels like a minor cold. Most people would not even know they were HIV positive (until their immune system collapsed), were it not for lab testing.<p>Then just apply some basic epidemiology to these facts, and you see that you have a disease which has the potential to infect (and thus kill) a sizeable percent of the population. As in double-digit percentages.

            I don&#x27;t think the GP comment was being that specific. An HIV vaccine would be huge, but the fundamental research that was necessary to get to the point of a viable vaccine (pending successful trials, obviously) would pay dividends far beyond just HIV.

            &gt; If anything, such a development would enable a greater proliferation of other dangerous pathogens.<p>No, it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily.<p>While it&#x27;s true that a vaccine would apply selection pressure and create a fitness gradient for HIV to evolve against, the virus is still bound by its genetics.<p>The rate at which we&#x27;re developing vaccines is increasing dramatically. If our new methods are good enough to quickly adapt, then HIV may have a limited state space left to explore. A single remarkable vaccine could even do this on its own if we&#x27;re lucky.<p>The virus can&#x27;t easily descend down a fitness well to make a jump to a new gradient (ie. dramatic change of receptor bindings).<p>If you&#x27;re talking about novel viruses, that&#x27;s a wholly unrelated issue. There&#x27;s of course a giant reservoir of zoonotic viruses that may one day make a leap to humans, but if anything, our work to rapidly develop vaccines may give us an increased advantage against new viruses if and when they arise.<p>Finally, if you&#x27;re talking &quot;hygiene hypothesis&quot;, that under-stimulation of the immune system creates auto immune disorders, has increased interaction with gut flora, or changes the dynamics with which cancer clearance happens, then you may be onto something. But this is a huge unknown where we have a lot of study left to do.<p>(On a personal note, I left my pursuit of biochem because when I studied it, the prospects looked to be moving at glacial pace and the tools felt akin to using punch cards and truth tables. The problems are massive, dynamical, and it looked too daunting. After the last decade and a half of bio discoveries and innovations, I&#x27;ve changed my outlook completely and am incredibly bullish on biotech. We are going to make incredible strides in the next few decades that will in many ways mirror the rise of tech. I want to find my way back to the field someday.)

            Bioengineering can have its own negative externalities, and in practice incentives may misalign in such a way that we solve an immediate problem but also create a new one that will manifest later and hence someone else will have to deal with it.

Of course you cannot live through the gamma blast area, but surely the fallout zones may be manageable.<p>On the other hand chemistry is highly temperature sensitive and at some point proteins will just denature. Then again you cannot have rapid growth without water, as plants need evaporation to transport minerals and such from the soil into the plant. And what about phosphorus anyway? Soon most soils may be nothing but dirt. You cannot work around the phosphorus erosion. Once it&#x27;s lost, it&#x27;s lost. We better start recycling our feces and the dead now. You kinda need to harden all life, not just humans and crops.

            my understanding is that by itself global warming won&#x27;t kill a large proportion of humans (heat waves and extreme weather events).  it&#x27;s the famine that will get us.  That will lead, inevitably, to war.

            AIDS killed a million people in 2016.  HIV medications help only when taken diligently, which is actually problematic even in developed countries where the most advanced treatments are available, and is much more difficult in poorer countries.  Even with treatment HIV infections are a burden on people, interfering with normal adult activities like sex (convincing people to use condoms is a challenge) and having children.<p>To quote Seven of Nine, survival is insufficient.  We could survive without a vaccine or a treatment, it would mean tens of thousands of years and billions of people dying from AIDS until our species adapts and HIV becomes just another retrovirus (as some other primate species have with related SIV viruses).  We should aim higher than &quot;survival&quot; and end the suffering caused by HIV, and with a vaccine we could do so in this century.

This is similar to the arguments about the space program being an expensive and largely irrelevant exercise even though all sorts of critical technology for weather satellites, solar power, electronic communications and so on came more or less directly from exploration and development of space.

            &gt; In America and world both, AIDS is small fries for death cause.<p>The <i>critical</i> distinction is outcomes: until relatively recently, the only outcome of an HIV infection was eventual death from AIDS. This is <i>still</i> the default outcome in most of the world.<p>Plenty of things kill more people than AIDS, but most of them have <i>substantially</i> less severe individual outcomes: many people survive them, or the social&#x2F;political solutions are <i>substantially</i> more tenable (healthier eating, access to potable water). And that&#x27;s even before we consider how AIDS research has advanced the field of medical virology as a whole.

            Helpful is an understatement, it would be life changing for many worldwide. Therapy and prevention measures exist but they&#x27;re still not available to everyone and can be a significant financial cost, even with insurance. For some, it&#x27;s still not an affordable option. Mutations and resistance also still occur and although life has been extended significantly, it&#x27;s still a lingering health issue that requires careful professional monitoring and treatment.<p>The assumption is that a vaccine would be long lasting, preventative, and likely cheaper if not cheap. That&#x27;s not only a significant improvement in quality of life in developed countries, that&#x27;s truly life changing&#x2F;giving if available in less developed countries. The COVID vaccines and potentially this are examples of capitalism done right.

            Because of the way HIV &quot;works&quot; any preventative vaccine would almost certainly be curative or as good as.<p>The HI virus is very slow (not called &quot;Lentivirus&quot; for nothing) and invests itself in the very stemcells of the cells that would be fighting it. This means it can hide from the immune system, and even the antiviral drugs can only push it back. But by the same token, if it is pushed back into the deepest refuge, it can&#x27;t really &quot;flood&quot; back into the rest of the body, it has to do so at a a trickle.<p>If there is a viable vaccine around, even if the virus manages to hide from total extinction in a host at first, it will get squashed whenever it tries to come back into the &quot;light&quot; of the immune system.<p>At least I hope it will work that way...

            I&#x27;m a bit confused since HIV works by disabling the immune system, and a vaccine works by priming the immune system.<p>So... if HIV has already damaged your immune system, can it take advantage of the vaccine?<p>Perhaps figuring out that is what the tests are for.

            You are confusing HIV infection and AIDS. The former is the virus, the latter is the end-stage disease.<p>It takes the virus years to reach the viral loads necessary to damage the immune system to a noticeable degree. Sure, HIV has some tricks before that point, but patients are generally not immunocompromised until AIDS enters the picture.

            Actually the immune system does fight HIV during the acute infection stage after a person is first exposed, and antibodies are generated.  The immune response to HIV is what does most of the damage to the immune system, since a typical immune response to virus infection involves the destruction of infected cells.  HIV infects certain immune cells, which will either self-destruct when the infection is detected or will be destroyed by other immune cells.

            Also, some people actually develop the so called &quot;broadly neutralizing antibodies&quot; and become immune to AIDs as a consequence.<p>There have even be experimental treatments where HIV infected patients who also got Leukemia got treated with radiation, and then a stemcell donation from someone with such an immunity. And they are indeed cured (for practical purposes, there are some details...). Unfortunately, those donors are rare and the radiation therapy etc is probably worse than the chronic antiviral therapy, which is why this is not a more common treatment for HIV.<p>Of course, inducing these particular antibodies has been the goal of various immunization efforts. Unfortunately this proved more challenging than it might seem.

            &gt;It&#x27;s still a death sentence in Africa (as is being gay).<p>Just to be somewhat anal, AIDS is much more common in Southern Africa, where homosexuality is generally either legal or the laws against it weak and unenforced.<p>It&#x27;s also much more correlated with race than sexuality.  In South Africa, it affects something like 15% of blacks vs 0.3% of whites.  Women are also far more likely to have HIV, especially younger ones.  I think it&#x27;s around 30% for pregnant women.<p>Outside of the West, AIDS is definitely not something that mainly gay men get.

            Some of us don’t think it’s normal, nor do we want to put up with it. Fully 60% of the voting population is deeply invested in seeing their team win regardless of what policies they support. We have to fight both democrats and republicans to make any progress. It’s a tough row to hoe.

            Fair enough.  I took the other guy at his word when he said it was $20k.  It&#x27;s definitely not uncommon for pharmaceuticals to cost an order of magnitude (or two) more in the US compared to other countries.

            There are two relatively straightforward things you can do that will help the situation: (a) vote, and (b) campaign to move to get some form of proportional representation become the voting system in your state, both for statewide and national elections.<p>A major reason why you&#x27;ve entrenched interests is that they have safe seats they can depend on. The US has major issues with acts of gerrymandering that create those safe seats. Most forms of PR are much more resistant to gerrymandering than FPTP is. And if you want people who&#x27;ll do something regarding healthcare costs, you need to get rid of those safe seats and make them accountable.

            At least in Belgium (where there are several generics available besides the &#x27;brand&#x27; Truvada), my out of pocket cost is 5 euro for a month&#x27;s supply.<p>If you take PrEP periodically (2+1+1) that will even last you a lot longer (depending on the frequency of course). 
I am very glad PrEP exists, and already optimistic about its impact in reducing transmissions. But if we can replace this with a one-shot vaccine, that would be groundbreaking.

            It&#x27;s not going to be a one-shot vaccine. The least I would think have even the possibility of working is six initial shots (not all the same) given on a very strict schedule, followed by a booster every six months. I would not be surprised if it was twice that for something that actually worked.

            It wouldn&#x27;t. Their immune system already has a sample of the virus.

            This is somewhat incorrect. Not all vaccines include a sample of the virus they&#x27;re protecting against (see the mRNA vaccines for covid-19).<p>Also for some viruses (again see covid-19), it&#x27;s still advisable to get a vaccine even if you&#x27;ve already been infected. The protection rate and longevity of the vaccines can outweigh infection based antibodies dramatically.<p>In the case of HIV, it&#x27;s potentially quite different, because HIV is such a unique disease, that yeah, a vaccine might not help anyway.

            Vaccine for coronavirus recommended for its immune-building benefit even in persons who had infection, this is to reduce likelihood for more infection in the future. I am doubting that this applys on the HIV since nobody is getting it then beating the infection, just supressing it.

            It probably is not really doing anything, I would think replacing the nocebo of being infected (or supposedly being infected) by SARS-CoV-2 in the past with the placebo of getting vaccinated (more recently, so you get a recency bias boost) makes up most of the &quot;helping&quot;.

Any vaccine effective would need to make the body see a pattern it cannot find on it&#x27;s own. Something universal to HIV, which cannot be evolved around.<p>This is different from other disease where the immune system doesn&#x27;t have enough time to response before the disease kills&#x2F;damages the body.<p>If the vaccine can prevent HIV signature evasion, it may very well help control&#x2F;treat the disease, I think.

            Depends on the vaccine. There are research programs to develop vaccines that induce people to make broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies. Most people don’t naturally produce these.  Such a vaccine could plausibly help people who are already infected.

            Thank goodness. I’m happy PrEP exists, but it gave me intense nausea for weeks before I couldn’t do it anymore. I would love to be able to date and not have to worry about HIV (I’m a trans woman who dates men, most of whom are bisexual). Not having to take another horse pill daily would be great too.

            Condoms take away 50% of the pleasure so I&#x27;d understand anyone who, in heat of the moment, would judge poorly and do it unprotected. Also, while rare, condoms, do break.<p>I&#x27;d say, from sexual perspective, the better protection is to have a long term partner (not talking about marriage here).<p>Also you can get HIV from other sources than sexual intercourse too, so having a vaccine that is proved by medical science is a huge relief.<p>Here is personal story of mine: Last year, while vacationing, I was walking on the beach and I felt a slight sting and when I looked down a hypodermic needle was piercing my finger. Took it up and barely a single drop of blood formed, so the penetration barely went below the skin but that was enough to make me feel afraid. After 3 weeks took the test, found out I was HIV negative and talked with the doctor. She said that salty water is great at dismantling DNA&#x2F;RNA and asked me what the needle looked like. It was all clean except for the tip where my blood was. Told me to not worry, just test again in 6 months which I did and for my great relief I was still HIV negative. Nevertheless during this entire time, in the back of my head black thoughts were daily there, worrying about &quot;what if&quot;.

            &gt; Moderna is seeking 56 individuals, aged 18 to 50 and who are HIV-negative, for the trial, which is estimated to begin on August 19 and conclude in spring 2023.<p>Probably a dumb question given that I have little domain knowledge here, but are they really going to get valuable data from 56 individuals? Like, isn&#x27;t that N really small? How many of them would be expected to contract HIV?<p>And, I&#x27;d imagine that if they are selecting a high-risk population for the trials (e.g., sexually active young gay men), wouldn&#x27;t a lot of the individuals already be on PREP? Would they have to go off of PREP, and run a potentially much greater risk of contracting HIV if the vaccine doesn&#x27;t actually work?

            People seem overly optimistic then.
Phase 1 trials are only used to test the safety of the drug, nothing else. Not sure why they plan to take such a long time for this initial phase. Covid was just a couple of weeks.<p>If the initial stage is already 2 years, I don&#x27;t see a Phase 3 trial taking less than 3 times that amount of time. It will be super difficult to test.

            Two half-baked comments off the top of my head:
-HIV targets, infects and cripples the immune system. While CoV2 infects and replicated aggressively, causing inflammation and fibrosis, HIV goes in, gets a foothold, hides and lingers like an insurgent, slowly exhausting the immune system. Very different approaches and how they are impacted by vaccines may be very different.<p>-Convincing people to take the vaccine would be hard. Look how hard it is with a respiratory pandemic. It&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; to be non-high risk for HIV and people probably believe they can&#x27;t get it, but people seem to continue getting it.

            No, you give it to 10k people, and give a placebo to another 10k, and let them live their lives, and after 5 years or so you see how many of each group have contracted HIV.

            The participants can have unprotected sex with HIV+ people if they want. It’s like the COVID-19 vaccine trials. The study designers didn’t set any parameters around mask use, social distancing, etc. It’s up to each participant to apply harm reduction practices as they see fit.

            Depends where you sample from.<p>In the USA, estimated new HIV infections in 2019 35k. Assuming 350 million Americans, that gives a very rough estimate of 1 case out of 10,000 per year.<p>You can enrich this by shifting target population. You could do this in the USA by targetting high risk communities, or by moving the trial overseas.<p>An trial in the USA with 10k in each arm could very likely be constructed to generate at least 10 cases per year. Likely up to 50.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hiv.gov&#x2F;hiv-basics&#x2F;overview&#x2F;data-and-trends&#x2F;statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hiv.gov&#x2F;hiv-basics&#x2F;overview&#x2F;data-and-trends&#x2F;stat...</a>

            Yeah, it&#x27;s a phase 1 trial. In phase 1 they aren&#x27;t even really  looking at if the vaccine is effective, they&#x27;re making sure that it&#x27;s safe&#x2F;side effects are reasonable, and maybe getting some dosage information out of it.

            HIV&#x2F;AIDs is a perfect example of why it&#x27;s dangerous to not distinguish between the two. If you are vaccinated and exposed to SARS-COV-2, you still have a high risk of infection, but because of the vaccine, you have a low risk of that infection developing into the disease known as COVID-19.<p>If a successful mRNA vaccine is developed to prevent AIDs, it would be extremely important for the vaccinated to know they can still be infected with and spread HIV. It&#x27;s not any different for SARS-COV-2&#x2F;COVID-19. The talk in this thread about an mRNA vaccine eradicating HIV is nonsense.

            Not sure exactly what you mean with social conservatism, but I&#x27;d rather call out misplaced optimism.<p>In the past the approch was to only target young girls before they had sex for the first time, which turned out to not reduce the spread of HPV as much as hoped. Only in recent years the recommendation changed to also vaccinate boys and increasingly also people with previous sexual encounters.

            Although true to a certain extent, it doesn&#x27;t mean minds can&#x27;t be changed, just as it is for any other population&#x27;s negative perception of any vaccine. In my own church I&#x27;ve had this discussion with parents, and I know of at least one who changed their position on HPV vaccination. I credit them with giving the matter thought.

            There was a lot of hoopla at the time the vaccine was announced, but other than that I&#x27;m not sure where you are getting your information?  HPV vaccination rates are increasing, and there is almost no resistance at this point.  The US vaccination rates are in line with Europe.

            The problem with deontological arguments is, they tend to develop along lines that people are comfortable with. Isn&#x27;t it interesting that we find it immoral to think of people besides ourselves having sex, or sex that we dislike? As a gay man, I&#x27;m thrilled your deontology doesn&#x27;t define my world anymore.<p>Your drug-resistant STI argument is circular. If we hadn&#x27;t treated those, we would&#x27;ve been breeding grounds for rampant STIs anyway-- whether they would&#x27;ve been drug-resistant would be immaterial.<p>And in a world where we acknowledge that promiscuity is a trait that displays in humans, whether they&#x27;re shunned for it or not, we can provide open and honest education on how to handle that sex safely.

            Right, blame it on social conservatism when the HPV vaccine costs $1000 even if you have Medicaid or ACA. In fact, Medicaid and ACA don’t even cover it. The cheapest price for the HPV vaccine in rural America is at the nearby Walmart. But it is $330 per shot, and you have to take 3 shots, and Medicaid and ACA won’t even cover it.<p>If you’re blaming social conservatism, then I’m calling you out for an out-of-touch liberal.

            It was only approved in 2018 for over-26, so it&#x27;d be a bit rich to blame that on the ACA. Yell at your insurer if they don&#x27;t cover it.

            There&#x27;s no platonic &#x27;free&#x27; market anywhere on earth, and I&#x27;m not sure there ever has been. Each society is a collection of socialized and privatized services. America has socialized fire departments, police departments, regulators, courts, health care for the poorest and old, army, passenger rail, mail delivery etc.<p>Some services are better provided collectively (schools, prisons, healthcare) and some are better provided by the private markets (Apple). The former strengthens the latter.<p>At the end of the day even the &#x27;socialized medicine&#x27; debate isn&#x27;t such a big decision. It&#x27;s just about extending socialized medicine in the US from 40% of the population (today covered by Medicare and Medicaid) to 100%. It&#x27;s clearly better of course - as John Oliver expressed &#x27;there&#x27;s a right way and a wrong way to do healthcare and we do it the <i>wrong</i> way&#x27;. But it is, on the spectrum of absolute socialism to absolute capitalism, a small tweak.

            This is quite cynical.

Vaccines don&#x27;t stop you getting a disease they prepare your immune system for it, so when it happens you are more likely to survive.<p>Seems to me Spanish government bodies (where I live) look at headline case rates and then start making bizarre rules without talking to the scientists.

            The vaccine could have stopped the disease if they&#x27;d opted for IgA immunity instead of IgG. That means getting drops in your nose rather than a jab, so that immmune cells are activated in the mucosas rather than in the blood.
Right now someone who&#x27;s been vaccinated can continue to replicate and transmite the virus from the glial cells in the nose mucosa, because the immune cells there haven&#x27;t been trained to fight the virus.

            Almost no vaccines are sterilising and that is a very high threshold to meet.<p>Polio and measles vaccines are not even sterilising. It is much more realistic to achieve herd immunity with vaccines than it is to create a sterilising vaccine.

            The confusion you are spreading is the same as ignoring the difference between HIV and AIDs. If a vaccine was developed that prevented an HIV infection from causing AIDs, you would be the guy telling people it&#x27;s safe to have unprotected sex even if you have HIV, as long as you&#x27;re vaccinated. The mRNA vaccine does not prevent the infection from taking place, it prevents the infection from developing into the disease.<p>mRNA vaccines do not prevent the spread of SARS-COV-2, they are highly effective at preventing a SARS-COV-2 infection from causing COVID-19.

            At current stage, covid vaccines are mainly to reduce severity of infections with significant reduction in mortality. It doesn&#x27;t really reduce spread of infections. Research has shown vaccinated individuals at least the same amount of load as unvacccinated. The general sayings of herd immunity with vaccinations can protect those unable to get vaccines don&#x27;t apply for this situation. In fact, it will pretty much condemn those who don&#x27;t get vaccinated when vast majority have been vaccinated and actively spread the infections.

            A vaccinated person has equal viral load to an unvaccinated person? That&#x27;s not substantiated by any of the available evidence AFAIK.<p>Early on the question was &quot;can a vaccinated person transmit the virus?&quot; and the answer to that question is yes; but, even with a low viral load, that can still be the case. So the vaccinated person can end up transmitting, but not as much, as an unvaccinated person. If the person asking the question wants just a yes or no answer, then the answer has to be yes. But that&#x27;s not the full picture.

            The point is that what other people not willing to do, or being afraid to do, can be difficult for them, even if irrational. 
I personally can&#x27;t think of easier thing than losing weight when you know you will die younger and know the present life has worse quality of life as well.
Of course the obesity problem has their own anti vaxxer movement where people claim obesity and health problems are not related, that it&#x27;s beautiful etc.

            If drastically reducing the incidence of drug&#x2F;alcohol addiction and sports injuries was as easy as administering 2 shots, we wouldn&#x27;t be having this discussion.<p>It is ultimately your choice.

            Can we expect that people who aren&#x27;t vaccinated show some solidarity... And vaccinate themselves?<p>Solidarity with defectors only works when there are enough resources for everyone. When there aren&#x27;t, we triage. First come first serve, at the expense of people who have not defected is a stupid way to allocate those resources, when there&#x27;s such a simple preventative measure available.

            It doesn&#x27;t really change the fact that you haven&#x27;t put much thought into your opinions. Even when people have given answers to your easily googleable questions &quot;why fear unvaxxed people if the disease is mild?&quot;, instead of taking in the information, maybe even thanking them, you move on to your next grievance instead.<p>That&#x27;s typical anti-vaxxer behaviour, so the reaction you&#x27;re getting is understandable. Your outrage is preventing you from even admitting one mistake in your reasoning before you move onto the next point.<p>I&#x27;d go into further detail about unvaxxed populations being breeding grounds for mutations which might even escape the serious disease efficacy that the current vaccines give us (didn&#x27;t see you arguing against that), but I think it would be wasted on you.<p>&gt;I can&#x27;t vote, go to an hospital, shopping mall or restaurant without a QRCODE.<p>As others have informed you, you can with a negative test result.
For what it&#x27;s worth, I agree code based systems should be time limited to prevent long term abuse of such systems.

&gt; you move onto the next point.<p>I&#x27;m not moving anywhere. I&#x27;m trying to show you nothing is logical.<p>If the vaccine is 94% effective at preventing serious disease it means the harsh measures are absolutely uncalled for.<p>Yes vulnerable people will die, it&#x27;s a sad truth but you don&#x27;t install the premises of dictatorship in a country, kill the economy just because a few people will die. They would die of something else if not COVID.<p>Right now in France we have about 60 deaths a day due to COVID. 1400 are dying everyday too for other reasons. On a country of 67 millions, this is a non event.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d go into further detail about unvaxxed populations being breeding grounds for mutations<p>You see I have read the exact opposite because the vaccine puts pressure on the virus to evolve to bypass it. Anyway it&#x27;s absolutely impossible to prove one way or another.<p>&gt; As others have informed you, you can with a negative test result.<p>I know this perfectly well mind you. My problem isn&#x27;t the test it&#x27;s the QRCODE: this is the slippery slope that gets us directly toward worse than China.

            This is a very bad comment.<p>Delta is one of the most transmissive and dangerous viruses in history. Many times worse than previous strains of COVID. Delta has the capability of burning through communities even with relatively high vaccine coverage. We are dealing with a historically dangerous strain!<p>And despite this, daily deaths are significantly lower per capita than previous outbreaks in Isreal despite daily case loads being already as high as previous outbreaks.<p>If anything, what&#x27;s happening in Isreal is an indicator that not only are vaccines working, but they are working well. Even as efficacy has reduced over time.<p>And lastly, efficacy of a COVID vaccine feels kinda orthogonal to efficacy of an HIV vaccine, no?

            Claims about Delta being &quot;more infectious&quot; are the same claim that was made for all the others. Dig into how they try to calculate that and you&#x27;ll find the exact type of models that have repeatedly failed so far.<p>Remember: the UK released most of its restrictions, including masks and lockdowns in a so-called &quot;freedom day&quot;. Experts said the country was performing a dangerous experiment on the entire world. Cases started plunging just three days later. To compare people pointing out the proven, beyond any doubt unreliability of claims about COVID to flat earthers shows just how ideological and blind this whole thing has become.

            How can you sleep at night? There are literally millions of dead and you are letting these right wing trolls opposed to medical care run freely over this site behind this fig leaf of civility.<p>Five minutes ago on the front page there was a post about the new NYC executive order with multiple comments calling for the murder of scientists. Not saying history will remember them badly, calling for their murder. This is sick, and you’re helping it. It is time to stop coddling these people who are actively trying to prolong the pandemic.<p>Every day on this site I see dozens of comments that are pushing a lethal agenda of preventing common sense public health actions like vaccination and masking. Making your predominant concern enforcement of tone is enabling mass death. Normally the moderation on HN is pretty good and evenhanded, but on this topic for some reason you seem to be pretty okay with people calling for the deaths of innocents as long as they do it with nice words. It has been ALMOST TWO YEARS! Every step of the way these people have tried to poison the well of public discourse. First it was a liberal hoax, then it was going away any day, then it was the flu, then it was “it’s only in blue cities so let it kill them”, then it was China did it, then it was lockdowns are bad, masks are bad, now it is vaccines are bad. The constant drumbeat of bad faith opposition to getting this catastrophe under control needs to stop - how can you not be exhausted by it?

            My god the insanity here is wildly out of control. As he has pointed out, vaccines don&#x27;t stop transmission in any way, so people&#x27;s individual choices about whether to get vaccinated or not is absolutely not making them &quot;killing people&quot; or &quot;murderers&quot;. If you really want to go there, consider that people are definitely being killed by the vaccines themselves, that is proven beyond doubt now. So it&#x27;s easy to turn that around and say those trying to push vaccines on people who don&#x27;t need them are the &quot;murderers&quot;.

            This is a ridiculous comment.<p>1. Vaccines do stop transmission because they make it less likely your internal systems will get infected<p>2. Vaccines also prevent hospitalizations very effectively<p>3. Known side effects from the vaccine are very, very low.  Much lower than the risk of getting COVID, for the same health outcomes.<p>4. Getting COVID (the bad outcome caused by the virus) has some chance at Long Covid.  The vaccine reduces this because it makes it less likely you get the syndrome after infection.

            Thanks for your kind words I guess. Please remember your comment and reflect on it in 10 years when the politicians will have stole all of your freedoms and you won&#x27;t be able to do anything in life without being tracked, judged and denied.

            You’re twenty years too late for this sentiment. You’re already tracked constantly by everything around you. The vaccines are not a useful method of tracking or control.  Computers and cameras are much better.

            Israel isn&#x27;t even 60% vaccinated. Hospitalizations are way down. Serious infection in vaccinated people is 1&#x2F;6th the rate compared to unvaccinated. That&#x27;s an 84% reduction in risk. Looks to me like things are going well for vaccinated people in Israel. What&#x27;s the story I&#x27;m missing here?

            Pray that the side effects are well-studied before the CDC decides to administer it to every infant within minutes of birth (like they did with Hep B, another sexually-transmitted disease to which most people will never even be exposed.)

            At one point, we should stop saying that hep-* or HIV are STDs, in several countries the bulk of transmissions are from mother to infant during delivery or other means that sex transmissions. With the way the world is connected, these virus can travel easily.

            Because the HepB could disappear within a generation  with mass vaccination, the vaccine is rather cheap, almost lifelong and offers a full protection. And I bet it wasn&#x27;t because of a bunch of antivax. Fuck them for ruining everything.<p>As a French who was teenager in the 90s, I got vaccinated as almost everyone in my class age, and I am glad that French had it as otherwise I could have catch this fucking virus.

            &gt; We don&#x27;t put everyone on a statin simply because<p>Because there are known side effects that make them not suitable to some people.  Pregnant women should not take them (nor those thinking about getting pregnant). Those of Asian decent need a smaller dose. Those who drink alcohol shouldn&#x27;t take them.  Those who take part in extreme exercise shouldn&#x27;t take them.  They cannot be mixed with some other drugs.<p>The above is off the top of my head.  It probably doesn&#x27;t apply to them all, there are several different statins to choose from, and many different dosages. A doctor really needs to work through the above (and probably more factors I&#x27;m not aware of) to figure out what is best for you.
