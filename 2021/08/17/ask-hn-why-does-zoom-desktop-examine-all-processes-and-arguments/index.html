            Zoom has a popular feature which allows for screen sharing a single application window instead of the entire desktop. I assume this is how its discovering running applications with GUI windows open in a cross-platform manner. Perhaps there is a better API for this? Its not a common use-case that an app would need to know all of the other open windows, but it seems like a perfectly valid use case, and frankly handy for sharing a PPT without fear of an embarrassing email showing up in during a meeting.

            There’s nothing in &#x2F;proc&#x2F;PID&#x2F;cmdline etc that would definitely confirm an app has a GUI. The two concepts are at very different layers of the stack — to the OS the GUI is just another app on top of the kernel. Mayyyyyybe Zoom could be doing some crude pattern matching on process name or environment variables of a given process (though it’d only be able to read data of processes running as the same user) but it’s a long shot.<p>Personally I’d guess it is either some other library Zoom uses or some kind of debug info capturing system. But I don’t know work at Zoom so who knows.

            This is an unlikely stretch, but it looks like they&#x27;re also attempting to read `&#x2F;proc&#x2F;PID&#x2F;exe` -- they could be doing something (extremely) cursed like attempting to parse the program linkages and filtering by programs that link to `libX11`. But that&#x27;s me straining to explain this in the context of the GP&#x27;s hypothesis.

            Why would you implement such a overly complex and unreliable thing when:<p>1. The windows manager can provide you with a list of open windows.<p>2. Screensharing including only sharing specific windows is a feature provided by the windows manager over standardized protocols.<p>3. Even knowing the processes which do have a GUI doesn&#x27;t allow you to share that GUI, at least not without going through roughly the same mechanisms as mentioned in 2nd.

            Sure. But that&#x27;s a <i>very</i> distinct task vs. the implication that Zoom is somehow making ad revenue off of Linux process names. The latter strikes me as not very likely because there&#x27;s no money in it; the former is well outside of anything I feel qualified to opine on.

            I believe they mean grab the absolute path to the real executable, run ldd against it, and parse that output to see if it links against libX11. That doesn&#x27;t tell you a program is really using X11, though, as plenty have some sort of no-gui option to launch without a window. You can always cat &#x2F;proc&#x2F;{PID}&#x2F;maps to see if libx11 is actually loaded into the process&#x27; address space, and just use readlink on exe to figure out the application name.<p>That&#x27;s a really stupid way to figure out if a program has a window, though, compared to just using the X11 API directly.

            Nope, and I&#x27;m not going to run zoom to find out. To be perfectly clear, I&#x27;m not at all trying to say I have evidence that this is what zoom is actually doing. I&#x27;m trying to say I believe this is what the upper-level post was suggesting zoom is doing.

            You wouldn’t actually need to execute `ldd` to get this information: you could parse the ELF entirely in user space. That, in turn, wouldn’t show up in the `strace` logs, since there would be no syscalls. I think that’s extremely unlikely, but it’s certainly possible.

            Sure, but you could minimize it to just two: the `open` that we already see here, and an `mmap` that maps the entire thing in. The rest could be in userspace (at least in terms of effects). We only have an excerpt of the syscall trace, so it&#x27;s possible that happens.<p>But again: <i>extraordinarily</i> unlikely.

            I can easily believe either.  However, while the default assumption of laziness&#x2F;incompetence works well for good faith discussions, it also provides cover for malicious actors.  At some point, even though any given actor is likely to be non-malicious, there is no way to distinguish them from the malicious actors.

            I’d argue that laziness is worse in security&#x2F;privacy situations than malicious intent. At least malicious intent only exposes me to Zoom and whoever they answer to. Their laziness, however, which would probably also reflect itself in other security situations, exposes me to them as well as basically the entire world of black hat hackers.

            Based on OP&#x27;s snippet they&#x27;re probably doing this on Linux. Assuming the presence of X11 and an EWMH-compatible window manager, they could query X11 directly and ask the root window for its `_NET_CLIENT_LIST` attribute. That, in turn, would list every &quot;semantic&quot; (i.e., non-decorative) window currently open on the current display.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t work for non-X11 or if the WM is non-EWMH compliant. Presumably Wayland has a similar API, and non-EWMH is probably a minuscule group that considers this a desirable feature.

            One of the selling points of Wayland is, that they have no such API. An Application is supposed to be unable to access windows (and their corresponding keyboard&#x2F;mouse input).<p>One of the downsides this has is the described issue of &quot;screensharing beeing impossible on wayland&quot;. This is solved by the XDG Desktop Portal, which provides a unified dbus interface across the different compositor implementations for requesting a pipewire file descriptor (which can be used with gstreamer to get a live video stream of the deskop, in a way far superior to x11 framegrab). 
However the implementation differs for each compositor, GNOME for example asks you if you what to share the whole screen or just a specific application but wlroots (swaywm, wayfire, etc.) AFAIK automatically accepts and shares the whole screen. I don&#x27;t know what KDE Plasma does.

            I initially miss read you post, you formulations can be a bit misleading.<p>E.g. &quot;Wayland is, that they have no such API.&quot;, it has screen sharing APIs but they are different and require you do go through other programs like XDG Desktop Portal and Pipewire to allow the user to control such access. Similar this also means Wayland supports screen sharing just in different ways.<p>Anyway the important parts are:<p>- the implementation might differ, but the API doesn&#x27;t (or at least not by a relevant degree)<p>- wayland requires you to go through specific APIs for screen sharing, scanning processes has little to do with screen sharing on either wayland or X.

            &gt; Presumably Wayland ...<p>Yes there is a wayland extension for screen sharing and also support for sharing just one application.<p>It provides screen sharing on KDE, Gnome and most wlroots based WMs.<p>Through wlroots doesn&#x27;t yet (or maybe does by now) support sharing a specific window I think, but this mean it <i>doesn&#x27;t support sharing a specific window</i> and knowing which process belongs to a window doesn&#x27;t really help you there either...

            Sounds like it works a little differently on Linux.<p>To be honest, I&#x27;m actually surprised and impressed that they support screen share in the Linux version because of how many different flavors of i.e. WM there are in the wild.

            I don&#x27;t believe that the WM would enter into it — as long as folks are using X11 the code should be, I think, the same for any WM or DE.<p>Now, using Wayland it may or may not be possible, depending on which WM&#x2F;compositor&#x2F;whatever you are running.

            &gt; Why would it do that?<p>We can answer part of that with just a little more reading.  What&#x27;s pid 3844872?<p>For me, the series of queries against &#x2F;proc happen from a process that, just a bit earlier, called exec.  So it&#x27;s not really zoom reading &quot;all processes and arguments&quot; but ... `pidof gnome-session`, so I guess zoom is looking for the pid of gnome-session.<p>To what nefarious purpose zoom intends to put this knowledge of gnome-session&#x27;s pid, I can&#x27;t say - I am not running gnome-session so my trail goes cold; but at least for me, for that particular run, zoom itself doesn&#x27;t actually see the contents of all of those files.

            ^ This is the correct answer.<p>I installed the Zoom client just to have a look for myself. The syscalls in question emanate from freshly forked processes that immediately execvp() the command `pidof` (on my system it finds it under &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin, so it&#x27;s the system command, not anything fishy shipped by Zoom). Actually, the command-line argument to the command is, in succession:<p>gnome-session<p>gnome-panel<p>gnome-shell<p>gnome-session-binary<p>ksmserver<p>cinnamon<p>cinnamon-session<p>mate-panel<p>mate-session<p>xfce-mcs-manage<p>xfce4-panel<p>xfce4-session<p>I suppose Zoom goes through the whole list on my system because it finds none of them. The fact that it stops on parent&#x27;s system suggests that Zoom stops when it finds one. This hints at a very crude way to determine the desktop environment!

            &gt; This hints at a very crude way to determine the desktop environment!<p>That is a good discovery.<p>It&#x27;s probably one of the better ways to detect the running desktop environment as the user might have multiple environments installed and just uses one of them currently, as such looking for installed things doesn&#x27;t work reliable.<p>And looking for env variables can be unreliable.<p>And scanning the dbug might not be that use-full either.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure what they use that for.

            Zoom has attention tracking, which when enabled silently, shows an admin if the screen is maximized or if the user is focused on other applications. They don&#x27;t yet tell admins what other apps the user is active in, just whether the user is active.<p>Another angle for Zoom to do that, is that it is a massive Chinese spyware application, which can target users by meta data or IP, like it did by messing with the calls of activists. A bit like how anti-virus companies are sometimes charged with exfiltrating secret documents.

            The issue is that the model on Linux is different.

            Usually postprocessing requires significant computing power. This is something that might matter for people maximizing battery usage. But another person in the same thread says in the case of Zoom it&#x27;s the opposite - the web app seems more CPU-intensive.

            You can test it by throttling your network speed down from your router and compare the desktop and web version performance. The desktop version will sacrifice video quality (to the point of stuttering on very low bandwidth) in order to maintain audio quality, which massively increase usability on poor network condition.

            Does teams work for your in a FF container? For me it always ends up in a redirect loop :( but my work uses MCAS for external computers so that may have to do with it. It&#x27;s a proxy service from MS that adds some supposed security to their services and makes them even slower.

            Honestly, I kind of agree with this downvoted post. The MacOS permissions prompts are starting to drive me apeshit. Average user is going to start ignoring them and just click yes to everything anyways. Just like everybody already does on their phones. Reminds me of when Windows Vista came out and they started prompting for permissions like crazy. Everybody hated it. Maybe it was just ahead of its time.<p>I already granted this permission to Teams on my Mac. It&#x27;s not malicious now, but when an update comes out in the future, it could be, and I&#x27;ve already allowed it. So this whole thing feels  kinda dumb.

            What&#x27;s the solution then? MacOS is exposing how often these programs are requiring privileged access.<p>The solution is partly for applications to limit their use of elevated privileges which we can&#x27;t always rely on. Therefore MacOS is exposing and providing users with visibility and choice.

            Wayland is even more strict, you ask it for screen sharing and it gives you the stream. If the compositor doesn&#x27;t support screen sharing you&#x27;re out of luck, there&#x27;s just no way to read the contents of a window.<p>With X11 if the window manager doesn&#x27;t have the relevant support you can always ask the server.

            In a PID namespace [1], it will be able to read &#x2F;proc, but will see nothing interesting other than a strangely empty system.

            &gt; Is there any way to prevent it?<p>Firejail[0] allows cobbling together various linux sandboxing features, including namespaces which should result in an isolated proc filesystem which doesn&#x27;t see the other processes. But I don&#x27;t know if the default profile for zoom does that, you have to test it or write your own.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;netblue30&#x2F;firejail" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;netblue30&#x2F;firejail</a>

            It “leaks” which apps you’re using if the developer explicitly talks to the discord client. Discord provides an SDK for game developers etc which can talk to discord client and show the game you’re playing and optionally let you invite people to your lobby straight from the discord chat. It doesn’t scan anything or open any processes, it just opens an IPC socket.

            I think it does scan your processes. If I go to &quot;User Settings &quot; =&gt; &quot;Activity Status&quot; =&gt; &quot;Not seeing your game? Add it!&quot; =&gt; &quot;Select&quot; then I see many processes that almost certainly have no explicit discord integration. I believe they do this to allow the user to opt into showing their status based on running processes so that any application can be supported.

            Yeah, it scans processes but seems to limit sharing what you are running to what it thinks are games unless you explicitly add the application. Still, anyone concerned about privacy should really sandbox these proprietary applications or just use the web version.

            I&#x27;m going to assume this happens when you <i>aren&#x27;t trying to share your screen</i>.<p>I once worked on a file synchronization application that would scan processes when files were locked. I don&#x27;t remember if we put the process name in the UI, but we logged detailed information about the other process in case someone contacted support. (Sometimes users ran weird applications that kept files locked.) I believe we had to scan through all processes and inspect their open file handles.<p>I would assume some things like: Maybe there are applications that are known to cause problems for Zoom? Maybe some applications lock the camera or microphone? Maybe some applications hog the CPU and cause encoder problems?<p>If you really want to know more, consider decompiling zoom and&#x2F;or looking at strings compiled into the binary.

            It happens right at startup, and is a result of some calls (via the usual fork&#x2F;exec dance) to `pidof ...` seemingly trying to identify the window manager being used, possibly for telemetry or possibly to change behavior.  Decompiling would be more certain (I don&#x27;t have ghidra on this computer and it&#x27;s a little more effort than I want to go to) but the pattern is pretty visible in the strace dump.

            Maybe it has to alter behavior based on your distro?<p>IMO, if you can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t reverse engineer, maybe see if you can contact Zoom support and see what they say?

            Be careful with this. In some orgs you can get a bit of a bad reputation for being technically incompetent if you can&#x27;t get zoom to run.<p>Zoom is very invasive &#x2F; flexible - so it&#x27;s actually somewhat hard to have it NOT work.

There were quite a few who couldn&#x27;t figure it out. I gave 2nd chances interviews, mostly for optics for upper management. (And because sometimes hardware breaks at the last minute.) The candidates always failed the retry interview.<p>At least for software development, troubleshooting a camera and mic is a pretty similar skill to what our job is on a day-to-day basis. It&#x27;s also very disrespectful to make someone wait at the beginning of a meeting while you troubleshoot, especially when I&#x27;m waving my phone and sending IMs that ask the candidate to just use their phone.<p>But, if a candidate fell back to their phone, I appreciated that they respected my time.

            Then I guess your IT department or your management is happy to share your work computer&#x27;s content with Zoom. I see three paths:<p>- Resort to use Zoom in a browser, maybe from a separate profile<p>- If this does not work for you, use Zoom from a virtual machine (it should be possible by exporting the camera likely connected by USB to the VM)<p>- If you&#x27;d like to avoid a VM because it&#x27;s heavy &#x2F; annoying, I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s an easy solution without learning how to use namespaces and unshare.<p>Additionally, and optionally:<p>- Gently campaign against Zoom or for a better solution internally.

            Yes! It&#x27;s a literal tradeoff between security and functionality, the same tradeoff that people make every day.<p>Figure out which one you want; Zoom is unwilling to give you both, even when you&#x27;re paying them.

            You have to pretend that Zoom doesn&#x27;t work and then it eventually gives you the &quot;join from browser&quot; link.<p>When you click on a Zoom meeting, it will prompt you to launch xdg-open -- cancel it. Then hit launch again -- cancel the xdg-open again -- and then the &quot;Join from browser&quot; link should pop up after a few times.<p>Sometimes it tries to capture you, I had to click on trucks and trains for 15 minutes before it let me in, and then had to apologize for being 15 minutes late to the meeting.

            Discord does. It makes some sense, since Discord has a feature to broadcast what game you&#x27;re currently playing (or anything you want), but I found it was scanning &#x2F;proc even when I turned this off.<p>I didn&#x27;t like that, and I spent a lot of time and effort working out various ways to keep it out of &#x2F;proc (or anywhere else while I was at it- mostly with AppArmor) and ultimately ended up running it in a container with systemd-nspawn. This is still a little bit fiddly, but seems to work reliably and without any issues.

            That&#x27;s probably the better answer, yeah. I think there&#x27;s a couple of features that don&#x27;t work very well in the browser (push to talk?), but the actual answer is that it probably simply didn&#x27;t occur to me at the time.<p>I use both these days.

            I think I tried one of those alternative app distribute-y things at the time, but I don&#x27;t remember which, and I came away disappointed. If memory serves, I couldn&#x27;t establish whether it actually did any sandboxing, or what it did by default (like intentionally opening up this exact hole), and certainly not how to configure it, and gave up shortly in favor of something I&#x27;d at least seen before.<p>It <i>might</i> have been Snap.

            When you run proprietary software, you basically give full control over your computer to a third party. For the best security use a separate physical machine for stuff like this.

            I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but I&#x27;m not sure that last one is zoom&#x27;s fault.  It sounds like Zoom is just calling ShellExecute(&quot;open&quot;, link), and is getting blamed for the fact that Windows will then connect to random server on public internet and can be convinced to send a hash of the password that can be used to forge a different connection from a different host&#x2F;client pair with the same credentials.

            It&#x27;s the mechanism meant for untrusted links, and it&#x27;s the prescribed way for instance to open a link in the user&#x27;s default browser.  If Chrome took that link and started sending the user&#x27;s password hash, that&#x27;d clearly be Chrome&#x27;s fault.  Same with, say, an ftp client that listened for ftp paths and would send replayable hashes as the first step.  It&#x27;s clearly SMB&#x27;s terrible protocol.  Yes they removed UNC paths to hack around this... but they shouldn&#x27;t have to.  Nope should they be expected to have known about this particular Windows footgun, IMO.

            I know a really good way to prevent it. Don&#x27;t use zoom :) Seriously they&#x27;ve done so many things that show they don&#x27;t care about privacy.
