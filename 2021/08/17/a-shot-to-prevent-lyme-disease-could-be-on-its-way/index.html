            What shocks me most with this story is that there <i>is</i> a vaccine (Lymerix), and it&#x27;s pretty effective (76-92 percent after three injections) but apparently some anti-vax propaganda and a class-action lawsuit essentially removed it from the market. Based on a very rare side effect. Wtf? How can that be? Just tell people the risks of side effects, and if they are ok with that risk then the manufacturer is off the hook.<p>I&#x27;d totally take that shot. 59 cases out of 1.4 million is nothing, and even for those it&#x27;s unclear how they actually were related to the shot.<p>Sadly, this indicates that the new shot could suffer the same fate. Give it to a million people, some will <i>for sure</i> have some issue, anti-vaxers come with conspiracy theories and convince a few to a class action, and there we go, another few decades without a shot. Gotta be fast this time before it&#x27;s too late again.

            I live in Minnesota and am being treated for Lyme disease for the second time in 15 months. It&#x27;s no joke. The first time I got Lyme, it came with a painful shingles co-infection on top of the usual symptoms.<p>Now the second time, I am again worried about getting sick with something else while in an immunocompromised state. The fatigue, fever, and back pain that came along this second time was worse than the first. I needed a nap after walking up the stairs.<p>So, I am curious how bad and prolonged the side effects were in these 59 adverse events. If only temporary, I&#x27;d consider it worth it over getting the actual disease.<p>The article also asks, &quot;Why vaccinate against something that can be cured with antibiotics?&quot; Undiagnosed Lyme becomes harder to treat the longer you wait, and the dose of antibiotics longer and more intense.<p>(PS: I am so very thankful for doxycycline.)

            I had Lyme twice as a kid too (in suburban Pennsylvania). It&#x27;s not fun and it&#x27;s a bit crazy that you can get it more than once. People are usually shocked when I tell them. I knew someone who was temporarily paralyzed on one side because of Lyme that they diagnosed late - it&#x27;s scary.

            I grew up in CT. Had it 4 times, only got the bullseye once.  It is no joke, and as you get older it seems to suck more and more. Last time I had numbness in my face as the only symptom, but...thrice bitten, fully paranoid, and I was treated pretty fast.<p>One thing which is important with a vaccine is that when I was a kid (early 90s) the rate of ticks carrying lyme was in the 10% range or less, while now it is &gt;50%. A vaccine is critical.

            I didn&#x27;t have the bullseye the second time either I was just extremely tired and had a mild fever. That&#x27;s how it often goes, and if my mom hadn&#x27;t recognized the nonspecific symptoms it could have been a lot worse.

            How do you manage to get it so often? I live in an area that is endemic to Lyme, but it&#x27;s something that can easily be avoided (much easier than Covid). But I do see reckless behaviour all the time as well, so maybe it is not that surprising.

            I live in Sweden, I know several people who got Borrelia infections including my girlfriend, and hers developed into Lyme once. Most caught it and treated it early but some just had a fever and only discovered it was Lyme after months.<p>It&#x27;s insidious, if you spend time in nature you are exposing yourself to it. The ticks will be on tall grass, falling from trees, crawling from the ground. How can that be avoided?<p>During summer we have to check ourselves for ticks every single night, my girlfriend lives in a house inside a wooded area, I have a big garden on my house where deers are commonly spotted (this past month I&#x27;ve been visited by one every single day).<p>No, it&#x27;s not easy to be avoided if you leave the house, just laying on my lawn or garden grass is enough to get me paranoid about it. My housemates have already found 3 ticks stuck to them.<p>Please, if you know an easy way to avoid all of this I&#x27;d love to hear it but so far I only know to be cautious and vigilant.

            &gt;<i>Please, if you know an easy way to avoid all of this I&#x27;d love to hear it but so far I only know to be cautious and vigilant.</i><p>I&#x27;m late to this so don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll see it, but I live in rural New England and ticks have become ever more horrendous here, yet I haven&#x27;t had a single one in, a decade at least? The big thing for me has been getting a solid set of permethrin utilizing full coverage clothing (look for branding like &quot;Insect Shield&quot;), including socks and a hat with neck protection, combined with occasional judicious usage of repellent (I suggest 20% picaridin instead of DEET, something like Sawyer Products which has almost no smell and won&#x27;t melt polymers that deet will). Having clothing that one can just put on for going out and boom high protection makes it so convenient vs applying repellent that I never fail to, and it has done exactly what was promised. They don&#x27;t last forever, after 50-70 washings they need to be replaced, but if using them in a focused way for outdoor usage that can last a good while.<p>I&#x27;d still absolutely leap at a vaccine if available, but physical&#x2F;chemical protection does work so the trick is making it convenient enough and enough of a habit to be 100% consistent about it.

            If you consider enjoying nature as &quot;reckless behavior&quot; then the shared understanding needed as a basis for a conversation may be missing. Lying in the grass looking at sky and stars, running through the forest with your dog, go pick mushrooms. That&#x27;s very natural behaviour, not &quot;reckless&quot;. Of course you can sit indoors all day, but I prefer a vaccine and enjoy nature instead.

            3 of the times I was under 15. I liked to play in the woods and did yard work. I used deet, etc, but I guess was just unlucky. The last time I was 22, had just moved back to CT from college and got a tick while mountain biking. I noticed it when I checked, but I guess it had been on long enough.

            You should play powerball with that type of luck!!!  I pick embedded ticks off my body 6 out of 7 days each week, for about 3-4 months each year for many years, and have yet to face consequences...but then, I don&#x27;t go to get medical attention often, so, who knows, maybe I&#x27;ve had it?

            Shingles is caused by varicella (chickenpox) virus that&#x27;s already latent in your nerves. Really unlikely that it was a &quot;co-infection&quot;, it just reactivated because your body was busy fighting Lyme.

            I&#x27;m not sure what you think &quot;co-infection&quot; means, but you just described precisely that. The reactivation of shingles meant that he was simultaneously infected with two different agents. &quot;Co-infection&quot; (for me at least) implies nothing about how or where the secondary infection came from.

            That&#x27;s fair. It&#x27;s a really commonly implied thing among the quackier side of Lyme treatment that every tick is going to unload a clown car full of pathogens (used to justify even more unvalidated tests). But, by the definition, it&#x27;s just co-occurring infections regardless of vector.

            &gt; that every tick is going to unload a clown car full of pathogens<p>They mostly are, though. Lyme is not the only horrible disease. There&#x27;s Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and other nasty shit. As a kid, I was in the woods every day. Didn&#x27;t get a tick for years, despite walking through thick woods in shorts. Then I got stung a few times, didn&#x27;t think much of it. Then I got Lyme. Had terrible joint pains for months despite immediately taking Doxycycline. Since then I almost never went deeper into the woods again. You&#x27;re immediately full of ticks. I once picked up a piece of trash that was on the side of the path and immediately had a tick crawling on my hand. What a nasty infestation of our woods. Did you know that Lyme is a sexually transmitted disease (STD)? Yes, if you have intercourse with someone who has Lyme, you may get infected as well. Lyme is a horror show.

            You&#x27;re mixing up a few things here. Every drug has a list of side effects. They are known, that&#x27;s what your doctor tells you, and then you make an informed decision whether you want to take the drug or not.<p>It&#x27;s not Medical Doctors that decided to withdraw approval and then removed it from the market. The approval was all fine. What was not fine was the public perception. Because the anti-vax campaign was very effective. Too many people started to think it&#x27;s too fishy, so out of caution didn&#x27;t want the shot anymore, so it became unprofitable to keep it on the market, so the manufacturer pulled it. (A bit surprising they didn&#x27;t sell the IP or license it cheaply to somebody more adventurous..)<p>That&#x27;s how your life can get impacted if the anti-vax lobby gets too strong, and that&#x27;s what scares me. They can mess up their own health as much as they like, but once my life gets worse because of it, I have a problem.

            If the product causes provable harm then company should be prosecuted criminally by the state to determine if the testing done was sufficeint and there was no faul play.<p>But letting random people sue manufacturer because they have some symptoms at later point in time than the time they took the vaccine is just recipie for what already happened on case of Lyme vaccine.

            Criminal charges in the US <i>are</i> pursued by the Government. The idea of private citizens deciding whether to press charges is widely misunderstood; District&#x2F;US Attorneys can take a victim&#x27;s wishes into consideration when deciding to charge a defendant (it may be difficult to win a case when the primary&#x2F;only witness is uncooperative or conversely even if someone has been the victim of a crime the DA may not pursue a case because they feel they are unlikely to get a conviction) but the decision entirely lies with the Government.<p>Now, as you linked.

            The thing is, we have that process at multiple levels from peer-review and the many stages of government approval and it&#x27;s rigorous to the point that people have questioned whether it&#x27;s causing problems due to delays and costs preventing development of vaccines for less widespread diseases and increasing costs.<p>COVID-19 has provided a great example of how well this process works: even the emergency use authorizations required multiple levels of clinical trials and the anti-vax propagandists mining the VAERS database for talking points can do so because there&#x27;s a requirement to make a public report of anything which happens after someone is vaccinated even if there&#x27;s no real suspicion that it was related to the vaccine.

            The process has its flaws. Poorly designed drugs make it through the FDA process. Blind following is foolish. Skepticism is healthy. I don&#x27;t get software updates as soon as available because, even with the testing, peer reviews, flaws still happen.<p>Further, there were big political and financial reasons to push the vaccines through. Those are all conflicts of interest. Pfizer had millions of doses manufactured before approval. If trial results didn&#x27;t look good, they certainly had the incentive to &quot;massage&quot; the results to get it approved and get those millions of doses sold rather than a huge loss.<p>As the original poster shared, it should be a considered a reasonable position to be skeptical of small scale results. Pfizer&#x27;s position appears to have scaled well (Moderna as well). 100s of millions of doses across diverse populations show its relative safety and efficacy.

            I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s perfect but rather that the skepticism you&#x27;re looking for is found within the process where many scientists who are not employed by the vendor review the test results, methodology, and side effects. By the time something gets through approval, it&#x27;s been tested in thousands of people with monitoring over a substantial time period (even the EUA COVID vaccines were monitored for a period of time longer than vaccine side effects have historically been observed) and reviewed by hundreds of people.<p>We actually have an interesting example which I think validates that process even though it comes in the unlikely form of the FDA&#x27;s recent mistake approving Aducanumab. There is a lot of criticism, including IG investigations, over the approval <i>because</i> it was approved despite having failed to go through the process successfully. The Phase III trials were cancelled after they concluded that the drug was not successful, the FDA&#x27;s internal scientific review found it did not meet the mark, and the outside scientific advisory panel rejected it so strongly that multiple panel members resigned after it was approved anyway. That to me seems like a pretty good argument that the process was doing what we expect and the way to avoid expensive mistakes is to follow it.

            You are welcome to be skeptical. But in the meantime, don&#x27;t cause me to not be able to get a potentially life-saving drug. You may think it&#x27;s a money grab or not tested enough or a conspiracy or a conflict of interest. Fine, don&#x27;t take it.

            If the system is susceptible to anti-vax propaganda thwarting approval of a good vaccine, doesn’t it also follow that the system is  susceptible to big pharma lobbying for the approval of a bad vaccine?<p>If this wondrously robust multi-layered process buckles in the face of a few hysterical anti-vax groups, you should ask yourself how robust it remains in the face of a billion-dollar pharmaceutical conglomerate with politicians in their pockets.

            I think you&#x27;re confused on several points: the vaccine was approved following extensive safety tests but the lawsuits caused the manufacturer to decide it was not worth manufacturing. The U.S. regulators consistently found no connection between the vaccine and the complaints, so the _scientific_ side worked but the legal &#x2F; business side let public safety down.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s no secret that companies have a vested interest in promoting their products but it&#x27;s not like Pfizer says “Trust us, we employ doctors!” and the FDA says “Sounds great, no need to check!”. Each step of that process involves peer-reviewed publications, public data releases, and reviews by panels of scientific experts. It is quite valid to say that companies need to be strictly regulated to keep everyone honest but we don&#x27;t have any indication that this has been happening and anyone who thinks the process is just a large pharma company waving money at doctors to buy silence <i>really</i> needs to learn how cut-throat academic competition is — the career benefits to being the first to report that plot would be huge! Remember also that this happens in many different countries around the world so that hypothetical conspiracy needs to be kept secrete by a multinational group of hundreds or even thousands of people.

            Like all vaccines, they were tested in animals and subsequently by human volunteers _before_ reaching the Phase III clinical trials. Those are double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled experiments which are generally considered the gold standard for medical testing which test cohorts of people who are exposed to the threat and compare both positive and negative outcomes across those populations without either the recipients or the experimenters knowing which people are in which group until afterwards.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0264410X0000520X?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0264410X0...</a><p>&gt; An adjuvanted recombinant vaccine (LYMErix™) has been approved in the United States for the prevention of Lyme disease in adults, and has demonstrated both safety and efficacy. A clinical trial of over 10 000 adults showed 76% efficacy following the third dose of a 0, 1, 12 schedule. Accelerated schedules demonstrate equivalent levels of protective antibody. Up to 100% of children 2–14 years of age achieve seroprotective levels of antibody. Booster doses induced protective levels of antibody in more than 96% of recipients when administered at months 12 and 24. Only mild or moderate, transient vaccine-associated adverse events have been reported after immunization. The vaccine is a safe and effective method of preventing Lyme disease.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2870557&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2870557&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; The OspA vaccines proved effective in animal models and safe in human volunteers [18]. Both manufacturers conducted clinical trials in a race to gain the first license for their vaccine [19, 20]. In the LYMErix™ phase III safety and efficacy trial, researchers enrolled 10 906 subjects between 15 and 70 years old who lived in endemic areas and randomized them to receive either the three-dose Lyme vaccine regimen or placebo injections. Vaccinated individuals showed a 76% reduction in Lyme disease in the year following vaccination [20], with no significant side-effects noted. Based on these promising findings, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix™ on 21 December 1998.

            In regard to the Lyme disease vaccine issue, you are glossing over a very important component of the story.<p>Due to public pressure, the FDA reconvened to take another look.<p>While the FDA did not change its opinion (except for requesting some additional labeling and studies) the effect was disastrous for marketing. Sales plummeted. And, it was no longer worthwhile to pursue. The ‘official act’ of the FDA reconvening arose solely due to pressure.<p>That’s my point.<p>If anti-vax groups can cause the FDA to “take another look” at a drug that has already passed muster, it is obvious and not fairly deniable that the agency is not immune to political pressure.

            The difficulty with that exemption is that either a good or a bad actor would ask for it. A good actor to avoid being the target of frivolous suits and a bad actor to have cover for their actions. Because a good or bad actor would behave the same in this respect, people bring their own conceptions to the table and see what they expect to see (in either direction).

            I think it is presented that way by some, but in reality, the existence of the exemption and VAERS may also help with monitoring both actors more closely, by reducing the perceived stakes and costs of tracking side-effects. Thus the exemption could help catch and punish bad actors faster, and protect good actors.<p>Legally speaking, I expect the exemption says something about not lying to the FDA in the fine print, so true bad actors would not be able to hide behind the exemption either.

            Yet they don’t have such an exemption for penicillin, or aspirin, or any other similar drug.<p>The liability shield is precisely why I am Covid-vaccine hesitant. And Pfizer’s track record of honesty when it comes to their drugs is significantly bad. Combine that with the aggressive attempts to silence even a discussion of the vaccine’s side effects makes me extremely skeptical. When “everybody” says something is “safe and effective” and the people profiting “bigly” from that something while also being shielded from literally any liability… Well, that’s enough to make me zig when others zag.<p>A simple arthritis drug advertised on TV has to disclose the litany of side effects — so extensive as to be comical and yet even mentioning Covid vaccine side effects can get you silenced on social media — something is just very wrong about that. You want me to vaccinate my four kids just because the government says “trust us?” Nope. I’m a grown up. I also have a scientific research background. But when even scientific papers get removed (specifically pre-Covid papers on masks and influenza,) then I’m even more likely to mistrust the “experts.”<p>To be clear (not that I should have to,) I don’t have the Covid vaccine, but I have all sorts of others. So do my kids. I have vaccines covering everything from Yellow Fever to Japanese Encephalitis and everything in between. But this current vaccine effort reminds me too readily of the anthrax vaccine they were giving us in the Army in the early 2000s. All sorts of neurological issues were reported in many soldiers — often so bad they had to leave the military. And then, as now, it was “safe and effective.” And a rotavirus vaccine in 1999 was pulled from the market because of a rare but serious side effect. Yet the Covid vaccines have a much higher instance of rare but serious side effects compared to that, but everyone is running around saying that the benefits outweigh the risks. Mathematically, for my age and health, that just isn’t true. Ans it’s certainly not true for most healthy children. My point isn’t to debate the vaccine though, my point is to call attention to how the debate is censored. I could very much be wrong in my concerns. Or I could be right. But the fact that we can’t even have a discussion about it is the real problem. We could also apply this to masks. Calling attention to the lack of RCTs and the over-reliance of observational studies gets you branded as an anti-science caveman extremist. Musing as to why control groups were vaccinated (thus destroying long term safety and efficacy data points) also make you an outcast.<p>What we are seeing isn’t science. It’s politics wrapped in an appeal to authority. The effort to over-censor literally everything contrary to Faucian doctrine has backfired and created a significant group of resisters who, frankly, have little trust in governments.

            Why don&#x27;t they understand the pathway for the side effect and figure out a diagnostic test for it so people who&#x27;re hesitant&#x2F;worried (or everyone does it to protect everyone from the side effect) so they can be screened out from getting the vaccine then?

            &quot;Not panicking&quot; is not the goal of the vaccine. The instinctive reaction of the human brain around panicking the same amount over an X chance versus a 4X chance of something happening is a brain bug, not a reason to avoid a vaccine.<p>That 76% (or more) reduction in risk of your panic turning into serious disease is the reason to get the vaccine even if you&#x27;re still panicky.

            I understand where you are coming from. You will be worried about ticks with or without the vaccine. I will too! But I think the vaccine isn’t for making you stop protecting yourself from ticks (it can’t do that, as you noted). The important part is it’s a small poke for a better chance at staying healthy. If you are worried in both cases, the question becomes is the time&#x2F;cost to get the shot worth the result. So if you walk in the woods a lot the answer is very likely yes. If you never go near ticks then maybe not.<p>Another way to think about it is if there was a vaccine to stop car accidents that is only 75% effective, is it worth getting the shot even though I’ll still be afraid of car accidents? Absolutely! The shot is unbelievably easy to get  and probably cheap. It doesn’t solve everything, but it is so easy to do it’s hard not to be worth it.

Even if you are, I certainly would not worry to the effect of covering yourself from head to toe on a nature hike.  The stress from your worry, is likely causing the type of inflammation that would prohibit your body&#x27;s natural immune system from attacking a pathogenic bacterium.

            hmm...  we need to compare rates of infection, not raw numbers since only a small number of the population ever received the lime disease vaccine, and both populations reside only in part of the US.<p>In any case, I agree with the underlying point that it&#x27;s a travesty that the vaccine was taken off the market due to fear-mongering and unproven allegations.<p>It&#x27;s a testament to the failure of the judicial system to protect against frivolous lawsuits.

These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints.[170]<p>&gt; Despite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002,[171] in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects.[170][172] The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a &quot;cautionary tale&quot;;[172] an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which &quot;unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.&quot;[25] The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature: &quot;This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.&quot;[170]

Vaccines do not contain beryllium or asbestos. The mRNA vaccines do not even contain mercury or other heavy metals. Mind you, &#x27;none&#x27; means less than a can of tuna. They do not remain in the body for long. None of it.<p>That&#x27;s why people aren&#x27;t too worried, rationally. Long term effects whould have shown already.<p>If you indeed mean COVID, I agree. There may be late long term effects, because of the diffuse organ damage and persistent infections.<p>Of course <i>any</i> strong immune stimulation may slightly increase <i>or decrease</i> the  risk for derailing or aging the immune system. Which may sooner, e.g. autoimmune disease risk, or later, e.g. lymphoma risk, manifest.<p>For COVID it&#x27;s a silly debate, because you will get infected or vaccinated in any case.

            The claim was that in some individuals the vaccine caused an auto-immune reaction.  It seems to me that anyone who had that problem would have developed the same problem if they got the disease.

            As a US new england-er, this is game changer for walking through woods.<p>For those un-informed, on a walk through any woods, you should always wear high socks, and do a full body check for ticks after.<p>Deer ticks can be as small as a few grains of sand, and near undetectable if they latch on unless you have sharp eyes.<p>Obviously they can transmit lymes.<p>I had a close encounter a few years ago, but very luckily giant rings appeared around the bite site, making it a very easy diagnosis.<p>That only happens in 30% of cases though. The rest likely have no idea, and over time the disease will work it&#x27;s way into your nervous system, causing permanent damage if not treated quickly enough.

I was bitten 10+ years ago - had to pull it off, though it hadn&#x27;t been there long as it hadn&#x27;t latched on deeply yet - it did cause a small ring; I did get and take short course of antibiotics immediately after as far as I remember.<p>I&#x27;ve heard common bloodwork done is very poor at detecting it but is there a better or sure way of detecting it?

            The article states that Lyme disease is only transmitted if the tic latches on for over 36 hours. The bacteria is latent in the tic&#x27;s gut until blood is ingested, at which point it takes 36 hours for the bacteria to multiply and migrate to the tic&#x27;s salivary glands.

She said the pragmatic approach is too treat it as if it was Lyme and take antibiotics. It&#x27;s better to take some antibiotics than wait for the symptoms (which are not always easy to assign to lyme).

            There&#x27;s no definitive accredited lab check as far as I know. At least here in Germany the official serologic tests for late stage Lyme can come back negative for years until the disease really progresses badly - even cerebrospinal fluid results may be normal despite neurological symptoms. My specialist uses elispot lab tests for Borrelia b. OspA, antigen and LFA-1 markers.<p>Other practitioners use westernblot lab results and differential diagnosis.

            Not exactly sure. I made an appointment. First time I&#x27;ve done that. It may just be a &quot;put it on the record&quot; visit, with follow-ups in some months.<p>My relative didn&#x27;t find out, until he had a cantaloupe for a kneecap. They tested the fluid, and found lots of Lyme.<p>He&#x27;s always getting bit. Deer pass through his backyard, on a regular.<p>He said the treatment was anticlimactic. A course of oral antibiotics.

            Recovery with Lyme isn’t always forever. It apparently goes into remission and comes back later. Not sure if anyone knows why or how it does that. AFAIK it is only cured if treated very quickly, before the blood tests are accurate.

            I would get this vaccine yesterday if it were available.<p>Shit, if I were planning on spending a lot of time in the woods (like, more than I already do), I would go to a vet and see if they would give me the one that&#x27;s for dogs. Untreated Lyme messes people up.<p>A whole bunch of people I knew who thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2010 got Lyme. I did not get it, but I don&#x27;t think I was appreciably more cautious than the people I directly knew who did. Part of what makes Lyme scary is the randomness of who gets it and how easy it is to not know you&#x27;ve contracted it.<p>Fortunately, hikers are at least generally aware that it&#x27;s a possibility and know to seek treatment for it specifically. Awareness in the general population is probably still much lower.<p>P.S. Hello from WRJ, VT, fellow New Englander!

            I think the “on the ground” answer varies depending on you, where you are and what insects are around. 70% of deer tick bites may carry Lyme, but the percentage of insect bites with red rings that are Lyme is probably different. If you’re walking through northeast pine forest or low density suburban woods, assume Lyme!<p>Red rings from bites are not uncommon in general. I know I get a reaction from horse flies that looks to professionals like a potential deer tick bite with Lyme.

            Those of us who just went through the &quot;Brood X&quot; cicada emergence are now going through a glut of something called &quot;oak mites&quot;, which apparently feed on the cicada eggs, but also just get everywhere. They are kind of like chiggers, burrowing under the skin, and are too small to see with the naked eye. The &quot;bites&quot; are particularly itchy and can also cause red splotching that may appear ring-like sometimes. I had a minor freak-out the first time I saw a splotch on my 3-yr-old&#x27;s back, but it didn&#x27;t spread and the blotchiness actually went away rather quickly. Luckily, these welts don&#x27;t seem to last as long as mosquito bites.<p>Also, a tick-bite splotch doesn&#x27;t always have to be ring-shaped.

            Being wrong is the essence of science.<p>By contrast, lyme disease is (1) more than 40 years old, (2) not contagious, and (3) has no political headwinds. There is little reason to distrust CDC on this.

            Several states felt it was necessary to pass laws regarding Lyme and provide immunity to physicians willing to treat long haul covid...errr long haul lyme patients.<p>Seems rather naive to presume they had to pass new laws because Lyme has no political headwinds.

            I was able to substantiate your comment about the laws being changed in two California bills (2013 AB1278 and 2005 AB592) amending BPC 2234.1 that appears to relax restrictions about treatment of &quot;persistent&quot; Lyme disease.<p>I do not think it is relevant to the point in this thread that is discussing whether Lyme disease does or does not result in a bullseye rash (Erythema Migrans or EM), and the CDC claiming that in 70-80% of cases the rash is present, which you baselessly disputed and edited your comment to accuse those of downvoting &quot;facts&quot;.<p>As an example of what &quot;evidence&quot; might be, a 2009 paper [1] in <i>Current Problems in Dermatology</i> refers:<p>&gt;  EM is by far the most frequent manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. In the USA, more than 70% of patients registered with Lyme borreliosis had EM [28]. Among 1,471 patients shown to have Lyme borreliosis in an epidemiologic study in southern Sweden, EM was seen in 77% of all cases, and was accompanied by other signs of the disease such as nervous system involvement, arthritis, lymphocytoma and&#x2F;or carditis in only 6.5% [29]<p>You can dispute those referred studies if you wish, but I think it would be hard to argue that CDC&#x27;s statement that Lyme disease is characterized by EM in 70-80% of cases is untrue.<p>[1] Strle, F., &amp; Stanek, G.

            You should provide evidence, and when you go back and edit your response to do so, that evidence should be relevant to the discussion at hand.<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference between data on a disease that&#x27;s been studied for over 40 years, vs one that&#x27;s only been around for a few months.<p>If you think the CDC got it&#x27;s facts wrong on Lyme disease, it&#x27;s as simple as saying &quot;This source disagrees&quot;, and provide the source.  Jumping to the conclusion that your unnamed source is more accurate than any other is another problem itself.

            My experience with ticks: Closer to the home is where you&#x27;re going to find the small ones. I&#x27;ve had two on me. First one was easy to spot it looked like a freckle on my knee. The second one I felt the bite (thought it was an itch) and it was on my inner thigh. Not sure if I would have noticed the second one if it wasn&#x27;t for its haphazard bite. Both latched on when I was in &#x2F; near the garden.

            I go hiking a lot in the Hudson area of New York and have my concerns about ticks too.
As you said, tall sock are recommended. I also use permethrin on all my lower items of clothing including shoes. 
I sometimes also use Off on my exposed skin areas and then check for ticks after my hikes.<p>My wife was once bitten by something through her pants. That left a small ring. I do doubt it was a tick though.<p>My sister on the other hand was bitten by something a few years ago, she thinks it was a spider. There were multiple red rings extending far and she started having other reactions and needed hospitalization.
They pumped her so full of anti-biotics(was on a drip for days), it left her digestive system screwy for months but at least she does not have Lyme disease now.

            I&#x27;m convinced you can become and&#x2F;or grow immune to Lyme, though. It&#x27;s purely anecdotal.<p>I grew up where we built our house (deep, deep in the woods). I spent my childhood on the farm there. Ticks were a constant menace, I honestly don&#x27;t know how many hundreds I pulled off myself as a child.<p>When I was able, my spouse and I purchased it and built a house. 6 months after moving in, my spouse developed Lymes disease. I have no explanation, other than I am immune to the ticks in the area (or I have had it my entire life with zero symptoms maybe?).

            When you were young, those ticks may not have had lyme. More importantly, you removed them. They have to be attached for 24 hours before the bacteria comes back out of the tick&#x27;s gut.

            A few houses ago we lived on 2.5 heavily wooded acres in a tick endemic area. Probably got 30 ticks on me from working in the woods.<p>Never got Lyme disease though by following what you said - check for ticks at the end of each day. It really is true… if they are latched for less than 36 hours you are good.<p>My son on the other hand had Lyme disease when he was about 6 with a found tick followed by obvious bulls eye rash in the middle of his back. The one time we didn’t check him at end of the day… 30 days of amoxicillin and he’s been fine the past seven years.

            Which lyme carrying species are you comparing? For Ixodes scapularis compared to Ixodes ricinus I see adult female sizes of 2.5 mm vs 3.6 mm. Not a huge difference. Are you sure you&#x27;re not comparing larvae or nymphs to adults or even gorged adults?

            I know this is about Lyme disease, but let me add another word of caution while we are discussing ticks.  Two years ago I was bit by the Lone Star tick. Since that time I developed an allergy to all red meat. It was hard to diagnose and a few of the doctors I worked with along the years still don’t believe its true.  If your interested in learning more search for Alpha Gal.  There is an excellent Radio Lab podcast about it.

However, when you’re having legitimate symptoms and your own doctor tries to deny the symptoms without offering further diagnostics, it’s time to cut ties and move on.<p>It can take a few tries to find a good doctor.

            I&#x27;ve generally had better experiences with DOs than MDs when it comes to listening and working with me to understand how and what I feel.

So just something to keep in mind if you&#x27;re unhappy with your current doctor.<p>edit: For those not aware, a DO is fully licensed to practice medicine (in the US at least), no different from an MD.

            I was bit by a tick in 2010. I pulled it off my forearm and it left a protrusion that lasted about 2 weeks. No rings. I got sick with a flu around this time. Went to the doctor, the lyme test came back negative.<p>Shortly after this I started to develop lesions in my mouth and scalp. Then they spread to my entire body. 6 months later got a diagnosis of an autoimmune blistering disease. The specialist said it was a usually a disease for old people, very unusual for an otherwise healthy 35 year old to develop it. 8 years of oral antibiotics and some steroids for flare ups and I was in remission.<p>In my opinion, everyone should be leery of tick bites.

            We, as patients, pass around these apocryphal stories around, but don&#x27;t look at the opposite experience of doctors. Doctors constantly, and I mean multiple times per day, get patients in that tell them their symptoms are due to disease or condition or complex X. Time and again, the patient is completely wrong. No, you don&#x27;t have cancer, your lymph node hurts because it is fighting off an infection, and besides if it was cancer, the node wouldn&#x27;t hurt. No, you don&#x27;t have lyme disease, you&#x27;re sore because you started gardening again and you are 50. No, you don&#x27;t have an ulcer, you&#x27;re just eating too much ice cream before going to bed.<p>As humans, we forget about the times we were wrong, and also don&#x27;t share those stories. &quot;I went to the doctor thinking I was dying of cancer, but it turns out I&#x27;m allergic to mushrooms&quot; is much less likely to be passed around as a story than, &quot;No doctors would listen to me until one did and tested me and found out I have Lyme disease.&quot;

            Hilarious you brought this up: &quot;No, you don&#x27;t have an ulcer, you&#x27;re just eating too much ice cream before going to bed.&quot;<p>Reflux is a very common food allergy symptom and milk is one of the most common allergen, if not THE most common.<p>I&#x27;ve had 3 or 4 scopes that showed some mild inflammation, and GIs were simply lost. I&#x27;ve managed to locate a 90 year old allergist who probably began practicing before there was benadryl. After recounting the symptoms I was told &quot;it&#x27;s milk. it&#x27;s always milk&quot;. I was taken aback, how can anyone be so sure? Literally 5 minutes later that was confirmed by a skin-prick test.<p>Most physicians are garbage. The allergist was quite thorough.<p>The billing rate to dismiss you in 30 seconds pays about the same as a 30 min appointment. The incentives just aren&#x27;t there.

            I agree with the systemic problem that our healthcare system doesn&#x27;t want to get to the bottom of symptoms. It drives me crazy, especially the &quot;most cancer is treatable if caught early, but no we won&#x27;t give you a diagnostic test to actually catch cancer early&quot;. I have direct experience with this, pushing through multiple doctors that ended with my thyroid cancer diagnosis.<p>My doctor at the time was actually really good, not because he was good at diagnosing, but he had enough experience to recognize his inability to do so and would always send me to an expert. He literally was 100% wrong about all of my major diagnoses (my hurt knee actually was a torn ACL, my abdominal pain actually was a hernia, my throat nodule actually was cancer), but he always sent me to a specialist to be sure. And he knew really good specialists. &quot;I don&#x27;t think it is X, but lets have a specialist verify&quot; was his common refrain.<p>But, yeah, the system sucks now.

            A doctor&#x27;s opinion on disease isn&#x27;t merely an opinion, it&#x27;s an educated guess based on experience and qualifications. New diseases and research are constantly appearing, thousands of articles are written each year. We can&#x27;t expect doctors to know everything, but we can expect them to have more informed opinions, on average, than non-doctors.<p>I say this because there&#x27;s a rising trend of anti-intellectualism and distrust of doctors in the US, which leads to massive self inflicted wounds in Covid and vaccines. Doctors aren&#x27;t infallible, but they&#x27;re far better than random online sources.

            That doesn&#x27;t mean distrust of vaccination in general - at least by doctors.  It was for a potential bioterrorist attack.

            If you assume the low likelyhood of the attack was the reason, that means 90% of those physicians could be lying. The stated reason for refusal was concerns about side effects. It&#x27;s in the quote.<p>What you stated as a fact, 96% vaccination rate, is actually a self-reported survey.<p>Why do a survey when public health CDC records could simply be matched with the physician licensing registrars?<p>Seems an automatic search like that would save physicians their valuable time, aren&#x27;t they very busy with a pandemic right now?

            It&#x27;s always cost-benefit. Relative risk of side effect directly relates to likelihood.<p>Risk of side effects vs benefit of vaccine.<p>I am not likely to take an HIV vaccine, since my personal chance of contracting HIV is incredibly low.  So any side effect isn&#x27;t &quot;worth it&quot; -- even a sore arm. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m anti-vaccine.<p>I also don&#x27;t wear a bullet proof vest around because it&#x27;s too heavy (&quot;side effect&quot;). Does that mean I&#x27;m anti-bullet proof vest?  No.  But I would wear a bullet proof vest in a war zone -- even if it&#x27;s heavy.<p>If there was a widespread small pox outbreak in the U.S., I&#x27;m certain more than 10% of physicians would take the vaccine. Does that mean they were lying before?  No.

            did you read my comment?<p>covid 96% status is from an anonymous survey.<p>Why not just get CDC to provide actual hard data? Surely they keep vaccination records?<p>Should vaccination status of physician, as verified by the CDC, be public data?

            <i>The stated reason for refusal was concerns about side effects.</i><p>As another comment already mentioned, smallpox vaccines (at least historically) tended to have undesirable side effects, like permanent scars.  Smallpox vaccination is probably not a good proxy for vaccination overall.

            I&#x27;d qualify that:  &quot;...we can expect them to have more informed opinions, on average, _for any random condition_, than non-doctors.&quot;<p>The thing I think you&#x27;re missing is that the resources to do good, deep research on a condition do exist, and the sufferer has very strong motivation to do that research and become very well informed in the etiology and treatment options. The doctor, less so.  They have a lot of patients and a lot of demands on their time.<p>Will a good doctor put in the effort, do the research, and come up with a superior treatment plan?  Certainly!  But not all doctors will do this.<p>If you use the allegory of the pig and the chicken, the sufferer is the pig, the doctor is the chicken.  It is reasonable that the average pig will put in more work and be better informed about their own condition than the average chicken.

            The English language has a serious deficiency in the term &quot;research&quot;.<p>You can do &quot;research&quot; by spending your days in a lab, formulating hypotheses, doing experiments, reading related academic work, drawing conclusions, publishing their findings.<p>You can do &quot;research&quot; by googling, reading blog posts and wikipedia articles, watching Youtube videos, following telegram links and possibly reading a popular-science book.<p>These two things are very different activities and produce very different bodies of knowledge. &quot;Do your own research!&quot; is a common sentiment in Covid skeptic circles. It doesn&#x27;t mean being in a lab. It means following links in your Google bubble. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily produce useful knowledge. Properly trained researchers are aware of things like confirmation bias, selection bias, recollection bias. The &quot;I did my own research crowd&quot; is not and suffers seriously from it.<p>Using the term with the doctor is blurring the line between both versions. They don&#x27;t stand in the lab and &quot;do their own research&quot;, but they are more educated in the medical field than the common patient and have context.

            “Chronic Lyme” is a very challenging topic because it has become a mix of legitimate symptoms (those suffering post-treatment Lyme disease) but also a pseudoscience catch-all diagnosis promoted by bad alternative medicine practitioners.<p>Contrary to popular belief, the CDC and medical community do actually continue to research the topics of potential Lyme persistence and post-treatment Lyme symptoms. We’re discussing this under the headline about a new Lyme disease vaccine, aren’t we?<p>However, there is also an out of control pseudoscience&#x2F;quackery community that has attached itself to Lyme as the go-to explanation for unexplained symptoms. They’re drawn to the theories of Lyme persisting in undetectable ways, which they use as an excuse to diagnose people by vague symptoms alone. There are now a number of well-known scam Lyme disease labs that claim to use proprietary techniques to identify Lyme disease that the reputable labs can’t catch. Virtually everyone who submits a sample to these scammy labs comes back with a “positive” result.<p>I once tested positive for Lyme using the CDC criteria from a reputable mainstream lab. The specialists I saw <i>did not</i> mess around with treatment as well as follow up, but they did go to great lengths to ensure I wasn’t trying to get in with a pseudoscience or self-diagnosed “chronic Lyme” case. One of them explained that she was inundated with appointment requests from people who self-diagnosed as “chronic Lyme” after reading Internet forums despite multiple negative test results and refused to believe any other explanation. The “chronic Lyme” online communities are a terrible mess of misinformation, but the actual medical community around Lyme treatment is quietly continuing to do good work. It can be difficult to separate the two from the outside due to all of the noise made by the pseudoscience quacks that have attached themselves to the topic.

            That&#x27;s fair. But I&#x27;d rather humor the quackish side of chronic lyme and see some progress being made, rather than lean to the side of dismissing them, along with people with legitimate complaints.<p>The inability to adequately assay Lyme speaks more to how bad we are at assaying diseases, than to the (il-)legitimacy of the disease.

            &gt; But I&#x27;d rather humor the quackish side of chronic lyme and see some progress being made,<p>That would have the opposite effect, because many (or likely most) of them never actually had Lyme disease.<p>That’s the problem: “Chronic Lyme” has attracted too many pseudoscience practitioners who lazily blame everything on undetectable Lyme. They diagnose based on symptoms alone and&#x2F;or employ tests with known extreme false positive rates while dismissing mainstream tests that have been validated.<p>The more you mix those false patients into the real Lyme population, the more you dilute the real signal from actual patients.<p>Humoring the quackery doesn’t advance the science.<p>If you want progress to be made in a field, it’s important to be diligent about keeping the quackery out.

            The issue with humoring the quackish side of chronic lyme is that you swiftly get into supposed treatments that are, in fact, quackery or can be actively harmful to patients (such as extremely long antibiotic treatments). So you risk both wasting money and harming people by humoring stuff you know is nonsense.

            A lot of it is just science catching up to what is observed in the real world. I agree that many practicing doctors are operating on out-of-date knowledge, so if you happen on one of those and start talking about CFS, you might not get a positive reaction. Isn&#x27;t it the same as unknowingly hiring a bad contractor, though? Doesn&#x27;t mean that the engineering community is not trying to find more efficient and better ways of construction. CFS is a recognized disorder by the medical community, although the causes are unkown. That is not surprising considering the complexity of the human body.<p>Tick-borne illnesses are talked about a lot in Europe, ever since I was a kid (~20 years ago). Can&#x27;t say I have received much conflicting information in all those years.

            &gt; CFS is a recognized disorder by the medical community, although the causes are unkown.<p>My point was, it wasn&#x27;t even a recognized disorder until fairly recently. As I understand it, part of the problem is a cottage industry of quackish medicine sprung up around the unfalsifiability of chronic Lyme and CFS. But instead of the medical community taking an agnostic stance &quot;we see you are suffering but we can&#x27;t explain it&quot;, there was a strong push in the opposite direction, asserting that it&#x27;s psychosomatic &#x2F; &quot;only in your head&quot; &#x2F; &quot;here&#x27;s some antidepressants.&quot; And you see this pattern again and again. I think the dismissive attitude is starting to abate among the younger medical professionals but you still see this air of &quot;anything I wasn&#x27;t trained on isn&#x27;t a thing&quot; among many of them.

            &gt; there was a strong push in the opposite direction, asserting that it&#x27;s psychosomatic &#x2F; &quot;only in your head&quot; &#x2F; &quot;here&#x27;s some antidepressants.&quot;<p>As a counterpoint to this, my first exposure to chronic fatigue syndrome came while I was dealing with depression and getting psychotherapy for the first time.  CFS popped up in the news, and a friend guided me to a web forum where I&#x27;d get the &quot;unfiltered&quot; version from people who suffered from it.  What jumped out to me about that community, given my struggle with depression at the time, was that it was a cesspool of stigma against mental illness.  The experiences people reported varied over a wide spectrum, but there was a significant contingent of people with classic symptoms of depression along with the vague physical complaints that most people have, outraged that doctors would be so insulting as to suggest depression or other psychological explanations.  If there was one belief that united the community, one shared credo, it was that they deserved a physical diagnosis because their dignity required it, and they would not accept a psychological diagnosis because it would render them unworthy of sympathy.  One person summed up the consensus succinctly by saying it was an outrage for doctors to suggest that they were &quot;just too lazy and too stupid to get their lives together.&quot;  That was unwelcome, but valuable, confirmation of how some people saw depression, and it made me more guarded about when and how I talked about it.<p>So it cuts both ways.  I&#x27;m sure there are doctors who arrogantly label any patient they can&#x27;t figure out as &quot;crazy,&quot; but I&#x27;m just as sure there are patients who overreact, angrily, to any mention of psychological causes or treatments.

            I caught Lyme earlier this year.  Recently moved to upstate NY (20 miles from Lyme, CT) and tick checks are a daily thing.  Found an adult embedded in my side.  Developed a 103ºF fever and fatigue.  Dr. took blood for the Lyme test but didn&#x27;t wait for a positive and prescribed 2 weeks of Doxycycline.<p>A few days later I found a bullseye rash on my leg (not near the bite area) which pretty much confirmed it.<p>I felt 100% around 5-7 days after developing fever symptoms.

            Ionizing radiation. Ingenious approach, sort of a pseudo-vaccine, kills and breaks apart a pathogen in the blood that was taken and when re-injected it presents a greater attack surface for the immune system to learn about the pathogen.

            Thanks for highlighting this. While most hikers are aware of the dangers of Lyme disease, the encephalitis is less well-known. I only found out about it while hiking in Slovakia a few years ago. At that stage, the hiking trip had started and it was too late to get a vaccine.

            My area has a relatively high infection rate, but most people I know aren&#x27;t vaccinated, even if they&#x27;re somewhat aware of the dangers. Having a vaccine is not enough, you also need people to use it.

            The deer themselves are a problem in the northeast. They are greatly overpopulated and eat the native understory, preventing the next generation of trees from growing past adolescence. As the existing trees slowly die, there will be none younger to replace them.<p>This also clears out the competition to the benefit of non-native plants, which the deer don&#x27;t eat. Some of these plants are invasive, such as japanese barberry, and render large areas untraversable. Not to mention the bramble is an excellent home for rodents, another major tick carrier.<p>If you want to reduce ticks, deer are a critical element of their lifecycle.

            It depends on a number of factors. Access is a huge one where I&#x27;m at. Public lands can be basically hunted out while the deer have moved onto private lands where nobody hunts and created huge herds (30+).<p>If your area doesn&#x27;t have the access issue, then I would guess it could be an issue with the number of hunters - if there aren&#x27;t enough, then they can&#x27;t harvest the number required to bring down the population (or the limits make it difficult - seems like that&#x27;s the case the way they handle doe permits). Many states have a program that allows hunters to donate their deer to a food bank through a participating butcher. This can make a big impact in areas that allow more harvests (MD allows 10 doe per year&#x2F;season without any special permits).

            Coyotes have been introduced in the east in the past. They generally don&#x27;t kill healthy adult deer (maybe), but they do kill a decent number of fawns. They aren&#x27;t enough to fully control the population, especially in the suburbs.<p>The advantage of going after the mice is that they can use crispr to give them immunity. It could be used on deer, but would probably have more push back. Tick tubes have already been shown to be effective at the small mammal level.<p>It will likely require a combination to control.

            Yep, coyotes are not pack hunters in the way that wolves are.<p>Interestingly, the coyotes in the US East are apparently hybrid &quot;coywolves&quot;. They are larger than western coyotes, but still not big enough to take down an adult deer, and they still do not hunt in packs.<p>If you have a large area to cover, Tick Tubes(tm) can get expensive.

            There is no comparison between the organizational coherence of coyotes (or coywolves) and full wolves.<p>Wolves are bigger, stronger, and cooperative in larger packs. Coyotes are more opportunistic and ad hoc, and easily scared off.<p>The net is that wolves have far more success with large prey.<p>Feral (or wandering) domesticated dogs will sometimes hunt together too, but their coordination is limited. Wolves are impressive creatures.

            In my area there are over 120 deer per square mile currently. This number was historically 10, when predators existed. Studies have shown that around 30 deer per square mile is when biodiversity starts to suffer.<p>I live in the forest and manage my lot with guidance from foresters and nearby park rangers. It may take a hundred years for these current trees to die, but there&#x27;s nothing to replace them. You can walk the understory and see knee-high trees that can&#x27;t grow further because the deer prune their leaves.

            120 deer per square mile?!<p>In thought the moose problem in Sweden was big. That is just ridiculous. We have a moose population that is waaay higher than ever before because we killed most large predators, and the people responsible for keeping the population down (hunters) want a much larger population than is environmentally defensible.

            There&#x27;s nothing unethical with culling an overpopulated species. We do it to deer, wolves, etc. all the time via hunting permits.<p>As long as wild biology subsists on killing and eating, there&#x27;s no problem with humans doing the same in order to restore balance.<p>It also helps to reintroduce natural predators when possible. But in absence of that strategy, humans can do the job too.

            This article gives me hope. My grandfather has Lyme disease and it took a very long time to identify, he’s very old and spends a lot of time outdoors, so the disease has made life much harder. I live in an area with a lot of white tailed deer. I get at least 600 on my property a year, as it’s a highly trafficked area with a lot of bedding and running water. Last winter my wife had one embedded in her that I had to pull out, and I immediately got worried about Lyme disease. Every day around 5pm a baby doe comes to our backyard to eat some greens and I receive my reminder that the summer season is coming to a close and ticks may become rampant again.<p>More than anything, I hope we can improve our identification of this disease, a vaccine would absolutely be a game changer, if they can make it happen.

            TBE is another terrible tick borne neurological disease that’s increasing rapidly, currently only in Eurasia. There’s no cure, but at least a decent vaccine.

            While it might turn deadly, there are many asymptomatic cases, too, so it&#x27;s not like Ebola or something.<p>One should still get the vaccine when living in or traveling to an affected area and plans to go into nature, though. When I was last vaccinated it took 3 months for the vaccine to reach ~70% efficacy after 2 shots and 12 more months to reach 99% efficacy after 3 shots, so people should not wait until they travel to get it.

            The article seems to indicate that consensus does not support Chronic Lyme Disease, instead preferring Post Treatment Lyme Disease as a pathology (which doesn&#x27;t seem unlikely if the disease causes nervous system damage). It also mentions reinfection has been recorded. I&#x27;m only really seeing one data point being posted to counter that idea, and that doesn&#x27;t seem to exclude the reinfection scenario.<p>I guess the hope for promoters of CLD would be that it&#x27;s possible to treat the currently irreversible PTLD symptoms using antibiotics, rather than accept something akin to a fibromyalgia diagnosis.

            Ah, I didn&#x27;t see that this was strictly a comment about chronic Lyme. It seems pretty well settled, but that single conflicting case does leave the door open for further study, even if only to determine how a fluke happened.

            I had recently read a paper by a professor in Stanford Psychiatry that made very exaggerated claims that would go on to not be replicated to the degree originally made, which I had expected as the treatment used was not a major improvement on the existing methods and that researchers from even prestigious universities might be incentivized to not investigate or report the full truth if they might benefit from it in some way.<p>While it&#x27;s interesting that the treatment was &quot;successful&quot; and that symptoms continued, this isn&#x27;t really a strong statement of support for something like Chronic Lyme Disease or at least its widespread presentation - much more likely a statement of support for Lyme Disease bacteria not always being treated by the regimen, or potentially even that it&#x27;s easy for someone to get a second infection and have no significant immunity.

            I know where you&#x27;re coming from. I believe it is the appropriate attitude in discussing misinformation with, for example, covid.<p>BUT I really did do my own research with respect to Lyme, reading deeply into the peer-reviewed literature, and I came to the conclusion that the &quot;scientific consensus&quot; was formed by people too lazy or misguided to read it themselves.<p>For example, the consensus was that Lyme couldn&#x27;t persist in humans after antibiotic treatment. But it DOES persist in other animals including primates. They could easily discover that because they could euthanize those other animals to see if it was there in their tissues, and it was. They couldn&#x27;t do that with humans. The conclusion is OBVIOUSLY not that it can&#x27;t happen in humans, but rather that we haven&#x27;t proved it could. The &quot;scientific consensus&quot; got those outcomes confused, and assumed it couldn&#x27;t.<p>But consider this quote from the OP article: &quot;In May, her research team published their strongest evidence to date of persistent Lyme symptoms. In a unique finding, they discovered Lyme bacteria in the tissues of a deceased 69-year-old woman who contracted the disease, was treated multiple times with antibiotics, and still couldn’t clear the infection from her body.”<p>I was impressed by related evidence a couple years ago, such as an examination of the brains of people who had died of Alzheimer&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t remember the exact number, but something like 25% of those brains contained Lyme spirochetes. Note that there is a theory gaining traction recently that Alzheimer&#x27;s is caused by the brain&#x27;s attempts to manage active infections.<p>There is much, much more to say, and a LOT of research that goes in the opposite direction of what you&#x27;re assuming in your post.<p>An anecdote: researchers tested hundreds of FDA-approved drugs in test tubes to see which ones worked best at killing Lyme spirochetes. Disulfiram won. My wife, who had lost her career as a retinal surgeon and researcher due to a chronic illness we thought might be chronic Lyme, took disulfiram under the care of her doctor who had treated Lyme patients for decades, and who was one of the first to try disulfiram in patients.<p>After the treatment, her illness disappeared. Our older son also had the same illness, which led to him taking a year off from school because he just couldn&#x27;t function. He had been taking antibiotics for a couple years. At one point we stopped the antibiotics, and he felt great for a week, worse the next week, and in week 3 he was all the way back to being pretty nonfunctional with the symptoms attributed to &quot;chronic Lyme&quot;. He, too, took disulfiram and was cured.<p>Note that we had long spent summers on Little Deer Isle, Maine, known for its deer and deer ticks.

            A decade ago Lyme disease landed me in the hospital with carditis and neurological issues.

My post was about the question of whether chronic Lyme actually exists, not whether taking disulfiram is a good idea.<p>Both my wife and son had a VERY difficult time with the disulfiram treatment. My son, in particular, ended up in the ER one night, basically having a psychotic break. That was the day he stopped taking the disulfiram.<p>BUT it happens that he was almost at the end of the recommended treatment duration anyway, and EVERY indication is that both he and my wife were completely cured by it. This was probably about 2 years ago, and so it&#x27;s very encouraging that there is no evidence of any recurrence.<p>As I mentioned, my wife and son were early in the treatment experiments, and they had high doses. The doctor who treated them has now treated a good number of people and has much more experience with different doses. With a lower dose for the same amount of time, cures are less reliable. But there are experiments with low doses for longer times.<p>I worry that you may have Lyme spirochetes in your brain that may predispose you to Alzheimer&#x27;s.

            I think the key thing is that it disproves the idea that the bacteria which cause the disease are reliably eliminated by antibiotics, which is typically a key point that those in the &quot;it&#x27;s not cause by lyme&quot; camp rely on.<p>Doesn&#x27;t prove that it is lyme, but it shifts the balance of probablities considerably.

            The human study was literally done because denial of chronic lyme persisted despite multiple reliable studies in animal models.<p>It&#x27;s quite disgusting and begets further questions as to why such attitudes towards Lyme exist in the first place.

            Most CDC &#x2F; IDSA folks will tell you that a course of antibiotics will rid the body of Lyme in all cases. The presence of spirochetes here should be enough for them to stop using that language. But it likely won&#x27;t because there appears to be a systemic organizational bias against Lyme as a chronic condition, and I&#x27;m not sure why.

            Inter_netuser: That Frontiers paper is about as reliable as Big Foot hunters claiming they finally found him. The authors Brian Fallon and Monica Embers have been trying to prove chronic Lyme beliefs for many years.<p>They are funded by their antiscience movement:

The paper is consistent with someone who had lyme disease (a not-uncommon illness) and then years later was diagnosed with dementia, but you can&#x27;t say Lyme caused the dementia.<p>There is a scientific consensus against chronic Lyme based on decades of research.<p>It&#x27;s disturbing that chronic Lyme has become a dangerous social phenomenon based on conspiracy theories, fake diagnoses, and fake treatments.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecut.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;what-happens-when-lyme-disease-becomes-an-identity.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecut.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;what-happens-when-lyme-diseas...</a>

            The recalcitrance of the broader medical research community to acknowledge that spirochetes can persist after antibiotics and continue to wreak havoc, is truly astounding. You&#x27;d think after all the &quot;whoops, my bad&quot; moments in history - handwashing, thalidomide, GRID&#x2F;AIDS, to name a few, they would learn to be a bit more conservative in their stance, e.g. &quot;we have not found <i>direct</i> evidence of chronic Lyme, but it has a plausible mechanism and widespread reports.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve already seen the needle shift from &quot;Lyme is impossible after antibiotics&quot; to &quot;well I guess some cases escape first round of treatment.&quot;

            I think a good test for Lyme disease would be more important than a vaccine (which is welcome too if it works well). The problem with Lyme disease is that it&#x27;s symptoms are very wide and generic, and the commonly used tests are not very reliable. This means that many people live with the disease not aware of it, while others self-diagnose Lyme disease and cure it even if they didn&#x27;t have it (because they had symptoms like longterm brain fog).

            I&#x27;m not sure why this is getting downvoted. Testing for lyme really is pretty unreliable. Given how hard it is to reliably test for, we really don&#x27;t have a good grasp on how prevalent lyme infections are.<p>Another thing that would great, in addition to a vaccine and better testing, is prevention. Infected ticks are way more wide spread than they used to be. I&#x27;ve heard various reasons for this, including habitat loss of all kinds of animals. Simple measures can help, like eating more deer, or letting chickens roam free in high-tick areas.

            I don&#x27;t understand why there would be a problem testing for borreliosis. It&#x27;s caused by the borrelia spirochete, which is almost identical to syphilis. The variant of borrelia that causes relapsing fever was one of the very first causative micro-organisms diagnosed because it it so obvious under a low-power microscope. Surely the variant of borrelia named after a town in New England should be as easy to diagnose: if you have the spirochete you have the infection, otherwise you don&#x27;t.<p>Granted I&#x27;m just a rando on the internet and not an expert in infections diseases. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve diagnosed with and successfully treated for Lyme disease. I still get dozens of tick bites a year. A reliable test would be a boon for people like me.

            We keep chickens and I can tell you a domestic chicken roaming free in a high tick area would be gone in a few days. Hawks, foxes, raccoons, coyotes, whatever. They&#x27;re domesticated and flightless.<p>What you want is guinea hens. They&#x27;re voracious tick eaters. And will hide in trees, etc. at night. But also noisy as hell, and will walk all over roads.<p>Wild turkeys eat a lot of ticks, so we should be encouraging them.<p>Northern bobwhite quail are a native (to north america) quail which eat a lock of ticks. But they&#x27;re near-threatened and very few of them in the wild and they also don&#x27;t go as far north as New England (we have them here in Ontario but sparsely)

            As the article describes, the story is more complicated than that:<p><i>&gt; Despite its shortcomings, Lymerix was initially popular. By July 2000, more than one million doses had been distributed. But safety concerns eventually sank the vaccine. While the FDA panel that approved Lymerix did so unanimously, several members wondered whether the vaccine might cause an autoimmune reaction leading to arthritis. A section of OspA resembles a human protein that modulates the immune response, and the concern of some on the FDA panel was that, after vaccination, the immune system would overcorrect and fight off not only the OspA protein that covered the bacteria, but also that human protein. Nothing like this occurred in Lymerix’s clinical trials.<p>&gt; Shortly after Lymerix hit the market, those worries emerged nonetheless. Some recipients reported joint pain and arthritis, symptoms they blamed on the vaccine itself. The FDA found only 59 such adverse events out of 1.4 million doses administered, and did not find direct scientific evidence that the Lyme vaccine had caused them. Still, the questions over possible unintended effects were enough to dampen enthusiasm, especially after 121 Lymerix recipients filed a class-action lawsuit against the vaccine’s manufacturer. SmithKline Beecham, projecting sales of only 10,000 doses in 2002, decided to withdraw Lymerix from the market in February of that year. (The lawsuit was settled one year later, with more than $1 million paid out by the pharmaceutical company to cover the prosecuting lawyers’ fees, but no financial compensation was awarded to the plaintiffs.)</i><p>The new treatment in development avoids the problem by directly injecting antibodies instead of stimulating the immune system to create the antibodies as Lymerix did.

            I&#x27;m a bit confused here... I thought a vaccine that protected you from Lyme disease already existed? I grew up in Latvia, and it was pretty common to get that jab. You have to get boosters every 5 years or so (which I haven&#x27;t really done since I moved away) but they&#x27;re supposed to protect you from the encephalitis ticks? Sorry if the terminology is wrong here.<p>I was surprised to know that they didn&#x27;t bother with that in the UK. Then I got even more surprised when I learned that there&#x27;s actually a lot of ticks in Scotland. I don&#x27;t understand why this isn&#x27;t spoken about more. Back at school they taught you at primary school what to do if ou het bitten, how to take it out, where to bring it for tests etc.

            There used to be a human vaccine for Lyme, but it was pulled from market about 20 years ago. Interestingly, this Lyme vaccine was one of the first victims of the modern anti-vax movement.

            The new treatment entered Phase 1 trials in January 2020 with 60 participants and the earliest it would be in market is 2024.<p>You have to scroll through 20+ paragraphs before you get to the lede...<p>&quot;Enter Mark Klempner.

            Yes. In my eyes, the original Lyme vaccine was the first casualty of the modern anti-vax movement.<p>They claimed that the vaccine gave them Lyme when really the vaccine gave them an immune response for a few days... as vaccines should. Through a huge amount of media attention they scared away the pharma company, they stopped marketing, sales tanked, the vax was pulled. No medical issues with the vaccine were ever discovered.

            The article covers that but very pointedly doesn&#x27;t bring up the angle.

            Another “tick noob” question. When going hiking in woods I avoid trails where I may “brush” against bushes or twigs or branches etc. In other words prefer wide trails. Would that be an effective way to avoid ticks? Or is there a chance ticks “fly” in the air or are passively transported in the air via wind etc? (I did say I’m a tick noob ;)

            This is fascuinating.  Fortunately I live in a state with very low numbers, both absolute and per-100k, but I was curious about how infections had spread across the country, so I found this data at the CDC:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;lyme&#x2F;stats&#x2F;tables.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;lyme&#x2F;stats&#x2F;tables.html</a><p>The really strange thing is Massachusetts.  In 2010 they had 36.3 confirmed cases per 100k residents--one of the higher rates in the country at that time, but in 2019 they had .1 confirmed cases per 100k, while neighboring states remained high.  I have to assume this isn&#x27;t real or is some kind of artifact (not confirming, just treating?), but I wonder if anyone has any insight into this?

            Based on our experience, with anywhere from 2 to about 15 in a flock, guineas aren&#x27;t super effective at reducing ticks. They&#x27;re also very noisy, leave big turds all over the place, and at least in our rural New England area, serve to attract predators.<p>Our spring &quot;dog tick season&quot; has become intense the last couple of years. At the height of the season this spring the daily tick count from grooming the dog was anywhere from 10 (a light day) to a high of 27 ticks acquired after an hour-long hike. When it&#x27;s this bad, I can pick up four just walking across the front lawn. During that season they&#x27;re mostly not deer ticks, so fortunately they&#x27;re bigger and much easier to find, and at least according to most literature I&#x27;ve seen, dog ticks do not transmit Lyme.

            Edible vaccines are not easy.  There&#x27;s a reason you are still getting injections.<p>Shooting them with darts, well, those would be a hell of a lot more expensive than bullets.  It seems ... fraught with a lot of potential for unexpected effects.

            My grandma just got Lyme with pretty high certainty in her own garden. In suburbia in a million people city. With a deer:people ratio of about 0.00.<p>From my understanding, ticks can be in any type of grass. If you somehow touch grass of any type, be it walking, sitting or hand-mowing, there is a chance of picking one up. Sure, there are few ticks in very populated areas, but I would rather guess that more people equates to more likelyness that someone else already picked up the ticks in that area. And obviously: there is less grass were many people go.

            Ticks are incredibly common where I live (Austria) and so is hiking. In our local &quot;shark tank&quot; show someone pitched a freezing&#x2F;electroporation tool (modified lighter) to remove ticks; I guess [1] is the final product, which sounds pretty interesting IMHO.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help-pen.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help-pen.com</a>

            Took around 5 unlatched ones off me this summer, about 5 more latched and unlatched from my dog and a few off my gf. We live close to a national park. Apparently the dog lyme vaccine is the same as the one that was approved for humans in the 90s. I wanted to buy it and shot myself with it. Theres some folks who say its fine.

            Any reason why this injection of OspA Monoclonal Antibodies wouldn&#x27;t help in late disseminated Lyme disease?.<p>My understanding is that very tough cases of neurological Lyme disease often benefit greatly from IVIG. Wouldn&#x27;t this be a more targeted version of IVIG?

            I&#x27;d rather see treatment than a vaccine. I do believe most cases of Lyme are trivial, but some can linger and cause horrible issues. Disulfiram sounds very promising.

            You&#x27;re oversimplifying the issue which is described in some detail in the article. Yes, the antivax movement is killing thousands of people with their opposition to COVID vaccines, but that doesn&#x27;t mean every vaccine ever studied was good, or that the FDA is infallible.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it was good that Lymerix was pulled from the market.

            If they completed the trials then they&#x27;d have some protection against major lawsuits. But no amount of legal protection would prevent low sales due to widespread public mistrust. Especially at a time when Lyme wasn&#x27;t as rampant and terror-inducing as it is now.

            Because in the US legal system that uses laypeople as judges (&quot;juries&quot;), lawsuits tend to be won by those who put on the best play for the juries, not by those who have the better arguments on their side like in Continental Europe. And to make matters worse, sometimes juries go for obscenely excessive damages against companies to &quot;make a point&quot; - just look at the McDonald&#x27;s coffee case.

            The McDonald’s coffee lawsuit was not frivolous[1][2]. The company served coffee at extremely dangerous temperatures. The claimant had severe third degree burns and only wanted McDonald’s to pay for her medical expenses. McDonald’s had a least 700 complaints about the problem before the lawsuit and did nothing until after the lawsuit.

            No, what happened to Stella Liebeck was terrible, and it&#x27;s right that she had the public&#x27;s sympathy, however her coffee was not excessively hot by modern standards.<p>Stella&#x27;s coffee was served within the temperature range that was, and still is, recommended by professional coffee associations like SCAA and NCA [1].  The NCA recommends that coffee be held and served at around 180-185 deg F (~80-85 deg C), which is likely near the temperature at which Stella was burned.  This is a perfectly reasonable service temperature, widely used by coffee shops, restaurants, and home brewing machines to this day.<p>Stella Liebeck took her cup of coffee and <i>squeezed</i> it between her legs in order to fiddle with the lid.  The result was tragic, but completely expected.  If I spill a fresh cup of Starbucks coffee on my crotch today, I fully expect to sustain third-degree burns.  So I take a little extra care with it until it has cooled to drinking temperature, which happens pretty quickly.<p>Tea is generally even hotter.  Any good tea shop will serve a pot of freshly boiled water, at least twenty degrees hotter than hot coffee.  Spilling that on yourself is guaranteed to melt your skin.  Great care is warranted.<p>Again, what happened to Stella was terrible.  She didn&#x27;t deserve it, and she didn&#x27;t deserve the hate she got afterward.  But she did something really stupid.  I sympathize, because I do stupid stuff <i>all the time</i>, and I have the scars to remind me.<p>We&#x27;re surrounded by extremely dangerous things that require great care to use properly.  It&#x27;s useful for coffee to be held and served hot, just as it&#x27;s useful for knives to be sharp and cars to be able to reach highway speeds.  There will inevitably be accidents, but making the world completely safe for people who use these things carelessly would mean depriving everyone of their proper use.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncausa.org&#x2F;About-Coffee&#x2F;How-to-Brew-Coffee" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncausa.org&#x2F;About-Coffee&#x2F;How-to-Brew-Coffee</a>

            Coffee drinkers like their coffee hot.  They tell me the taste is much better when it is brewed hot. I know I was working at McDonalds at the time of the suit, and a few weeks later we adjusted our temperatures to the minimum of the acceptable range from the max, and immediately got complaints.  (the complaints didn&#x27;t start until after the adjustment)

            It’s not OR but AND: as described in that article, the law firms didn’t come up with the lawsuit out of the blue but saw the hundreds of people who set up “victims” groups alleging all sorts of injuries caused by the vaccine.<p>It seems noteworthy that this was relatively early in the Internet reshaping society: these groups had websites but not massive companies like Facebook promoting them. This ability for people to self-organize and diagnose at a large scale is still having interesting ripple effects, both helping people with unusual conditions which are commonly misdiagnosed and helping build lawsuits or political movements from people who really aren’t interested in accepting the science.

            Honestly, I live in the the WORST NY county for Lyme but it really isn&#x27;t that big a deal. The country across in Vermont is Vermont&#x27;s top Lyme county.  And I live in the woods.<p>Basically it&#x27;s easily treated once you are fairly sure you have it with VERY MILD antibiotics that aren&#x27;t super at risk for resistance.  Getting Lyme is a pretty normal and common thing.  Akin to catching a cold - it&#x27;s simply inevitable but you will be treatable.<p>You also need to check for ticks and putting on DEET is always an option.  Thinking about what you wear is also SOP but no big deal (per spicybright&#x27;s comment).<p>But honestly WE don&#x27;t worry about it that much despite being completely endemic.

            I believe you intended this to be reassuring but consider how it reads to the many people who’ve had significant, long-term effects from the disease. Maybe tone it down a bit on the “no big deal” front and focus on the key part: “if promptly diagnosed” with the advice about prevention and detection that implies.

            I think it&#x27;s just a difference in perspective from someone living where it&#x27;s endemic and pretty much impossible to outright prevent. You get used to it. You hear similar perspectives on malaria from people living in countriew where that is rife. And indeed on other dangers. For example, australians don&#x27;t tend to see poisonous snakes or spiders as a big deal.

            Oh, definitely — my point was simply that it&#x27;s good to think about how that would sound to someone who _isn&#x27;t_ used to that risk. Saying “no big deal” runs the risk of sounding like ”I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about” or even “I&#x27;m downplaying this for some reason”. I don&#x27;t think the person I replied to was in either category but I do think with medical concerns it&#x27;s important to acknowledge that someone&#x27;s concerns are reasonable before introducing some things which might make the risk more palatable (e.g. doctors now are far more likely to quickly recognize it and treat it aggressively since there&#x27;s been a lot of awareness that this is becoming endemic in many areas where it didn&#x27;t used to be common).
