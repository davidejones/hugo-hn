            This technology will soon be out of Apple’s control. Higgins correctly highlights the immense pressure Apple will get from governments and other actors to bend the technology and use it for something else than csam. It will happen, people are probably already thinking how to apply such pressure. Sooner or later Apple will cave in and they will have only themselves to blame when freedom supports in Sudan or LGBTQ activists in Saudi Arabia will be jailed. The issue here is not where to draw the line, but who will draw it (spoiler: not Apple).

            Exactly.  Governments tend to accept &quot;we lack the technical capability to comply with your request&quot; (unless said capability is legally mandated, e.g. so-called &quot;lawful intercept&quot;).  They do not tend to accept &quot;we possess the technical capability to comply with your request but choose not to do so&quot;.

            Ten years from now we will read a leaked document stating that US authorities requested FISA Courts warrants (or similar) and made Apple scan for things other than csam. It already happened.
Court orders are easier than hacks once you iron out the legal opinions.

            Even if that&#x27;s true, this method at least drops some part of the process on the client where it can be inspected, vs. <i>all</i> scanning happening in the cloud, entirely behind closed doors.<p>Does that mean nothing bad can happen? No. But it does mean that when something changes, we at least know <i>something changed.</i>

            The database will change every update. It’s not like the NCEMC db already has all possible CSAM. Every time they find more, they add it to the DB. Thus, it will probably change every time Apple pushes an OS update.

            Why does anyone even assume that a bad actor would need to apply pressure?<p>These databases are unauditable by design -- all they&#x27;d need to do is hand Apple their own database of &quot;CSAM fingerprints collected by our own local law enforcement that are more relevant in this region&quot; (filled with political images of course), and ask Apple to apply their standard CSAM reporting rules.<p>That&#x27;s it...

            Apple does not need to be able to audit the database to discover that it is not a CSAM database. Matches are reviewed by Apple before being reported to the authorities, so they would see that they are getting matches on non-CSAM material.<p>They wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be able to tell if it was a false positive matching real CSAM material or a true positive matching illegitimate material in the databases put there by a government trying to misuse it, but they don&#x27;t need to know whether it is or not. They just need to see that it isn&#x27;t CSAM and so does not need to be reported.

            That&#x27;s even worse - so now apple is deciding whether to report something even if it matches the data provided by the government. It&#x27;s not their role to judge the contents, only whether the match is correct or not, otherwise even with actual CSAM content, are they going to be making judgement calls? What if the system matches loli content which I imagine is in that database but legal in places? Are they going to then get the user&#x27;s location(!!!!) To see whether it&#x27;s legal there or not, or....guess? Or what? Because the only way to make this system work is to report every match and then let <i>actual</i> law enforcement figure out if it&#x27;s illegal or not.<p>So yeah, the entire system is fucked and shouldn&#x27;t exist. Apple is not law enforcement and them saying &quot;we&#x27;ll just prescreen every submission&quot; is actually worse, not better.

            &gt; It&#x27;s not their role to judge the contents, only whether the match is correct or not.<p>Which is what they would be doing.<p>Some government gives Apple a purported CSAM hash database, which Apple only accepts because it is a CSAM database. An image gets a match. Apple looks at it and it is not CSAM. Therefore, unless the government lied to them about the database, it must be a false positive and gets rejected as an incorrect match.<p>The rejection is not because Apple judged the content per se. They just determined that it must be a false positive given the government&#x27;s claims about the database.

            My point was, what if you have content in there that is CSAM in some places but isn&#x27;t in others(for instance - drawings). If apple employees report it to authorities in a state where it isn&#x27;t illegal, they just suspended your account and reported you to authorities without any reason. So like I said, then you get into this trap of - do apple employees start judging whether the match &quot;should&quot; count? What if a picture isn&#x27;t actually pornographic but made it into the database(say a child in underwear, maybe it&#x27;s there because of a connection to an abuse case, but it isn&#x27;t a picture of abuse per se). Again, is this random person at apple going to be making judgement calls about validity of matches against a <i>government provided database</i>? Because again, I don&#x27;t believe this can ever work. Maybe those are edge cases, sure, but my point is that as soon as you allow some apple employee to make a judgement, you are introducing new risks.

            My family, my wife&#x27;s family, and much of our extended families are all privacy conscious (we chat over Signal, just like we close our window blinds at night)... and they are all alarmed over this and ready to ditch Apple if they don&#x27;t change their stance on this.<p>All it takes is a wiretap warrant and Apple would have to scan on-device pictures and iMessages for whatever the wiretap says. This is true even if the phone has iCloud switched off (most of us already do), since all Apple has to do is change a Boolean variable&#x27;s value, or something similar requiring no creative effort (and hence legally coercible).

            Apple can’t be selling out if they literally have no way of knowing what is in the database of illicit content.<p>That is why they said that the content has to be in two separate nation’s databases. Of course, there is no information that I’ve seen about what other nation’s db they would use. And without another nation, there will be no content in the database? I doubt it.<p>Regardless, it’s a moot issue, since we already know that the 5 eyes all conspire and would gladly add content for each other, the same as several middle-east nations.

            It very well may change it.<p>Right now they have no ability to scan every photo on every iOS device for “objectionable” content (as defined by them on that day, based on their mood).

So you can&#x27;t update the DB without everyone knowing it was changed.<p>Yes... Because it is impossible for different servers to be configured as backends depending on where handsets are destined to be sold. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s possible to quickly whip up a geolocation aware API that can swap things out on the fly. C&#x27;mon. This isn&#x27;t even hard. These are all trivially surmountable problems. The one thing standing in the way of already having done this, was there was no way in hell anyone would have been daft enough to even try doing something like this with a straight face. For heaven sake, even Hollywood lampshaded it with that &quot;using cell phones as broadband sensors&quot; shtick in the Dark Knight or whatever it was.<p>&gt;This is a political fight, and if we all act like ideologues we&#x27;re going to lose it all in the end.<p>The fight was lost the moment someone caved to &quot;think of the children&quot;. Every last warning sign that has been left all over the intellectual landscape ignored, history, risk, human nature, any semblance of good sense ignored.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m sitting here scratching my head wondering if I took a wrong turn or something 20 years ago.

            I realise that you&#x27;re talking about global Governments, but when it comes to the United States, Government pressure cannot compel Apple to expand the on-device searching because that would be an unequivocal violation of the 4th Amendment of the US Constitution. <i>Because it is a search of your private property compelled by the Government.</i><p>(After a photo is uploaded to a cloud service, a search of photos stored on servers doesn&#x27;t enjoy the same 4A protection as this falls under the so-called &quot;third party doctrine&quot;.)<p>(Apple searching for CSAM is also not a 4A violation because it was Apple&#x27;s free choice as a private company to do so, and you will have agreed to it as part of the Terms of Service of the next version of iOS.)

            The USPS is restricted by the Constitution and other legislation on what it can do.<p>From: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspis.gov&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;USPIS-FAQs.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspis.gov&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;USPIS-FAQs....</a><p>&gt; 4. Can Postal Inspectors open mail if they feel it may contain something illegal?
First-Class letters and parcels are protected against search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and, as such, cannot be opened without a search warrant. If there is probable cause to believe the contents of a First-Class letter or parcel violate federal law, Postal Inspectors can obtain a search warrant to open the mail piece.

            It seems like big techs are taking the place of court in some domains. They draw the lines and execute the rules. Even more, it is almost impossible to know where are the real lower and upper bound of rules. There are already some examples (e.g. app is banned for unknown&#x2F;vague reasons).

            &gt; Higgins correctly highlights the immense pressure Apple will get from governments and other actors to bend the technology and use it for something else than csam. It will happen, people are probably already thinking how to apply such pressure. Sooner or later Apple will cave in and they will have only themselves to blame when freedom supports in Sudan or LGBTQ activists in Saudi Arabia will be jailed.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble seeing how Apple&#x27;s actions make this any more or less likely. It&#x27;s not like matching photos is some esoteric concept that no repressive government has ever thought of before. It&#x27;s not even like it&#x27;s particularly hard. Apple&#x27;s implementation is the most privacy sensitive way of doing it, but if the rules were going to come down they were going to come down, and they&#x27;d be implemented in less privacy sensitive ways.

            Apple can also choose to exit that country. There aren&#x27;t many countries which Apple would even consider risking its global reputation in order to retain that market. US, China, Europe, maybe the UK. That&#x27;s about it.<p>If Saudi Arabia or Sudan tried to turn the screws, the business case for Apple is absolutely clear-cut: they <i>leave.</i> This isn&#x27;t even up for debate. There&#x27;s far too much at risk globally than there is to gain domestically from compliance.<p>Not only do they avoid serious damage to their global reputation (something they&#x27;ll be extremely sensitive to, as the last two weeks have taught them) it would represent a massive opportunity for Apple to earn weeks of free media coverage that aligns with their security narrative.

            I&#x27;d love to be a privacy purist on this, but the fact is that there is not going to be any going back on CSAM content scanning of images in iCloud.<p>So either we take this approach, or end up with a worse one, like pure on-cloud scanning with no transparency whatsoever.<p>I read the technical paper today, and this solution is super clever, well considered, and checks just about every box a crypto-solution-phile would want. I don&#x27;t know how it gets better than this.

            I reject the premise that CSAM scanning is a solution to anything, especially if the goal is to E2EE encrypt the rest of the photos.<p>My understanding from following this debacle is that law-enforcement don&#x27;t have resources to investigate everyone who just have CSAM they focus on people who match and have other photos of novel abuse they can track down, and here they will only get an account name and a list of 30 CSAM photos the user had.<p>All this system will do is drive up Apples numbers on a &quot;total child abuse found&quot; scoreboard and do very little to help any actual children in need.

            Accepting this stuff allowing yourself to blown by these evil winds, don&#x27;t do that.<p>Part of the reason for these voluntary scans is because the state would have a difficult time implementing universal spyware on its own and it needs Apple for this. This stuff is by no means certain and how &quot;we&quot; helps determine whether it happens. Also, the state has secretly spied and attempted to legitimatize universal spying but we&#x27;ve had push back on many occasions. We should keep that up.

            By raising five-eyes, you are suggesting that another country could launder the request on behalf of the USA in order to circumvent the 4th Amendment.

            This is true, but there aren&#x27;t many countries which Apple would even consider risking its global reputation in order to retain that market.

So we&#x27;re talking about Apple complying to demands being made in public.<p>In the case of the EU, it would have to be passed into law in a way that makes equal demands upon all of Apple&#x27;s competitors. And in that case, everyone must comply with the law irrespective of whether any existing CSAM detection apparatus was in place. (Thus it&#x27;s a sheer cliff, not a slippery slope.)<p>If Saudi Arabia or Sudan tried to turn the screws, the business case for Apple is absolutely clear-cut: they would leave. It wouldn&#x27;t even be up for debate. There would be far too much at risk globally than they&#x27;d ever hope to gain&#x2F;retain in that domestic market from compliance. Not only would they never risk serious damage to their global reputation (something they&#x27;ll be extremely sensitive to, as the last two weeks have taught them) it would represent a massive opportunity for Apple to earn weeks of free media coverage that aligns with their security narrative.

            I agree with the article that not only are implementation problems a potential threat, but it also sets a dangerous precedent. I also understand that Apple is attempting to compromise with governments that are still pressuring it to create an encryption back door or hand over keys (which it did in China by having another company operate iCloud there). Governments have often used the pursuit and prosecution of child abusers and terrorists as a scapegoat for eroding privacy for all its citizens. Privacy and liberty versus the lawful pursuit of criminals are challenging problems to balance, especially when governments and law enforcement want a free pass searching for whatever content they deem illegal. Governments decide what photos, communications, and even thoughts (if they could) are legal and which one are illegal. Who knows what some (new) governments may decree new obscenity laws? They could legislate that some pictures once considered lawful and innocent are now unlawful and obscene, retroactively, and ask or attempt to force Apple to search for those newly criminal images.<p>Apple’s new image scanning technology is almost as much of a backdoor to individuals&#x27; privacy as handing out their device decryption keys on demand. Except with this new tech, finding criminal activity is even easier for law enforcement, as Apple will attempt to locate criminals for them.<p>That said, there are better privacy tools available for those that need as much privacy as possible, but they are nowhere near as user-friendly as Apple&#x27;s devices. For instance, if this new search tool only searches images uploaded to iCloud, as claimed, what stops a pedophile or a journalist from disabling iCloud photo storage and synchronizing photos manually? It is extra work, but not difficult. Keeping average everyday things and activities,  such as web browsing history, mostly private requires more effort and expertise than manually copying photos between a phone and a computer.

            The CSAM scanning solution allows law enforcement to do one thing, assuming they have full control over the image hash database: find people who have multiple photos that are already known to law enforcement that they upload to iCloud.<p>How would you use this to find criminals in general? I have a hard time to think of a very useful example. Maybe photos of bomb plans downloaded somewhere from the internet that are known to be used by criminal groups?<p>As to what stops a pedophile or a journalist form disabling iCloud photo storage: Absolutely nothing. This solution is supposed catch people storing CSAM photos in iCloud, that&#x27;s it. A careful pedophile will not be caught by this.

            I am trying to say it&#x27;s not possible to tell with certainty from a lowres picture that you are looking at false positive. For example low contrast CSAM imposed on a document could trigger NeuralHash match but the lowres image will look like a false positive.

            For your example, wouldn&#x27;t that only work to make the original source image that&#x27;s polluting the CSAM database look like CSAM in lowres?

            I agree, it would be useful if Apple could be clearer by what they mean by a derivative. I recall reading somewhere that it&#x27;s a reduced resolution, grayscale copy of the image. I can&#x27;t vouch for that, but that would be a plausible notion of what the &quot;derivative&quot; would be.<p>Personally I would also be placing a hard watermark in the middle of the image, or maybe some hard slashes randomly through the image, so that &quot;clean&quot; images cannot leak out of human review.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine that the derivative is a 0.5 megapixel, grayscale, watermarked, HEIC-compressed copy of the original image. This would be plenty to determine with zero ambiguity that the image is actually &quot;A1&quot; classified, i.e. depicts a prepubescent minor (&quot;A&quot;) engaged in a sex act (&quot;1&quot;).

            More precisely, 30 carefully crafted false positives. All of which need to be imported into your iPhone&#x27;s photo library to sit alongside pictures of your dog and your mum.

            There’s been such a debate over this now that I don’t know why Apple are still trying? It’s not even their job to catch child porn. There are many far-reaching cooperations like at Interpol and Europol that successfully bust child porn groups? Even anonymizing networks like Tor are not safe havens. These guys don’t have it easy even today.<p>So why is Apple suddenly extremely adamant about this? Would it even cost them anything to not go here?<p>They’re a hardware and services company making mobile and computing devices mostly geared towards entertainment and creative work.

            I doubt it, considering they give up customers&#x27; data when the government requests it for 150,000 users&#x2F;accounts a year[1]. Not only do they choose to give data when requested, they have to comply with court orders, as well.<p>Also, governments care about much more than just CSAM. They care about terrorism, drug manufacturing, drug and human trafficking, organized crime, gangs, fraud etc.<p>This speculation only makes sense if Apple intends to use their CSAM detection and reporting system to detect and report on those other things, as well.<p>Governments won&#x27;t like that either, because during investigations and discovery, they&#x27;ll want all of the customer&#x27;s data that could be evidence of crimes. These detection and reporting systems, as implemented and by themselves, are only useful for flagging suspicious people.

            This article is full of inaccuracies.<p>a) People have extracted a pre-release version from an older iOS phone. It is not the one that will be released and not the same one Apple uses server-side to verify the process.<p>b) Adversaries can not reasonably break this process by flooding it with bad data across a range of compromised phones. The client side version is there to prevent this as is the fact it would require jailbroken devices with iCloud logins.<p>c) If you can&#x27;t trust Apple not to include non-CSAM hashes in the database then how can you trust them not to compromise the operating system itself ? It&#x27;s illogical. Apple verifies hashes against two sources and two manual checks are required thus needing multiple failure points in the process.

            Isn&#x27;t that no greater risk than the status quo, though?<p>Apple already has all these photos uploaded to their servers and knows the keys as iCloud Photos isn&#x27;t end-to-end encrypted, so if a government can coerce them into cooperating with running scans like that, this new system doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.<p>(If the argument is that they can be coerced into changing the new system to scan non-uploaded photos and reporting them outside of the iCloud Photos upload process... that&#x27;s a threat that applies just as much to every phone.

There probably isn&#x27;t even a group of ten individuals at Apple that could do it without other employees finding out. And as smart as you think the US Government is, there&#x27;s no way they could possibly know who those ten people were.<p>So the letter goes to Apple. They have ample time and resources to push back indefinitely. Demanding that Apple implement a Government dragnet across tens of millions of private devices is so far beyond unconstitutional that complying wouldn&#x27;t even be fleetingly contemplated as an option. In fact, Apple is the sort of company that would move heaven and earth to ensure that this unconstitutional NSL becomes public. If nothing else, their defiance of it would be fantastic PR.<p>Therefore it would be a massively stupid-ass move for the Government to try. They would have zero prospect of a positive outcome and they know it.

            Okay, but now you&#x27;re positing a scenario which is entirely pointless. Seriously, what would be the point? If you know you need to conceal the images to put them into your photo library, you <i>surely</i> know it&#x27;s a stupid idea to put them there in the first place. It&#x27;s all but impossible to find a supply of CSAM material without being made acutely aware of their illegal status.<p>Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t get: who are these people importing CSAM into their camera roll? I for one have never felt the urge to import regular, legal porn into my camera roll. So why would anyone do that with stuff they know could land them in prison? Who the hell co-mingles their deepest darkest dirtiest secret amongst pictures of their family and last night’s dinner?<p>If someone wants to conceal their CSAM library, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s probably dozens of apps in the App Store that can store photos securely behind an additional layer of encryption.

            I&#x27;m not arguing that these aren&#x27;t real problems, but neither are unique problems of the the client side scanning solution.

            Yeah I agree that B is likely a non issue, at least not an issue that affects the users directly. But C doesn&#x27;t make me feel any better because the fundamental issue is where the scanning happens. If it happens off my device it cannot happen to photos I don&#x27;t send off my device. I understand they have policy governing this, but that&#x27;s not addressing the core conceptual problem of crossing the network boundary onto what I pretend is &quot;my&quot; device.

            Putting some extra hashes into a database - especially one tucked away in a corner of the product - is a lot easier than compromising kernel code or a driver. And in this case the database is not exclusively the work of Apple, so third parties have the ability to insert hashes.

            I didn&#x27;t downvote it, but I can understand why some people might have. Because while it&#x27;s superficially true, it&#x27;s disingenuous in practice. All security is, at its core, a network of trust between you and other entities. Open source isn&#x27;t secure because it&#x27;s open, it&#x27;s secure because <i>you trust Canonical, you trust Linus Torvalds, you trust GNU, etc.</i> And those people trust other people—hence the &quot;network&quot; of trust.<p>Saying that you can inspect the source code is true in theory. But unless you&#x27;ve done the full audit yourself, you&#x27;re personally as blind as you are with closed source code. You&#x27;re choosing to trust whichever security researchers deeply understand the security implications of all the gobbledegook in all the USB drivers, and you&#x27;re trusting that Canonical is shipping you the same version that security researchers have validated. For 99.9% of users, it all comes down to blind trust.<p>As Linus himself once said: <i>&quot;If you have ever done any security work and it didn&#x27;t involve the concept of a network of trust, it was not a security work. It was masturbation.&quot;</i>

            And I already do, but as a default standard I would just much rather see a phone large enough to never need iCloud but of course I didn&#x27;t address the other issues that will now come from a proprietary phone.

I never leave GPS turned on, I don&#x27;t give any apps access to such features, and I buy phones outright in cash and put them on prepaid from the start. This is not good enough. If the next set of surveillance features are scanning messages, photos, videos on personal devices then it&#x27;s nothing but a rented device and the only option are custom fully open source devices.

            iPhones already come in 256GB and 512GB versions, though you have to go up to the iPhone Pro line to get 512GB.
