            Wow, that&#x27;s interesting. I didn&#x27;t know that&#x27;s how CCDs worked. If I understand correctly, 1&#x2F;3 of the &quot;pixels&quot; captured the red, 1&#x2F;3 green, 1&#x2F;3 blue. Does that mean the sensor now has 3x the resolution it had before?

            Often it is even 50% green, 25% red and 25% blue pixels. There are different patterns, though. What you get as &quot;megapixel&quot; number of cameras counts subpixels individually, that is a &quot;10MP&quot; labelled camera does not have 10 million pixels of each color but 10 million subpixels in total.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bayer_filter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bayer_filter</a><p>If you have a device that can output RAWs, you can look at a RAW image using the FOSS photo development program &quot;Darktable&quot;.

            Demosaicing algorithms are <i>very good</i> at restoring the resolution &quot;lost&quot; to the BFA. They can introduce some artifacts (zipper effect, &quot;labyrinth&quot;, fringe color, to name a few) but in general, sharpness isn&#x27;t lost as much as people imagine.<p>Nowadays they classical algorithms are being replaced by convnets that are trained on different BFA&#x2F;image pairs and can get very good results -- at the cost of placing a convnet in the middle (so much higher computational cost, which can be offloaded to a GPU&#x2F;AI accelerator if available).<p>If you want to see what a &quot;pixel perfect&quot; camera gives you, there are the Sigma cameras with Foveon sensors[0] or you can check the cameras that have a sensor-shift superresolution approach (some pro Olympus and Hasselblad models have this feature). Sensor-shift SR has the problem that it works best on static scenes, because it takes several images which are then later combined on a single picture, and if there&#x27;s movement between the images it may introduce a few artifacts.<p>[0] which do full color data for every pixel, as they use silicon depth to filter wavelenth

            Foveon sounds great in theory, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver IMHO. It can achieve parity in terms of pixel level sharpness and color at the lower ISOs, but picture quality breaks down very quickly even at moderate ISOs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;yyrndzkk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;yyrndzkk</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;t9nnadc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;t9nnadc</a>

            I always wondered if this was a good ratio. I get that green usually has the strongest signal and thus better low-light performance. For bright shots, I find that preserving higher resolution in blue results in higher perceptual resolution of the final image. You can simulate something like it by using an extreme &#x27;night mode&#x27; more-red&#x2F;no-blue display mode and watching a 4k video.

            Green was chosen because it&#x27;s to what the human eye is most sensitive. Look at Fuji&#x27;s X-trans[0], and there are also RGBW arrays that prioritize dynamic range.<p>All in all, the BFA is &quot;good enough&quot; most of the times. For the use cases where it isn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re either:<p>* Budget constrained and can&#x27;t really afford not using BFA<p>* Able to (pay for and) use either a color wheel in front of your sensor, or go with prism + triple sensor.<p>* Bite the bullet and go with a &quot;strange&quot; color array. You&#x27;ll probably need to work on the software side for demosaicing to get proper support and fix eventual artifacts.<p>[0] even more green! 20&#x2F;36 photosites are green, 8 red 8 blue<p>[1] with W being white, meaning no color filter or &quot;panchromatic cell&quot;. In theory this helps on dim light conditions.

            &gt; I always wondered if this was a good ratio. I get that green usually has the strongest signal and thus better low-light performance.<p>More importantly, green is close to what your eyes perceive as luminance. This is important because you can perceive a lot more luma detail than chroma detail. This is why things like 4:2:2 sampling work.<p>If you read Bayer&#x27;s original patent, he proposed using Y Cr Cb (luminance, colour part red, colour part blue) instead of GBR filters[0]. This would people optimal from a computer science perspective. Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work physically. Sensing negative-blue and negative-red can&#x27;t really be done with a simple filter.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US3971065" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US3971065</a>

            Since the &quot;pixels&quot; are either formed at every intersection of 4 photosites (overlapping each other) or by interpolating data for each color to include the &quot;missing&quot; photosites (which is effectively the same), the megapixel count should fairly accurately represent both the number of photosites and the number of pixels in the output image.<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure how the edge pixels are treated, but the difference in number between pixels and photosites should be on the order of a few thousand at most.

            Are you saying that one photosite might be included in more than one pixel and therefore the overall pixel count is roughly equal to the number of photosites?

            I&#x27;m saying that each photosite definitely <i>is</i> included in more than one output pixel, and I&#x27;m also saying that the number of output pixels should be about the same as the number of photosites.<p>This is obviously capturing less information than if you had a completely separate set of photosites for each pixel, but the megapixel count of cameras is nevertheless accurate.<p>Modern cameras sometimes come with a &quot;pixel shift&quot; function, which uses the image stabilization system to take 4 images each shifted one photosite from the others to construct an image where each pixel contains the information of 4 independent photosites with no sharing between the pixels.<p>The resolution of the final image is the same as a normal image, but the result is much clearer, and far less likely to suffer from blue&#x2F;red moire.

            Bayer filters are 50% green, 25% red, 25% blue for consumer devices.<p>The reason is that green actually captures much more of the luminance information, and our eyes have a much better luminance resolution than color resolution.<p>Tangentially, it&#x27;s why the so-called YUV 420 (chroma subsampling) is so effective, where it&#x27;s effectively encoding Y (luminance) data for every pixel (in a block of 4), but U&#x2F;V (chrominance) only for every pair (or quad, someone correct me) of pixels.<p>There are examples online of pictures [1] with their luminance resolution decreased: you can immediately see the pixelation, and of their chrominance resolution decreased: you can barely tell the difference.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chroma_subsampling#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Colorcomp.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chroma_subsampling#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File...</a>

            Because their patents ran out before all the complementary technologies were economically feasible (and CMOS sensors were invented by someone else by that point anyway).  It&#x27;s actually a terrible example of the disruption dilemma.<p>Edit: And there was really no feasible transition path for them anyway.  The business depended on skimming a little bit for every photo taken.  The main selling point of digital cameras was that you could take unlimited photos at no extra cost.<p>Customers aren&#x27;t stupid.  Even with patents, if you make the camera more expensive to account for the lost revenue on film and processing chemicals, people aren&#x27;t going to buy it.

            YUV&#x2F;YCbCr 420 means that there is one set of chroma samples (Cb+Cr) for each 2x2 block of luma samples (pixels).<p>Often, the chroma samples fall on pixels in even rows and on even lines. So pixels in odd rows or on odd lines, have to borrow (interpolate) their chroma values from neighbouring pixels.

            True, astrophotographers like monochrome camera because you can prioritize gathering brightness signal over color signal, so you get more detailed photo; you can also use narrowband filter and image under full moon or in inner cities.<p>However, astrophotographers also complain about the price premium of monochrome camera. Given the same sensor, the monochrome version is typically 20% - 30% more expensive than the color version, which is counterintuitive - you don&#x27;t need to put the Bayer filter on! So if we can perfect the technique to debayer color sensor, the astrophotographer community would be elated.
