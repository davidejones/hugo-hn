            &gt; This is like complaining that you drove down the road, and there was a freeway on-ramp next to an off-ramp, and the off-ramp has a sign that says &quot;do not enter&quot;, and you&#x27;re mad that the on-ramp and the off-ramp are next to each other,  because you might try to get on the off-ramp.<p>&gt; I have to say, this is the most ridiculous complaint I&#x27;ve seen this month.  Users complained for several years that Google Voice didn&#x27;t have the ability to delete multiple text messages.  Now it does.  If you can&#x27;t cope with figuring out the difference between a trash can icon and a file folder icon, then don&#x27;t use Google Voice.<p>The insidiousness of assuming user bases as monolithic entities has been getting worse.<p>Instead of just assuming that a mythical monolith exists as a representation of users, maybe it&#x27;s possible that many different types of users exist and that at least being able to add configurability would solve 90% of the issues that occur when groups of people with different opinions use the same app?<p>The recommended answer is not a productive discussion maker. You shouldn&#x27;t hand-wave valid UI&#x2F;UX design concerns due to wishes that another part of the user base clamored for. And besides, what if I tap the button by accident? Why was it a good idea to put the &quot;Delete All&quot; button next to the &quot;Archive All&quot; button? And before I forget, I&#x27;ve actually mistaken two different exit ramps before, so the first paragraph is uncalled for.

            100% agreed.  I am a person with very shaky hands when doing something.  It may be &#x27;essential tremors&#x27;, but I&#x27;ve never bothered to get a diagnosis.  It&#x27;s come and gone since I was a kid.<p>I loathe typing on a phone, or worse, clicking some tiny thing on the phone.  The act of tensing my thumb and moving it makes it go haywire at times.<p>I&#x27;m not looking for sympathy, at all.  But realize at least -some- of us users will misclick things often, especially on mobile.

            That goes right up there with the advice of putting a jade egg in your vagina... CBD the cure all! ...except for several things:<p>1) CBD may not be legal&#x2F;available where they are,<p>2) They may be in a job that tests regularly,<p>3) You&#x27;re offering medical advice to someone when you don&#x27;t even know what the diagnosis could be,<p>4) This person could easily be one of those who has adverse reactions to cannabinoids.<p>So yeah, shoving a jade egg up their cooch may actually have been the safer advice here.

            I don’t really see configurability being a reasonable solution to this problem for any group of people. Letting people configure the order in which the delete and archive buttons appear, or whether each button shows a confirm dialog first, isn’t going to address anyone’s problem of having accidentally deleted things permanently.

            I mean the quoted words are from a &quot;Diamond Product Expert&quot;, not an &quot;UI Design Expert&quot;, so I wouldn&#x27;t take that rant seriously. Hehe.<p>I guess it&#x27;s just some team in Google couldn&#x27;t decide whether or not &quot;Do you want to delete N messages?&quot; is statistically a good enough prompt message.

            I&#x27;ve used Google voice for some time but I feel that they have abandoned the product for a while and will be giving it the axe like they did with Hangouts and their other chats. It really sucked when Hangouts shut down and now I couldn&#x27;t get the chats within the new Google Chat app. I miss the old Xmpp Gchat honestly!<p>Speaking of XMPP I&#x27;m in the process of switching over to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmp.chat&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmp.chat&#x2F;</a> for a VOIP text solution which has worked great so far. If you own the Xmpp server you have even more control.

            I&#x27;ve used Google Voice from before it was even Google Voice, it was called Grand Central or something and they gave me free business cards with my number on it.<p>GV has always been a red headed step child product. It doesn&#x27;t work natively with any android smart watch, its integrations into other products is sketchy and flaky (like there used to be a google voice widget for gmail). Features have been slowly deteriorating for years. The only reason I still use it as my main number is that it&#x27;s easy to text in my browser. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s easy to do with carrier websites but I&#x27;ve certainly never seen them advertise it.<p>It&#x27;s 2021 and I still can&#x27;t get video texts on GV. Well, I can, but they&#x27;re literally less than 240p resolution. To the point it&#x27;s difficult to even tell what&#x27;s happening. And before potato quality, it was flat out not an option for like a decade when every single phone supported it.<p>Group texting also seems to not really work, and the &quot;reactions&quot; people on iphones use aren&#x27;t supported.

            xmpp gchat still works. It was supposed to be deprecated long ago, but it still works (maybe with limitations). I use it on my phone with conversations.im. You&#x27;ll need an app password to log in.

            If he reads HackerNews and is looking at our responses, I hope he sees mine.<p>He needs a vacation. Right now. Like, no computer, somewhere elsewhere.<p>That’s the kind of response I’ve seen at work when covid is getting everyone angry and hateful.<p>There’s nothing helpful in it, it’s attacking, and frankly, he needs to go read it later and think about what he’s said from another person’s perspective, especially a person with any sort of disability. He claims “30 years IT experience” and yet seems to have never worked with a 70 year old and a computer. Even their mouse movement is shaken.

            &gt;He claims “30 years IT experience”<p>I&#x27;ve written here before about what killed Usenet (&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27636397" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27636397</a>&gt;). Quoting myself:<p>&gt;That said, there are server- and client-side anti-spam tools of varying effectiveness. A related but bigger problem for Usenet is people of the type this post discusses, those with actual mental illness; think &quot;50 year olds with undiagnosed autism&quot;. Usenet is such a niche network nowadays that there has to be meaningful motivation to participate, and if the motivation is not a sincere interest in the subject it&#x27;s, in my experience, going to be people with very troubled personal lives which their online behavior reflects. Again, as overall traffic declined, their relative contribution and visibility grew. This, not spam, is what has mostly killed Usenet.<p>Serving as volunteer &quot;help&quot; for a Google product on a Google Groups forum also counts as a niche network, with similar unfortunate results when not enough sane people participate to outweigh the weirdos.

            It&#x27;s sad that Google has chosen the support strategy of having these derelict forums staffed only by volunteers. Even sadder that this is probably the closest thing OP will get to a professional response from Google.

            What I don&#x27;t understand is that if you believe your users are idiots doesn&#x27;t that mean you need to design a product that an idiot can use?<p>Berating users is just ridiculous and does nothing but harm the product. I am seriously pissed off at this culture of &quot;we know best.&quot; It is a disconnect from the userbase and we&#x27;ve constantly seen it lead to the product being overtaken by a company that doesn&#x27;t follow this principle.

            I&#x27;m not sure how that makes things better. In fact, I think it makes things worse. You&#x27;re letting random people that are self described experts? That&#x27;s a great way to create a toxic environment. Every single place I&#x27;ve gone to that has a &quot;community support&quot; that actual employees rarely or never visit has been extremely toxic and unhelpful. They create feedback loops for this toxicity and &quot;in crowd.&quot;

            Actually providing support to users would require hiring a lot of people and maybe actually empowering them to take actions that were helpful; but, probably empowering them opens security concerns, so they&#x27;d just tell you to use the self-service things that are probably broken anyway. So that option is not a good use of Google&#x27;s resources.<p>Moderating a community self-help site well requires a lot of people too, so just leaving it to the community seems like the only option for Google.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of companies try these sites, and they start with real employees putting real responses, but it quickly spirals into unanswered questions and terribleness. The only ones that work are where there are lots of company paid moderators keeping things focused and productive, but I&#x27;m sure management thought community support was going to reduce support costs.

            At least in both situations there Sheets allows you to undo the delete, so the closeness to other commands isn&#x27;t so lethal. I&#x27;ve got no UX or UI training, but I gotta imagine that it&#x27;d be a basic rule that delete actions must always include a confirmation request or an undo option. In Voice, the lack of both confirmation and undo is just ludicrous.

            I’ve been using Telnyx for a while for burner numbers for a couple of ‘burner’ numbers.<p>Outside of the phone number itself (or the cost to port), it’s pretty much pay for what you use. Does require some setup once you have a number, but as long as you’ve got a SIP capable device (or desktop&#x2F;mobile app like Bria) you can use the number on it.

            It really blows my mind that these Google forums are entirely staffed by unpaid people who are deemed &quot;experts&quot; (with no inside knowledge of how the service in question is developed or what the plans for it are). Why do people volunteer to help a TRILLION dollar corporation with their customer support?

            It&#x27;s possible that some people think Google will hire them this way.  They probably hear about the great salaries and benefits that programmers get, and think they can get it too if they just try hard enough.

            This isn&#x27;t a desire to be helpful. A desire to feel important maybe? Is Bluescat lashing out because they can&#x27;t find a good answer to the question and process no real power to fix it? Who knows, but the desire there isn&#x27;t to be helpful.
