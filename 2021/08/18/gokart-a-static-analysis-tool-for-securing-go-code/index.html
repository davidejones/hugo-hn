            Go has some nice tooling which is quite easy to use w.r.t. static analysis. I started writing a nil pointer analysis tool which was going to take advantage of and provide some more advanced information*. I &quot;unfortunately&quot; had a lot more fun stuff to do during my vacation, but it was very easy to get started with! So kudos to the Go team for making this kind of stuff possible for a 1-man team.<p>* Just a forward-style abstract interpretation living on-top of Go&#x27;s type system as an additional layer so you get explanations for why the tool believes that a nil-pointer dereference may occur, etc.

            Then it boggles your mind that Go functions the way most popular languages work. You don&#x27;t see so much dunking on Python, Java, Clojure, Ruby, &amp;c, over this, even though these languages dominate the leaderboards.<p>Which is fine, except that this is probably the second-most boring critique of Go, one virtually everyone has heard before, and it has little if anything to do with the story we&#x27;re actually commenting on, despite having spawned a huge thread about option types.<p>If GoKart had been my project, I&#x27;d be annoyed.

            - MyPy doesn&#x27;t have pervasive nullability, but distinguishes nullable and non-nullable types in the type system. A function declared to return int but randomly returns None has a bug in its type hints.<p>- I dunk on Java for pervasive nullability too (though there are tools that add @Nullable xor @NonNull annotations used for analysis, possibly sound). But Go has over a decade more hindsight and should&#x27;ve known better.<p>I haven&#x27;t used the other languages.

            &gt; <i>[Python] distinguishes nullable and non-nullable types in the type system. A function declared to return int but randomly returns None has a bug in its type hints.</i><p>Go distinguishes between the two too. You cannot pass nil as a value to int. In fact in Go you&#x27;d get a compiler warning[0] so you don&#x27;t even need to rely on type hints and a properly set up CI&#x2F;CD pipeline to catch said faults:<p>The problem with Go is that pointers can be nullable[1] as well as interfaces[2] (interfaces, crudely speaking, being Go&#x27;s solution to generics and inheritance. Crudely speaking. So interfaces get used <i>a lot</i>).<p>There is some logic to them being nullable if you think about the code from a hardware perspective but given how opinionated the compiler and language is, I feel they could have done more to catch accidental nils to save the developer from having to consciously consider them each time.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;BADNnw08hoo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;BADNnw08hoo</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;b39tY1SDQtZ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;b39tY1SDQtZ</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;Fsjsa_-o7Qb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;Fsjsa_-o7Qb</a>

            The int example was a bit misguided, seeing as int is a primitive type in Go, different from pointer types. In Python, both are references.<p>Basically, it&#x27;s the difference between returning None from a function `def f() -&gt; MyClass` in Python (which is type error) versus returning nil from `func f() &amp;MyClass`, which is completely normal in Go.<p>Having `Optional` in the function signature makes it explicit that one has to check for Nones. Go lacks that.

            Optional parameters are a different thing. Yeah one workaround with the lack of optional parameters are to send nil values, but that&#x27;s only going to work if the type you want optional is a nil&#x27;able type. Plus there&#x27;s nothing stopping null values from being passed in Python code outside of optional parameters. My point is optional parameters are one reason why null values might creep in but not <i>the</i> cause nor reason for null values.<p>Plus I personally think if you need an optional parameter then 99% of the time the API is likely designed wrong from the outset (eg maybe you should instead be passing a class). The reason being is that optional parameters aren&#x27;t always predictable (eg why is this value optional? When do I need to include a value for it?)

            I&#x27;d say it has been a better designed language for sure, which wasn&#x27;t that hard since they just needed to take a look where Java messed up. So many things are obvious in hindsight  so it&#x27;s not a fair comparison. Regarding platform and reach, Java still wins i guess.<p>Disclaimer: Using neither.

            C++ yes. That is why despite its flaws and complexity, it will be around for decades to come.<p>Even on the places where Java and .NET languages took over C++ hegemony, it is still there on the implementation of native&#x2F;extern methods and COM&#x2F;UWP libraries.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget if your favourite compiler is a LLVM&#x2F;GCC frontend, many of its improvements require a bit of C++ code changes as well.

            Programming in Go since 10 years and I do not have to worry about nil pointers. You seem to assume that the possibility of a pointer being nil is something that is complicated, a burden to the programmer and a source of runtime bugs. It&#x27;s not. At least not in Go.

            I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve had a good experience, but yes it is a source of runtime bugs.<p>One piece of code from a well established tech company would just crashloop if authentication failed.

            Right, but my point is, the code which would raise an error because the pointer is nil now raises an error because the Optional is not set.<p>Is there really that much of a difference between those cases?<p>I agree though that in an interface, Optional conveys a more explicit meaning than something pointer-like, which is always a good thing.

            In practice it does make a big difference because if the type system knows about it then it can enforce handling of the exception. (Or more generally, it can just force you to pattern match on the optional time and make sure you handle the empty case.)<p>Go programs crash at runtime. In general, program failures and bugs should surface as soon as possible. Ideally no later than compile time. Instead, Go makes you wait until the app is running.<p>For an app that has a lot of configuration options, for example, there can be a latent bug that crashes the binary for some options. And that bug may not be detected for months because nobody was using that combination of config options.<p>The only real defense of this is to pepper your code with a bunch of nil checks. But these nil checks are also hard to test, so Go devs just learn to ignore missing code coverage. In fact, your code coverage metrics look better if you don&#x27;t check for nil.<p>I&#x27;m sure at some point Go or a library will offer a version of optional types that is well-adopted. But my point is that by the time Go was designed, null references were already widely considered a bad idea and the source of a huge class of computer bugs. Go still deliberately designed them into the type system.

            Basically if you need to manipulate pointers, use safe pointers and keep track of pointer ownership. This is how modern C++ and Rust work.<p>If you don&#x27;t need to manipulate pointers then nil really just represents a degenerate or optional value. For optional values these can be encoded any number of ways depending on the type system. One common pattern is an optional type. Another is to annotate the type to indicate that it might be null.<p>The idea is that if a programmer doesn&#x27;t check that an nullable or optional type is missing then the program should fail at compile time instead of crashing at runtime. Golang chose to crash programs at runtime.<p>So for whatever reason, Go has decided that null pointer dereferences are not a big deal. But God help you if you try to comment out a variable use without assigning it to &quot;_&quot;. Then the program fails to compile.

            I don&#x27;t know about &quot;variety of ways&quot;. You just make it so pointers can&#x27;t be null, then provide a mechanism for <i>opt-in</i> nullability, requiring an explicit check &#x2F; conversion to get a non-nullable pointer (which you can dereference) and allowing free &#x2F; cheap &#x2F; implicit conversion from non-nullable to nullable. This can be:<p>* separate pointer types (e.g. C++ pointers v references)<p>* a built-in sigil &#x2F; wrapper &#x2F; suffix e.g. C#&#x27;s Nullable &#x2F; `?` types<p>* a bog-standard userland sum type e.g. Maybe&#x2F;Option&#x2F;Optional<p>In modern more procedural languages the third option often will have language-level (non-userland) facilities tackled on for better usability but that&#x27;s not a requirement.<p>For cases (2) and (3) it can (depending on language and implementation) also provides a mechanism for making other value types optional without necessarily having to heap-allocate them.

            Usually it&#x27;s forcing the programmer to handle the null case statically, by wrapping the underlying value in something like an optional type and defining the operations that access the underlying value. Think of swift&#x27;s optional unwrapping in &quot;if let&quot; statements

            You don&#x27;t even need generics to avoid nullable pointers, you can special-case it as they special-cased slices, maps, channels, etc… e.g. `*int` -&gt; non-nullable pointer to int; `?int` -&gt; nullable pointer to int, and a tiny bit of flow analysis in nil checks so e.g. `if foo != nil` implicitly creates a new non-nullable version of `foo` inside the block body.

            I&#x27;ve wondered what it would be like to write a thin language that compiles to Go and mainly serves to introduce a reasonable type system on top, while benefitting from its performance and garbage-collection. Could prevent null dereferencing, among other things

            Most criticisms of Go could be adressed by a language with a Hindley-Milner type system: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;survey2020&#x2F;missing_features.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;survey2020&#x2F;missing_features.svg</a> from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;survey2020-results" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;survey2020-results</a>. Having a ML-like that compiles to Go could solve all those issues, while still keeping the great ecosystem that Go managed to build. Just like with Scala, this new language could allow people to see if that&#x27;s what they really want, and offers to the Go team possibilities of evolution without the need to commit completly to them.

            OCaml and Haskell don&#x27;t have Go&#x27;s ecosystem in terms of quantity. For F#, can it be compile to a binary like Go? I searched for a bit and couldn&#x27;t find a good answer. Another thing is that people like to stay in their ecosystems. If you already have a large codebase in Go, internal libraries, etc, switching could be difficult.

            You&#x27;re right about quantity and quality, that&#x27;s why I mentionned quantity precisely. Quantity usually means that most of the stuff has already been made by someone, and people seem to value that a lot. I&#x27;ll add that the documentation of your average OCaml or Haskell library is not the best, while from experience Go is a bit better (usually there are a few basic examples).<p>Thank you for the information on .NET AOT.

            I suspect in part it&#x27;s a combination of 1) Go is good enough as is (and some people don&#x27;t mind Go&#x27;s simple type system or the boilerplate-y but explicit error handling), and 2) the Go tooling is really good -- &quot;go build&quot;, &quot;go test&quot;, etc, would all have to be wrapped or rewritten with slower, buggier versions.

            That&#x27;s the idea!<p>I use Rust for a lot of personal projects mainly because of the type system, not because it doesn&#x27;t have GC. I think GC&#x27;s totally livable for a great many things, and it would help iteration speed a lot to not have to deal with the borrow-checker, but I just can&#x27;t stand working in a language with a shaky type system these days.

            To be clear, I&#x27;m not suggesting that I personally would be able to bootstrap this (and the tooling, and the declarations for existing libraries, etc) and have it take off<p>But if I saw it pop up on HN I&#x27;d jump on board in a heartbeat<p>Go has a lot of compelling benefits around compiling, performance, concurrency, etc that I think would translate. It just made a couple of really unfortunate decisions around null pointers and default values that turn a lot of people off. I think salvaging it from those unfortunate decisions would be worth doing for the right party with the resources to do so, and I think it would appeal to a lot of people<p>I&#x27;m not even sure I would want generics to be added, since that&#x27;s an elephant in this particular room. I just want to be able to have a mote of confidence in the values I&#x27;m working with.
