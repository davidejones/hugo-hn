            You&#x27;re onto something with that particular number there.<p>After a second go at dubiously tinkering with Algolia, I finally found a post I <i>knew</i> I&#x27;d seen a little while back:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24811669" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24811669</a><p>&gt; <i>I have a good friend at Google. The motto they go by is that unless 10000 people are impacted by an issue, it&#x27;s really not worth their time to investigate.</i><p>At Google&#x27;s scale, this makes absolutely perfect sense: Google (according to Wikipedia) currently has 139,995 engineers, and up to approx. 2 to 4.8 billion customers (using a floor of Chrome&#x27;s user base and a ceiling of &quot;number of users connected to the internet&quot;). This means each and every engineer has a broadly averaged&#x2F;amortized potential impact on up to 14,286-34,286 users. None of those developers will consistently produce useful output if they&#x27;re thinking about all that responsibility all day, and probably quite a majority wouldn&#x27;t produce any output at all if they were tasked with interacting with all the users their products impacted (the most impactful developers might be faced with queues filling with maybe 300 tickets a second or more).<p>However, at world scale, where just about everything that relates to humans is sufficiently fractal-like that it doesn&#x27;t track along a 10,000-entry&#x2F;point&#x2F;dimension&#x2F;column&#x2F;etc-sized graph&#x2F;curve&#x2F;vector space&#x2F;BigTable&#x2F;whatever, you get issues like this.<p>I can kinda understand (while headscratching through the math for this for the first time) why Google hires so many external contractors (who presumably aren&#x27;t counted as employees?) to try and combat this sort of thing, but there&#x27;s only so much that can be done there too.<p>It&#x27;s a really difficult problem.<p>Human empathy seems to have a serious bathtub curve for &quot;things and problems that are human-sized&quot;, with maximum sensitivity around maybe 1-20 people. Anything smaller than a human is only intrinsically interesting if it&#x27;s cute, and anything bigger than a human can probably figure its problems out itself, and is only intrinsically worth my attention if whatever it&#x27;s doing might kill *me* in particular, and possibly the group I&#x27;m in.<p>Sadly, this is a problem *because* the humans on both sides of the fence equally bleed red and run the same legacy firmware, while the producer end of the queue is grossly under-represented.<p>Scaling up an individual&#x27;s or group&#x27;s impact unfortunately hits the edge of that empathy bathtub curve in a hurry when you go beyond even just a few hundred recipients, let alone a thousand. What am I supposed to think of 150,000 Twitter likes, or 20 million TikTok views, or 20 upvotes on HN? It sort of blurs out to a fuzzy &quot;...:D&quot; that holds zero semantic value (it doesn&#x27;t provoke an intuitive context-specific response), and also close to zero little intrinsic value (I don&#x27;t know how to reason about it in isolation).<p>So, what are Google&#x27;s engineers supposed to do to solve these kinds of problems? Serious question.<p>Saying &quot;they&#x27;re big enough, they&#x27;ll figure it out&quot; is just bumping into the edge of the empathy curve. Saying &quot;well, they need to scale out <i>their</i> empathy&quot; implies the engineers at Google have access to some sort of intrinsically more sensitive model of intuition (the self-correcting kind that would naturally occur at the individual level and propagates outward in groups). A <i>real</i> solution is needed here.<p>The only thing Google can do is collectively whittle away and figure out solutions to this fundamentally non-intuitive problem using... *drumroll*... bureaucracy. &quot;NOOOoooo,&quot; I hear you say... but that&#x27;s the only glue available to collectively hold *checks* 139,995 empathy bathtub curves together. Yep, it&#x27;s like the PHP of duct tape, but sadly humans haven&#x27;t figured anything else out yet, crazily enough... almost like the empathy model we use doesn&#x27;t find solving for the problem space as a whole interesting, or something...<p>--<p>Ignore the above, Google is a mean bully that abused their power for {killing {Google Reader&#x2F;related-image search&#x2F;other favorite product}&#x2F;locking someone out of their account&#x2F;locking Android down&#x2F;having UI inconsistency&#x2F;etc etc etc} D:&lt;

            It is laughable that &quot;tech giants&quot; are going to great lengths these days in cahoots with elected politicians and warlords (equally), to crack down on &quot;misinformation&quot; and yet when their own algorithm and callous management propagate damaging misinformation, no one can crack the whip on them, so to speak.<p>As others suggested, this needs to hit the court and be brought to the notice of regulators too. What if one day this deceptive &quot;knowledge box&quot; gets someone lynched? Am sure this has already happened if the lens is broad enough. Nevertheless they cannot be allowed to associate random photos with unrelated content without repercussions. At the very least they should have a channel where the general public can reach them and they take prompt action based on the merits of the case.<p>It&#x27;s laughable how feudal, unaccountable, unreachable and unregulated the tech industry is, while they have a deliberately cultivated oversized impact on society.

            the pastor who did not write the book has access to the courts, it&#x27;s obviously a tort case and probably has affected her ability to work as well so I suppose that means Google should end up paying a lot.<p>The next person Google does that too gets even more money!<p>Obviously this thread is evidence in the pastor&#x27;s favor.<p>on edit: obviously the OP has been harmed by Google&#x27;s actions, but I think the pastor can show they have been harmed more.

            According to a lawyer, I could sue for “false light invasion of privacy.” Unfortunately, the pastor doesn’t live in a state where that tort is recognized. In any case, Google just fixed the knowledge panel-so thank you guys so very much for commenting and discussing my post! I exchanged dozens of emails with Google in April, then they just started ignoring me after that, all the while rotating images in the knowledge panel. A few days ago they had the audacity to send me a survey about my experience with the knowledge panel support team.

            one good thing about doing an &quot;Ask HN&quot; is that it can get so much attention that someone high up at google sees it and fixes it.  I&#x27;m glad to hear that Google fixed it.  Nevertheless, I still wish for legal action just to get a court precedent saying that these things aren&#x27;t OK.  I can dream, I guess.

            I would love to take legal action if I could find a brave attorney. During my consultations with attorneys,  they began speaking in half-words and unfinished sentences as soon as I said my dispute was with Google. I was willing to file the suit without a lawyer to at least force them to fix it. At the very least, I will be reaching out to law professors who are interested in this topic in hopes that they will start a conversation. Although I’m glad it’s fixed, I’m still really ticked off they took me and others through this for months. We all felt very powerless.

            &gt;I could sue for “false light invasion of privacy.<p>Yes you could sue for that but I doubt that is what the pastor should sue for, as you said she was threatened after being mis-identfied as you, they were told of their error, they recognized it and removed her picture, then they put another one in of her again.<p>I think the pastor should talk to a lawyer from her state as to what she can sue for.

            Knowledge panels arguably add a layer of authoritativeness. But your beef is really with individual names being used as a web search key generally (whether on Google or something else). And the reality is if you have a less common but not unique name, you may end up confused with other people in situations where the searcher isn&#x27;t really interested in putting in much effort to disambiguate the results.<p>The only real (imperfect) thing you can if it becomes a problem is to adopt some working name variant that is unique. But that only really helps if you do it up-front.<p>ADDED: You&#x27;re probably reasonably safe with a common name. No one expects Joe Smith to be unique. The real problem is when you share a name with only one or two people and they have a big and negative Internet presence.

            &gt; Unless the woman was already making good money as a writer before the picture, and suddenly wasn&#x27;t, Google will pay _nothing_.<p>The suggested plantiff is the misassociated pastor. Google is effectively saying that the pastor wrote the book, which is untrue and Google was notified of this and acknowledged it, and then they started claiming the association again.<p>This claim is damaging to the pastor in a clear way, and could probably get damages.<p>I would agree that the author would seem to have a harder case though as damages would be harder to show.

            &gt;&gt; and probably has affected her ability to work as well<p>&gt;That is NOT how the law works, or every writer who got a bad review would sue the reviewer saying it &quot;affected their ability to work&quot;.<p>I thought it was quite clear that I was suggesting that the pastor should sue, and that it was a tort case for her. I was expecting that being a pastor - which is a semi-public role that it might have affected her work.<p>At any rate a tort is in no way like a book review and if you have a case where your work has been affected that may very well figure into the damages you will be awarded - if it didn&#x27;t every medical malpractice suit wouldn&#x27;t mention how their client was unable to work for months after the surgery.

            It shouldn&#x27;t need to be like that but it is the case.<p>It has nothing to do with the merits of the case itself the tactic a company like Google employs is to just file reams of paperwork, discovery, delays, motion for this and that and each of them have to be considered and discussed and pushes thibgs out at least another day or two.

            You have an unrealistically negative view of the legal system. Google cannot just file unlimited amounts of paperwork and expect either the judge of the opposing attorneys to review it, if they tried the judge might well sanction them, but also it would just cost Google a lot of money for no benefit.<p>You can go look at cases involving Last Name v Alphabet on the recap archive, they are typically represented by a single attorney.

            This seems disingenuous at best.  Even on the very first day that Google launched if you typed those things into it, you would get &#x27;the most relevant responses&#x27; which is all that these are, a search engine providing the most relevant response to your query. At some point the tool and its underlying algorithms have to operate on a good faith assumption which this twitter person was clearly not operating on.<p>There may have been some tomfoolery going on with that twitter guy as well and&#x2F;or in the intervening time Google has improved the algorithms to handle people trying to get silly results. This is what I got trying to repeat his first query:<p>What year did Tom Hanks land on the moon<p>1995
William Broyles Jr. Apollo 13 is a 1995 American space docudrama film directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris and Gary Sinise.<p>For his second query, it makes perfect sense to me why google returned what it did (still returning the answer he got, but notice he conventently cutoff the paragraph of text that includes the saturn 5 rocket and the statue of liberty, possibly the only document on the web to have both in the same sentence, explaining why you got that return.<p>which rocket launched the statue of liberty into the ocean?
The Saturn V rocket
The Saturn V rocket was 111 meters (363 feet) tall, about the height of a 36-story-tall building, and 18 meters (60 feet) taller than the Statue of Liberty. Fully fueled for liftoff, the Saturn V weighed 2.8 million kilograms (6.2 million pounds), the weight of about 400 elephants.Feb 21, 2018

            Relevant according to whom? You’ve explained _why_ Google returns those results, but that doesn’t make the answers relevant. Especially not when Google presents them so authoritatively as knowledge cards (or whatever they’re calling it these days).<p>Sure, if you’re a someone trying to reverse-engineer the algorithm, then they’re probably pretty “relevant”. But that’s not how most people use Google. I’ll bet most of HN doesn’t use Google this way.<p>Maybe it’s a UI issue. It’d be nice if Google attached a little disclaimer that said: “These results are “relevant” to the way our algorithm produces these results, but there’s a chance they’re laughably incorrect, so please take with a bucket of salt.” Or better still, just show the search results, instead of being clever and pretending to understand what I’m looking for. Y’know, like back in the day, when it was such a delight switching from AltaVista&#x2F;Yahoo! to Google. Good times.

* So some percentage of errors, even horrible errors, are expected.
* And it&#x27;s completely unreasonable for anyone to expect otherwise.
* So one of their mistakes fucks up your life and you try to do something about it, you&#x27;re the asshole.

            &gt; no one can crack the whip on them, so to speak.<p>We collectively can by acting as technology shepherds for those around us, and providing better options. Not our job? I hear you. Technology is to be thought of as a tool, first of all--and a double-edged sword. I spent my high school years and beyond playing with it like a video game, but it&#x27;s getting&#x2F;gotten real.<p>In my experience they probably know who all of the potential shepherds are and have moats around them. There could even be instruments that isolate them via slightly &quot;negative&quot; biases that each seem legitimate when looked at through independent compartmentalized lenses, and amount to a &quot;false light&quot; being presented in search results through Algorithmic Fairness or similar. Their behavior could be manipulated as well, to look down upon those who they could help or encourage selfishness.<p>&gt; they cannot be allowed to associate random photos with unrelated content without repercussions.<p>Whole heatedly agree. I&#x27;m experiencing various attacks from various parties; having spent 3 years homeless with half of that during the pandemic, I have indeed been physically isolated and thus had disproportionate affect from algorithms--&quot;how am I presented to others?&quot; is literally life or death, as there is no option for a physical presentation. My way off the streets before pandemic was to get retail jobs and save, but that is no longer possible without showers and with the &quot;Simon Says&quot; rules of pandemic in play. The algorithms literally own me.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s laughable how feudal, unaccountable, unreachable and unregulated the tech industry is<p>Studying law around some of these issues in recent years, &quot;false light&quot; might be the angle to attack with for these cases. A person experiencing literal identity theft, meaning ruin being laid to their &quot;root identity&quot; (physical body and legal fiction name), has had a false light painted about them to their associates by malicious parties; seems similar, albeit it could be stupidity or malice from big tech depending how the algorithm &quot;views&quot; a person.<p>A new personal view is that South Korea did it right by requiring ID to get online. I was appalled when my university friends told me in 2010ish (plus a SK friend&#x27;s laptop was still confiscated at the airport upon return to the US). There is no way to fully recover a relationship damaged by a false light or impersonator, and effectively no way to get accountability unless we can get a service built around NSA&#x27;s alleged data in Provo that can catch the baddies and create an impact report or similar. Still, many topics have a &quot;toothpaste can&#x27;t go back into the tube&quot; nature about them, so one can only really move on from the damage without hope of reconnecting. IDs tied to everything could put the brakes on a lot of bad activity.<p>Concretely shepherds could start by distributing YubiKeys and RasPis, bringing back key signing parties, and starting RSS feeds. I didn&#x27;t realize how rich I was as a techie until I had to go back to living on retail money. I&#x27;d have invested a lot more into my Day 1&#x27;s if I realized how hard they have it--I went straight from my parents&#x27; house to a townhouse without renting by age 21, could&#x27;ve done more to rise the water for everyone.

            I think YouTube is Google’s only product that 99% of people cannot replace.<p>More and more people switching to DuckDuckGo as a default and using Google only when necessary would get the ball rolling.  Gmail is pretty replaceable with any other email, although I can see many people not changing from it out of laziness.<p>Google drive apps are pretty nice, but I doubt most people use them much at all, and Microsoft&#x2F;apple offer alternatives.  Google maps can eventually be replaced if people started using the alternatives more.<p>It will take time, but seems doable if more and more people keep changing habits.

            I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s actually a problem. To replace them, we don&#x27;t need to vacuum every single creator out of their ecosystem at the same time.<p>When the network effect shifts, it does it gradually with long siphoning effects, not all at once.

            &gt; but that&#x27;s effectively the same argument as the hassle involved with switching off Gmail.<p>huh? There&#x27;s a massive difference between those two things. YouTube provides discoverability for your content. Gmail does not. Besides the loss of existing viewers in a platform switch, creators would also lose a huge audience of potential viewers of their content both from recommendations and from search results. Sure, there are content creators who build up followings, but lots of people will get a handful of videos that become popular results for certain searches. Those come entirely from searches and &quot;related&quot; listings.<p>Further, changing emails doesn&#x27;t require people emailing you to use a completely different client to do so.

            Some people I follow have moved to Odysee[1], seems like a good candidate for helping wean users off YT. There are a handful of YT creators uploading content to both platforms simultaneously. That might be the best way to transition away from YT until the other platforms become popular enough to self-sustain. There&#x27;s a blockchain under the hood which I&#x27;m sure will trigger some HN denizens (I&#x27;m a bit skeptical as well) but it seems like a solid concept.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com</a>

            Honestly, I think he&#x27;s right. (Disclaimer: I work for Google. Not on Search or anything closely related.)<p>Anyone who uses Google Search often knows that the results you get are generally right... 95% of the time or so. Even if they tried their damndest, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to get anywhere near 100% correct. In fact, CGP Grey made the point in several of his YouTube videos and podcasts that even peer-reviewed, accepted papers and history books are sometimes wrong or based on flimsy evidence.<p>What Google search results tell me are what beliefs there are in the world. Many times you&#x27;ll get multiple results (e.g. multiple pictures of different people under Image Search).<p>Most of the time the truth itself is not super critical - I want to buy this lady&#x27;s book. Does it really matter what she looks like? - and when it is, I know that sometimes Google is wrong and depending on how much it matters, I double-check with other sources.

            Okay, you got me. I accept the downvotes. You&#x27;ve missed the point and taken it out of context, but I made it way too easy for you.<p>So I&#x27;ll rephrase: In the context of accomplishing a certain task, the accuracy of some information is crucial and the accuracy of other information is not. For instance, if I&#x27;m looking to buy a book about Andrea&#x27;s experience, I care that she&#x27;s a woman, that she lives in a western country similar to my own. It doesn&#x27;t particularly matter to me, in this context, what she looks like, so if I see the wrong photo - it&#x27;s no big deal.<p>Obviously, the truth matters. And Google can&#x27;t know what context you care about. But the only way to never be wrong is to never show anything at all. In other words, if you try to be useful and aggregate and show any information at all, you&#x27;re going to be wrong here and there.<p>Yes, Google should continue working and improving and getting to as high an accuracy as possible, but it&#x27;s never going to be 100%.

            &gt; You&#x27;ve missed the point and taken it out of context<p>1. I find the original quote, at least as presented without additional context, pretty difficult to see as anything but nonsensical. You following it up with &quot;Honestly, I think he&#x27;s right&quot; and &quot;Most of the time the truth itself is not super critical&quot; is leaning into the same nonsensical position even if you try to cover it with additional context of, well actually there&#x27;s still useful information.<p>2. This post is specifically about a woman (or in fact several) who have been harmed from this notion of truth not being critical. And you&#x27;re doubling down on this with a not so relevant view centered around how it&#x27;s benefiting you and not about the collateral damage. No one is saying perfect information is possible, but in the very least Google needs to be responsible for negatively affecting people&#x27;s lives and it needs to provide an easy and reliable way to address situations like this.

            &gt; So I&#x27;ll rephrase: In the context of accomplishing a certain task, the accuracy of some information is crucial and the accuracy of other information is not. For instance, if I&#x27;m looking to buy a book about Andrea&#x27;s experience, I care that she&#x27;s a woman, that she lives in a western country similar to my own. It doesn&#x27;t particularly matter to me, in this context, what she looks like, so if I see the wrong photo - it&#x27;s no big deal.<p>This is a cherry-picked task. If we switch the task from &quot;I&#x27;m looking to buy a book about Andrea&#x27;s experience&quot; to &quot;I&#x27;m looking to know more about Andrea, including <i>what she looks like</i>&quot; then the Google response is worse than an irrelevant one: it is a definitely wrong answer.<p>And our new task isn&#x27;t something unlikely or fanciful: there are surely people who have read her book who want to know more about her and who might google her.<p>Google will surely remove this as they should.

            In that case, the information itself isn&#x27;t important either. If it&#x27;s wrong and it doesn&#x27;t matter, why is it even being displayed? By definition then, the only people wrong information matters to are the ones it affects. &quot;It&#x27;s no big deal&quot; to you, but she has been working for <i>years</i> to get this fixed.<p>&gt; the only way to never be wrong is to never show anything at all.<p>How much error does this excuse?

            Let me edit that for you slightly:<p>&gt; Most of the time the truth itself is not super critical - I want to harass the author of this book.

Falsely identifying the author after she has <i>repeatedly</i> tried to get it corrected, which has resulted in unrelated people being &quot;attacked&quot; (their words) is an unmitigated ill.

If one of your family member was affected like this by a service provider who you have no control over, how would you feel?<p>This is an over-reaction. Someone being inconvienced is something you think should affect people&#x27;s conscience? And it seems like OP could take control here and do something. They allow people to claim a knowledge panel however OP seems to only ask for things to be changed in a knowledge panel. It seems to me they provide the tools for OP to solve the issue but OP refuses to do so. I also wonder if OP choose to flag a problem or issue a legal removal request.<p>I doubt very much that you sit there and feel shame and contemplate how you have inconvienced others and even when you&#x27;ve done so in a more purposeful way.

            but what if you don&#x27;t want to be identified? Because to claim panel you most probably have to provide some evidence it is you.
on the other hand, what if you don&#x27;t know&#x2F;don&#x27;t care about some google panel about you. But other people get harmed by it? If someone really lost their job just because his photo was attached. Who should be blamed and how this person should fix this if there is no tools to remove panel?
So I don&#x27;t see this as overreaction. If you make something that can do mistakes that can cost someone their job or harm significantly, you should provide some ways it can be fixed fast. And not via months of talking with a wall.

            there is a woman getting threats and harassment, (a woman that has absolutely nothing to do with the book&#x2F;panel mind you) because of the knowledge panel not working as intended, and that is fine in your eyes because the op can post a photo of herself?(when she clearly said she doesn&#x27;t want it online) are you intentionally being a devil&#x27;s advocate?

            * OP choose to write and publish a book.<p>* It&#x27;s subject matter makes it very clear there would be angry people.<p>* OP choose to publish this under a name that is linked to lots of other people.

So for a search engine to do anything someone has to do the work to create it. Now search engines allow you to search the web and return GUESSES on that information. It guesses using algorithms and for the most part work well.

Google has 3 ways to deal with the incorrect data here! THREE! Not just one way! Not even just TWO ways. But three ways! One of those ways you control the data and YOU BECOME THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE.<p>Why you think that doing nothing about a problem when given multiple options WHILE OTHER PEOPLE ARE BEING HARRASSED BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID is acceptable, I have no idea.

            Used to be, you could write a book under your own name, and there was nobody who published someone else&#x27;s photo claiming that person was the author of your book. Now, if you write a book under your own name, could be somebody will publish someone else&#x27;s photo claiming that person is the author of your book.

            Yes of course. If the actions of a collective group are causing harm to others, I expect members of the collective to feel responsible.

            Under the Berne convention all creative works are protected by copyright. And I see no license notice. So it would be a violation of copyright to copy one of these to your own web site. Unless there is some quirk of law that says these aren&#x27;t creative works because they were generated by algorithm or something like that.<p>But I bet if you asked permission and explained what it&#x27;s for you would get an approval.

            If I refresh the page twice in quick succession, the same image comes up. By refreshing on my pc&#x2F;phone at the same time, I managed to get the same image come up too. So it&#x27;s probably seeded by time.

            FWIW IC3.gov is how you start the process of reporting pretty much any interstate crime that plausibly originated on the internet. If you call the FBI about a scam that you found online they tell you to use the forms on IC3.gov.<p>As with many things that touch on legal matters submitting paperwork in this manner can be tremendously helpful. Having a police report, or having submitted a complaint to IC3 and contacting a companies legal department (mentioning that the report has been submitted) can provoke a stronger and faster response than you might get elsewhere.<p>In addition because Google took action to remove the panel previously there is a stronger argument to be made that they know what they are doing is wrong. So not only do you have multiple parties who have been either impersonated, misrepresented, or harmed you have an actor that arguably has admitted fault and demonstrated the ability to remedy the situation.

            You might need multiple people sue as a group. In this case it’s kinda lucky that on of the misidentified people is a pastor. She’s the one who needs to sue Google. OP in this case should do nothing, it’s terrible advise, but she isn’t actually harmed, she’s just a good person that doesn’t want to see other people harmed.<p>Help the pastor sue Google, she’s less likely to be tempted by a large amount of money and settle out of court.

            Provided you fit the eligibility criteria, I&#x27;ve had some success resolving this by creating a Wikidata element with the correct info (and picture), waiting for it to propagate to the knowledge graph API as a new entry (5-10 working days usually), then asking the knowledge graph team to merge the two entries: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;knowledgepanel&#x2F;contact&#x2F;posts_on_google_sj" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;knowledgepanel&#x2F;contact&#x2F;posts_on_g...</a>

            You can create a Wikidata entry and mark it as &quot;different from&quot; the other folks that it&#x27;s being conflated with.  Then the Googlebot has the information it needs to do the right thing.

            Yes, at some point she would still need to &quot;claim&quot; the &quot;knowledge panel&quot; for herself by complaining to Google.  But having accurate info in the community-curated Wikidata graph (that&#x27;s used by pretty much every Big Tech firm out there btw, not just Google) ought to ease that process by avoiding that &quot;Knowlege Graph&quot; entry being fed from less accurate sources.

            Another important notice. Ignore all suggestions from comments to provide fake data. Of course there are checks on Google&#x27;s side. It is trivial to detect that image was generated with convolutional neural network. It is trivial to detect that you have used already known to GoogleBot image of Sergey Brin. Google marks sources with many contradictory facts as untrusted and pessimizes them when calculating weights for Knowledge Graph. This is not a speculation, this is literally written in published patents.

            IANAL, and if you are I apologize for talking over you.<p>... But I doubt there are grounds for a lawsuit. Google is not impersonating the OP... They are stating an untrue fact in a public fact directory. I don&#x27;t know of any precedent for suing the phone book for misreporting somebody&#x27;s phone number. The back stop against such errors has traditionally been in the marketplace itself... A source of &quot;facts&quot; that is consistently wrong grows a bad reputation and is no longer trusted or used by the common person. At the broadest stretch of the imagination, they might be guilty of libel, but the victim would have to prove damages (if the damages are sufficiently egregious, libel can be proven without intent, but that usually involves statements &quot;vicious of malice,&quot; and I think you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to fit &quot;we think this is a photo of the individual in question&quot; into that category without blazing a hell of a lot of new precedent).<p>I suspect a lawsuit in the space would be a lot of money thrown at no beneficial outcome.

            If this is true it is more evidence of a broken legal system.<p>But the legal system is not fixed.  Culture changes and the context in which we interpret laws change.  There might not be precedent for getting a number wrong in a phone book, but we barely use phone books anymore, and market mechanisms don&#x27;t work.  I agree with you that it might be difficult to prove standing (the persons whose photos were used were likely to have standing, I think, but IANAL), but it _is_ important that we bring these cases to court and try to gain a new legal precedent.

            I suppose you can argue that these knowledge panels are uniquely bad. But any uncommon name that you share with someone who is plausibly you on cursory examination has the same problem--regardless of search provider. If a potential employer or date turns up &quot;your&quot; criminal history, especially for the &quot;right&quot; age range and location, a lot of people will close the browser and move on.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you fix that.

            I work for Google Search. Knowledge panels are automatically created and generated. And it is possible that if we have two people of the same name, our systems might select an incorrect photo. My apologies for the concern this has caused you. I&#x27;ll share more about how you can better get this feedback to us.<p>We allow for knowledge panels to be claimed. I checked, and yours isn&#x27;t. This explains more how to do that:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;knowledgepanel&#x2F;answer&#x2F;7534902" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;knowledgepanel&#x2F;answer&#x2F;7534902</a><p>When a panel is claimed, then when we get feedback about change requests or possible issues, we know they are coming from a verified source and can work better to resolve the issues. This explains more about that process:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;knowledgepanel&#x2F;answer&#x2F;7534842" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;knowledgepanel&#x2F;answer&#x2F;7534842</a><p>Normally people just don&#x27;t like the image we show, so we have a mechanism for them to upload a preferred image. That&#x27;s very easy to use. But in your case, I understand your reasons for not wanting to have an image used at all. I believe if you had filed feedback explaining that, the image would have been removed.<p>I&#x27;ll check on this further, but right now, I see that no image is being shown at all. So I suspect that we&#x27;ve gotten the feedback here somehow and taken action to block any image from showing at all. But again, I&#x27;ll check on this.

            Happy to read about your efforts trying to investigate the issue :)<p>Personally, I think that there are 2 separate issues: displaying&#x2F;generating such a panel (including a pic) + the correctness of the informations displayed&#x2F;generated.<p>Maybe knowledge panels should just not be generated for sensitive topics (e.g. identify &quot;sensitive material&quot; through keywords?) as in that context the potential for mistakes and&#x2F;or subjective opinions can be quite high. Or maybe panels containing potential sensitive material should be checked manually before being published and references to the sources of the text&#x2F;pics should be shown clearly (e.g. like Wikipedia does).<p>In general, it&#x27;s absolutely too easy to require the affected people to react &amp; try to get things fixed - people might even be completely unaware of &quot;bad&quot; things being shown about them on Google, they might just feel the after-effect of that. The mistake(s) in this case originated apparently at Google, the user had apparently no involvement with the generation of wrong informations, Google must fix it.<p>Cheers :)

            Hi! This may be off topic. There is a bug in Google Search for El Salvador for quite a while.<p>Every search query related to prices&#x2F;curtency are shown with the wrong local currency.<p>For example, this query, using a Salvadoran IP address:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=precio+bitcoin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=precio+bitcoin</a><p>Will show bitcoin price in SVC (Salvadoran Colon), the former currency that was phased out in 2001. The current currency in El Salvador is USD, so prices should be show in US Dollars.

Why is the burden on you to contact the publisher? And who set the law on that? Is a ‘phone number’ some kind of property which can be owned? …and so on…<p>If you want to fix the photo issue, I would guess claiming the panel would be the easiest way.
If you want to fix it once and for all, you should probably advocate for a law that would fix that. Asking nonsensical questions online probably not gonna change anything.

            While Google adding 1 and 1 together and coming up with 3 is a problem--especially continuing to do so even when they&#x27;re told they&#x27;re wrong--it&#x27;s not the only issue and it&#x27;s not uniquely a Google problem.<p>Name collisions of somewhat uncommon but not unique names were a thing long before there was a Web, much less a Google. A friend of mine in NYC shared a name with a local individual who got into a very public spat with the owner of a local sports team. My friend literally got death threats left on his answering machine.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the answer is. People should probably think more carefully about putting their True Name out there attached to writing and social media presences if they don&#x27;t otherwise want to have a public presence. But that&#x27;s pretty useless advice retrospectively and, of course, doesn&#x27;t help the people confused with someone who does want a public presence.<p>It&#x27;s easy to lay this on Google. But if you share a name with a few other people, especially if one of them is notorious in some way, you&#x27;re going to get conflated with them in searches by any search provider if e.g. a recruiter plugs your name in--so just hope you&#x27;re not likely to be confused with them.

            Yes, I know multiple cases of people getting attacked by angry mobs on social media because their names got unfavorable press attention that week, without any involvement of faulty knowledge panels. Sometimes drive-by attacks continue even after the subject pin a post clarifying that they are the wrong person to bark at. The problem is attacking people online (or maybe leaving death threats over the phone) has essentially zero cost.<p>The knowledge panel problem is easy to fix (by the right person).

            &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what the answer is.&quot;
The answer is there needs to be some sort of accountability required, where you can reach a human person who can resolve your issue. Under penalty of significant fines.

            For knowledge panels, perhaps yes. Google is presenting them in a way that people unfamiliar with how Google operates might think it has verified the information.<p>But if you have an unusual name but share $FIRSTNAME $LASTNAME with a couple other people and one of them has been convicted of notable $CRIME, that person <i>will</i> turn up in searches for your name. I mean, that&#x27;s what search engines do. It&#x27;s up to the searcher to figure out--if they care enough to--that you are a different person.<p>But if your name is Jeffrey Epstein and all someone finds when  they search on your name is <i>that</i> Jeffrey Epstein, I&#x27;m not sure what Google, Microsoft, or DuckDuckGo is supposed to do about that.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what accountability you&#x27;re looking for in a straight web search. (Again leaving knowledge panels out of it.) You plugged in a name and a search engine returned the most popular&#x2F;authoritative results for that name.

            How did you get in touch with Google at all?<p>They&#x27;re displaying my full name, along with an invalid phone number at my address on Google Maps.

            I&#x27;m not doing it for them. When I&#x27;m in a new city, i use google maps to see what&#x27;s what. Is that restaurant a terrible tourist trap? Do they have food that I&#x27;d like? You get the gist. Since i rely on it it&#x27;s only fair that i do my part for the other people relying on it. It doesn&#x27;t take a long time to leave a small review of a restaurant or museum, or correct opening hours. Certainly less than it&#x27;d take me to find the same information without Google Maps.

            I too am a level something Google Guide. It really frustrates me that Google is the medium in which we cooperate. I would prefer to contribute to an open, not-for-profit platform. Unfortunately, no such platform exists and if it did, I doubt it would be as good as Google Maps. Not because of a lack of programming, design, and other talent, but because the big tech companies have made it impossible to compete. With patents, control of user discovery (via Google Search), control of availability to users (via app stores and restricted capabilities such as Android Auto &amp; Apple CarPlay), aggressive undercutting&#x2F;loss-leadership (Google Maps is free to users but businesses pay a massive premium to be seen), wide-spread suppression of debate (say something bad about a FAANG? You might never be able to work there), and absorbing of potential competition (via acquisition of any small startup that innovates in the same space), it’s virtually impossible to enter the space and survive independently.

            Hi.  I saw the following link being shared here a few weeks back titled &#x27;Few people know that Google voluntarily removes some search results&#x27;:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27477797" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27477797</a><p>This is likely not exactly the same, but you can hopefully be able to either request this yourself, or guide the pastor to fill in this request for possibly removing some of this data. I know this isn&#x27;t exactly what you likely need, but hopefully it helps some.

            I saw the same re-posting of bad data in the knowledge panel early on in its days.<p>I assume this is what happened:  Google associated a local sports team with a stadium (old) that they used to play at, and then somehow associated the new stadium with the old stadium.  The names of the stadiums were different, addresses different, they were miles away from each other, addresses on the team website were all at the new stadium... but the knowledge panel treated them as one and the same and the location ... the location of the old stadium, and the panel even swapped names here and there.<p>I used their feedback widget a number of times to notify them. Then for a day it would be fixed .... and somehow whatever script or &#x27;ai&#x27; would takeover again and connect the wrong dots again and the address and names would be a jumble &#x2F; wrong.   I kept checking it as it was pretty amusing.<p>I assume someone at google had to eventually intervene, maybe many times to get things right, perhaps identify a wonky data set or something.<p>I assumed it only got fixed because it was a major location &#x2F; sports team.<p>It is probably amazing tech behind the scenes but the associations &#x2F; mistakes are just way too high to be left to the status quo of &quot;no customer service, too bad for you if it is wrong&quot;.   The human consequences in some cases is just too high.

            Andrea, I know personally how frustrating this can be. I&#x27;ve dealt with something similar with a relative&#x27;s Knowledge Panel, and dealt with this over and over with multiple people who&#x27;ve asked me to help them fix and update their Knowledge Panel.<p>The first thing that needs to be done is that YOU need to claim the KP. It appears that it&#x27;s not claimed right now, and you can have control over what appears there (and suggest edits&#x2F;changes&#x2F;updates). If you haven&#x27;t claimed the KP, then you can just leave feedback that seems to just go into a &quot;black hole&quot; and it&#x27;s never addressed.<p>I know there are ways legally to deal with this, but the best way to deal with it is to claim the Knowledge Panel.<p>Then, there are ways to increase the knowledge that is in the Knowledge Graph so that the information there is not confusing--they&#x27;re reaching for a photo, for example, and there are ways to overcome that. For example, you can use other photos (even they&#x27;re not photos of yourself) to get them to populate on the KG and of someone else.<p>The issue here is the Knowledge Graph doesn&#x27;t have enough information about you, so it&#x27;s just taking the next most &quot;prominent&quot; data that it has. You can help define the information in the Knowledge Graph by feeding it information. You don&#x27;t need to be &quot;fighting&quot; the KG, you should be doing quite the opposite: give it the right information so it&#x27;s correct.<p>The Knowledge Graph is not all controlled by Google--other search engines use it, such as Bing. The issue appears to be with Google&#x27;s Knowledge Panel, but the issue is actually with the Knowledge Graph itself, and not Google.<p>The Knowledge Graph is made up of sources (see the list here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalicube.pro&#x2F;trusted-sources" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalicube.pro&#x2F;trusted-sources</a>) and by working on your own KG entry and feeding it more information, you&#x27;ll be strengthening your own KG entry for your name, and all these issues with confusion and the wrong information being displayed will go away.<p>There&#x27;s really no need to do anything legally around this, it&#x27;s just a case that the KG doesn&#x27;t have enough information about to make the right decisions on what to display. I don&#x27;t see the FTC, BBB or IC3 helping in any way. Fastest way to correct this is to feed the KG the right information.

            Thanks for your kind words but I just wanted to say that  Google has to abide by the same rules as others who “publish” information.<p>For example, The New York Times cannot publish the wrong photo of a person inside of an article, then demand that someone turn over their driver’s license, a selfie, and other personal identifying information in order to have the false information deleted.<p>Btw, there was no guarantee they would have deleted it if I had claimed it- they said they would use their discretion. If you are going to publish something, the burden is on you to verify the information. If it cannot be verified,  it cannot be published. That is not my opinion but basic journalistic ethics and the law. The problem is Google is claiming their Knowledge Panel is simply a random search result and they are not responsible for it.<p>I didn’t want to turn over my personal information to a corporation that had already been careless in this situation.<p>Furthermore, it was clear that me and the pastor were two different people as both of us have been written about in the press and have different LinkedIn accounts. Also, once they saw their knowledge graph had produced several different results, they should have deleted the the panel altogether since it was clearly not working. To leave false information up because I didn’t “claim” the knowledge panel is unethical and against the law. Forget about the fact that they are currently being sued by 36 states and the Department  of Justice for unfair business practices. I wouldn’t advise anyone to give them a driver’s license and a selfie etc.

            I agree with what you’re saying, but one could argue that Google is not a publisher or a nees organization. The knowledge graph isn’t owned by google, it’s a collection of data that many sources contribute to.<p>If google were a publisher or news or media organization it would be different.

            Well, this prompted me to check out Google&#x27;s search results for my name.  I have a common given and surname, so, it&#x27;s no surprise there are a lot of people out there with my name.  If you just type in my name, I&#x27;m nowhere to be found in the first few pages. Almost all of them seem like just regular people, but there&#x27;s one unsavory character in the mix now who I&#x27;m going to be watching out for in the future.

            I suppose quite a lot of developers from Google read HN. Do you have any internal blog or some other social media to post this? 
Or google is so big you can&#x27;t do anything even from inside?
Because I worked in similarly big (although not so big) company and you can fix a lot just by posting such things internally. Because at the end of the day most people do care of such things.

            It&#x27;s really sad that we need to resort to shitstorms on twitter or hackernews to get simple problems fixed. Google is literally lying and spreading misinformation and causing harm to individuals, and we expect some random employee to raise it internally, because fixing one thing 4 times isn&#x27;t enough.

Not publishing a book with your real name would be a good start to not having uncomfortable things about your book or name shown on Google.

            Random idea which probably doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Let somebody create a pseudo realistic drawing of a imaginary person which is &quot;not you&quot; and try to make Google use that.

            Google sometimes does these weird things. For my company that I own, Google started showing a different CEO name on the google search homepage on the right next to business name. After some digging, I found out that we have an article on our website where that person is named as the CEO (one of our clients) and google AI thought that makes them the CEO of our company lol.

            In short term, how about using a AI generated face for her online profile picture, and let google assume that&#x27;s her real picture? It&#x27;s not the solution, but okay for time-being. In long term, I guess she could reach out to EFF or similar non-profit groups, or approach lawyers who had already fought similar cases against Google.

            How about you simply... provide them with a photo?

Maybe set up a website where you feature the same photo and promote the books.<p>Doing ridiculous things is often the only way to deal with ridiculous problems. This seems to fit all your constraints (i.e. your face isn&#x27;t visible online, and Google stops bothering innocent bystanders). That it isn&#x27;t really you - who is to know? What is the harm?

            My sympathies to the OP. As others said the authority that the Google misknowledge panel implies is the most worrying of all.<p>Can one claim and opt out of knowledge panel at all?<p>My knowledge panel is bare except for my birth date which is correct but not something I want to go around sharing publicly.<p>Can I remove my birth date from the knowledge panel?<p>Should I claim the panel and try to add generic information or just ignore it?

            I would consider finding a journalist that is interested in the story.  You should consider which journalist carefully, the wrong one might cause more damage.  If the story gets enough attention, it might make Google pay attention.  Good luck.

            AFAIK the only way to actually talk to a human and get a human to manually do anything at Google is either A. Work there or B. Speak to an attorney to begin serious threats of potential litigation. You don&#x27;t have to take it to court, but you need to be prepared in case it does.

            On the one hand I would suggest suing Google.<p>On the other, I would ask: Isn&#x27;t this better? Having someone else&#x27;s photo and location attached to your work means you would never be identified in public, not receive death threats, nor be at risk of swatting. And you get to keep collecting royalties on your duly attributed work in the meantime. It sounds like a blessing in disguise.<p>Please note, I&#x27;m not trying to belittle your experience or your work. What you went through was incredibly traumatic and deserves to be written about. I just fail to see the harm in this. If you really want to be recognized for your work, the fix is simple. Just supply Google with your photo and they will rectify it on the page.

            I&#x27;m going to give two pieces of advice, one practical and one more &quot;correct&quot; in a moral sense.<p>The practical one is to choose an image (abstract icon, conceptual photo, artistic silhouette that could be considered representative of you but is not you) and put it on your personal website as your photo, along with any other social media presences you have. Knowledge Base isn&#x27;t wired, at a very fundamental level of its design, to understand the notion that somebody would have no photos of themselves online and be known by people at the same time. The system is &quot;thirsty&quot; to fill that gap in data, and will continue to do so, forever, no matter how many times Google intervenes to manually break the link. If you feed it something intentionally to fill that gap, it will be satisfied (the system can understand a concept like the artist Sia not revealing her face in public as part of her aesthetic... It doesn&#x27;t understand somebody who has no photo whatsoever).<p>The alternative is to tell your story to media outlets and be very loud about this problem. You are not the only one in the world who wants to be online without providing a photo, and it&#x27;s not &quot;okay&quot; that Google doesn&#x27;t understand your use case and is building products that don&#x27;t understand your use case. A public discourse about this issue is the only way that Google will be incentivized to change the fundamental design of Knowledge Base and similar products. The bad news is that will be an uphill climb and take a long time (and, to be perfectly level, isn&#x27;t guaranteed to bear fruit... There&#x27;s no guarantee enough people care about this problem to make a big enough noise for the problem to be addressed :( ).

That&#x27;s awful, and highlights the need for human review and for flexibility in public documents, especially highly public documents like those displayed by Google.  However, what you&#x27;ve clearly demonstrated is that there is neither human review nor flexibility in these systems. Google doesn&#x27;t have a malicious employee with a grievance against you (or against the other Andreas affected) who is cruelly searching out incorrect images to display next to your name and your story to cause harm.<p>You were close to the root of the problem when you wrote <i>&quot;...to have a large corporation come along and continuously and consistently misrepresent my work and cause distress...&quot;</i> - the thing which is misrepresenting you and causing distress is an unmoral computer program. (Unmoral: Lacking awareness of moral standards, in contrast to immoral, intentionally rejecting morality, or amoral, aware of but acting without regard to morals.) The computer program doesn&#x27;t have a concept of distress or harm. All it knows to do is to display its best guess of a portrait of an author when someone searches for the author&#x27;s name.  It has no ability - was not programmed with the ability - to understand that sometimes there may not be a photo of the person or that sometimes this is not good. That&#x27;s still anthropomorphizing the program - it does not understand anything and does not know what is good. It just creates knowledge boxes with photos to accompany searches for author names, always.<p>When you contacted Google, the person who responded to you may not have been a person - instead, the entity behind your email was likely another computer program, designed to handle complaints about faulty knowledge boxes. If it was a human being (unlikely), they did not go to the source code file for the website google.com&#x2F;search?q=andrea and delete the \&lt;img\&gt; tag, nor did they add an understanding of the concept that some authors don&#x27;t have public photos and some knowledge boxes ought not include a photo to the knowledge box algorithm. Either the program or the human just flagged the first image as incorrect, and let the knowledge box program run as it did before and find another image. There is not (yet) a fault mode that indicates &quot;this person&#x27;s knowledge box ought not be accompanied by a portrait&quot; or &quot;this person&#x27;s knowledge box ought not exist&quot;.<p>What other comments seem to be suggesting is that tech companies ought not run algorithms that work well 99% of the time, nor fault handling algorithms that handle 99% of the faults effectively. I&#x27;d take a slightly more nuanced approach and suggest that instead, programmers and spec authors should consider fault handling first, and expected operation second. It&#x27;s very simple to follow the expected path, when you have to handle forks in the road it does get exponentially more complicated. Eventually, you always need a &quot;defer to human&quot; option. It would be prohibitively difficult (expensive) to defer to a human every time, or even 1% of the time, but that option needs to be available.

            I know this is not at all the optimal solution, but could you set a stick-figure drawing as your &quot;official&quot; online photo? And then just tell google that this is the photo they should be using?<p>I don&#x27;t know if it would work because I suspect Google has algorithms to detect faces and won&#x27;t let you set something that doesn&#x27;t look like a &quot;real&quot; face to your profile picture.<p>And setting a random stock image photo of someone seems like a bad idea. There&#x27;s software out there that can generate a fake face that might pass the Google &quot;real&quot; face test, but for how long? When Google changes their algorithm, will that face get rejected and then you&#x27;re back to square one.

            If you can prove harm, take it to court. In all honesty, I think you&#x27;d be making a mockery of yourself trying though. Google is a corrupt technology gone horribly awry and it should be obvious to all soon that there&#x27;s no remedy nor anyone who even gives a shit about the problems its materialized. Like, what actual resolution do you realistically expect from this?

            All I wanted was for them to stop placing the wrong images alongside my book, which they have finally done this morning thanks to Hacker News. Hopefully, the images won’t come back. Btw, there are authors who have knowledge panels with no images attached to them. So Google has written code&#x2F;an algorithm that allows them to create panels without images.
