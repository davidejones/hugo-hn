            As usual they don&#x27;t say how this was accomplished. They call it &quot;sophisticated&quot; but it probably was just stupid or lazy, which is very common in most corporate hacks. Big companies don&#x27;t really care much about security since it costs money and rarely causes much trouble to your stock price and exec compensation.<p>The people who suffer are those whose data is compromised and have no idea it happened.

            I can agree. At one of my previous employers, IT management was adamant that no password vaults of any kinds could be used. It was a bigger company with tons of various systems to get into all with different sets of requirements. So what was the result? Average user ended up storing passwords info in excel and text files. Yay.<p>I think only recently there was some movement to approve a vendor there.

Looks like T-Mobile hasn&#x27;t updated the OpenSSH installation (and thus probably neither OS) since 2014. SHA256 has been the default hostkey fingerprint since the openssh 6.8 release in 2015<p>Retweeted:

The person who claims to have compromised T-Mobile says the company misconfigured a gateway GPRS support node that was apparently used for testing. It was exposed to the internet. That allowed the person to eventually pivot to the LAN. Proof screenshot supplied.

            The EU has a federated public key cryptography based identity system.

            Wow, it exists. I dreamed about having something like this in the US, with the possibility of changing your private key if you visit the DMV. It would make a significant difference in the fight against identity theft, versus our current system of having a number of which only 4 digits are &quot;secret&quot; (and I hear those are sequential too. Worse still, they are the same 4 digits everyone asks you for).

            Doesn&#x27;t particularly matter how the DMV would authenticate you, the point of the electronic ID is to get rid of the exchange  of full copies of the identifying information. More careful re-assignment of identifying information is nice to pursue but also a completely independent issue.<p>Same with state vs federal question. Right now SSNs are assigned federally and drivers licenses and birth certificates by state. It doesn&#x27;t much matter which it comes from as long as the identification is trusted nationally (as it is currently with the above examples).<p>What DMVs are able to sell varies by state, many can&#x27;t sell drivers license photos for example. SSNs are also illegal to sell based on federal law. Ultimately that comes down to the content of the law relating to creating said ID not past actions with other information.<p>As for why we need to identify ourselves so often it often comes down to the public use case of credit checks and various forms of identification for governmental reasons (e.g. applying for official licenses or forms or travel documents or so on). It&#x27;s perfectly fine to do these 2 separate but as-is we are already tying the 2 together so why not answer both in one go with something like eIDAS.

            Well the databases are already there whether we like it or not.<p>Generally, with eIDAS, various websites can use an API to access the identity stored on your ID (public key) when you allow it.<p>Crucially, every time you want to make a legally binding change or sign a document, you need to ask your ID to use its private key to cryptographically sign it. Typically this operation needs a PIN. Without such a valid signature, you won&#x27;t be able to use someone&#x27;s credit line.<p>With a well designed system, the government can provide an API to give institutions&#x2F;apps unique, but app-specific people identifiers. Those can be trusted to each be tied to a unique person, without making it possible to track the services they use (unlike the easily trackable SSN).

            DMVs in the US already have fingerprint scanners; there exist physical documents that verify your identity and associate it with a face and name.<p>In this case, you&#x27;d have the Interior Ministry or equivalent be the certificate authority, and it can issue revocations and new certs based on the normal identity verification systems of the state.

            It is illegal for the US government to create a mandatory national identity system or coerce the States into creating one.

            &gt; It is illegal for the US government to create a mandatory national identity system or coerce the States into creating one. The limits of this have been pretty thoroughly tested in the US Supreme Court.<p>No, they haven&#x27;t. There are people who have speculated that it is illegal since the idea started being discussed (serious discussions are actually fairly new, mostly a burst in the late-1990s and another one shortly after 9&#x2F;11, though speculative strawman negative arguments go back a bit further, at least to discussions around HIPAA in the mid-1990s.) Those speculations have extrapolated from cases that are quite distant from a national ID (e.g., weirdly, critics of the idea have suggested a national ID would violate the protection of the eight to anonymous political speech found in the first amendment under <i>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission (1995)</i>, which aside from the WTF of what a national ID even has to do with that right, is clearly false because the First Amendment applies to the states under the 14th Amendment, so if somehow the creation of a federal ID would violate a First Amendment right, the creation of a state ID would equally violate the application of that right under the 14th. In fact, we <i>have</i> federal (directly issued or state-issued under federal regulations) ID cards required for certain federally regulated purposes, notably:<p>(1) Passports (or, for certain cases, state-issued under federal rules Enhanced Driver&#x27;s Licenses) for border crossing;<p>(2) Passports, state-issued ID’s meeting federal Real ID standards, or certain other federal or federally-regulated IDs for air travel and access to federal facilities.<p>There are <i>usage or production requirements</i> that government might adopt for ID that violate Constitutional protections that have been firmly articulated by the courts, but those generally apply to state and federal ID equally.

            No law so far ever required single form of ID to vote. All voter ID laws require <i>some</i> form of ID, which could be of many forms - driver license, citizenship id, passport, military ID, handgun license, special voter ID, and so on. There are many forms of ID that are accepted (and if you don&#x27;t have any, as much as a copy of a recent utility bill and a signed affidavit may exempt you from the requirement).  This is nowhere even near establishing a single nation-wide ID system, or even a state-wide one.

It&#x27;s not against the Constitution as far as I can tell, and you&#x27;ve done nothing to convince me; it just isn&#x27;t politically worth pushing for given the resistance it would face so has never happened.

            I suspect that for healthcare providers, the ID requirement is driven more by insurance fraud prevention (including Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid); i.e. the insurers require the providers to perform due diligence to ensure that the patient being treated is the patient who is covered.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any examples, but perhaps a provider who did not take insurance would be able to avoid the requirement.

            The Real ID Act has not been tested in court yet because it has not gone into effect, having been delayed a decade now. As soon as it goes into effect, lawsuits will immediately drop on several grounds. Furthermore, many States have declined to implement the part of the Act that requires them to share their identity databases with the Federal government, only complying with the &quot;identity standards&quot; part.<p>Prior Supreme Court cases have ruled that the Federal government cannot coerce the States, e.g. via taxation or regulatory authority, to do something for the Federal government that the Federal government is prohibited from doing itself. Without the voluntary compliance of the States, which is like herding cats, with respect to creating a national identity database, the net effect of Real ID will basically be more standardized State IDs.

Real ID are issued, and are required for a variety of purposes.<p>&gt; Prior Supreme Court cases have ruled that the Federal government cannot coerce the States, e.g. via taxation or regulatory authority, to do something for the Federal government that the Federal government is prohibited from doing itself.<p>Which would be relevant if cases had also established that the federal government cannot issue photo ID cards that the Federal government required for functions subject to federal regulation under the Constitution.<p>But no such ruling has been made, and the federal government issues a variety of IDs (passports, permanent resident ID, military ID), and mandates their use (allowing, in some cases—like commercial air travel—the use of an acceptable alternative) for a variety of purposes.

            To be clear, it isn&#x27;t that a national identity database doesn&#x27;t exist, they just can&#x27;t force you to have a national identity <i>token</i> (that is a power divested to the States). Several legislative attempts have been made to link that database to some other token that is <i>de facto</i> mandatory even if they don&#x27;t control it, like (currently) State ID. The challenge is, then, that they can&#x27;t deprive citizens of rights for not having a token over which the Federal government has no control. The States have not been cooperative in this regard across the political spectrum, albeit for different reasons. So at the national level we either have optional ID tokens, like passports, or mandatory IDs that are not tokens, like SSN.<p>There isn&#x27;t one court case that informs the boundaries of the Federal government and ID, and how the government may facilitate the linking of an existing identity token to their database, it is diffused across many. The policy and regulatory practice in the Federal government threads a convoluted path through this precedent, with myriad loopholes and workarounds, and exploiting gray areas that have not been adjudicated. I&#x27;ve worked in this environment, which is the only reason I know about it. Every time they create a database on US citizens, they must articulate the title authority that both allows that database to exist and to be used (use and existence are, somewhat dubiously, deemed separate authorities which notionally allows them to collect data if they don&#x27;t look at it -- this reasoning is not well-tested).<p>In practice, the US government outsources identity stuff to companies like Lexis-Nexis, which rely on duck-typing to determine identity since this doesn&#x27;t require the person being identified to carry a token. Just about everyone carries an ensemble of tokens that are sufficient for identity purposes if you have fewer database building prohibitions than the US government.

            Yes, this was the intent. However, many States have refused to implement the requirement to give the Feds access to their databases, even if though the ID conforms to standards, and the Feds don&#x27;t have a lot of leverage to force compliance.

            Smart cards are essentially a big Secure Enclave themselves.<p>The whole point of a smart card (same as a military CAC, and almost the same as a TPM chip on computers) is to sign operations using the private key, without allowing export of that private key.

            Traceability. I don’t know how it is in the US, but in Europe these days it’s relatively hard to get a SIM without having to show a form of identification. South-East Asia too, in 2013 they would just hand out SIMs like candy, but in 2016 the phone shop &#x2F; stall that sold you the SIM (illegally) just signed the SIM under the sellers ID and I imagine its even more stringent now.

            With today&#x27;s postpaid plans that have almost no way to get an overage, what&#x27;s the point of setting it up to require credit?<p>The postpaid plans are usually more expensive than prepaid, and they require a SSN and I&#x27;m not going to make the difference back by investing the payment for a month.

            When I asked about this on AT&amp;T I was told that prepaid plans do not qualify for some type of peering system that increases coverage and reception by using other carrier&#x27;s towers: I haven&#x27;t looked into it more, but if this is true this would be a potential factor in choosing post-paid over pre-paid. Would love to know if this is true for AT&amp;T or all carriers as if I can get pre-paid service of the same level as a post-paid plan I would make the switch.

            Carriers also have financing and&#x2F;or renting of expensive equipment (phones) as part of their post paid plans. This is a very big deal for many people.<p>Post paid plans can also have a minimum term&#x2F;termination fees, which the carrier would be interested in collecting.<p>Post-paid plans are also often grandfathered when prices increase for new customers.

            well depends while corona vaccinate-priority (right word?) was underway it was possible to send a FAX! to the healthcare insurer (not everybody allowed that) and you would&#x27;ve gotten a certificate for your priorty.

            Not sure what they do in the EU, but these seem solveable.<p>&gt; What if you lose your card?<p>Each country could keep a log of revoked publishable keys.

How do you prevent someone from reporting your card as stolen, representing themselves as you, and getting a new card (with a new PIN) issued in your name?<p>Governments need to solve the same issue with lost passports today. In some cases you can have other people to vouch for you, putting their own identities on the line. In other cases, you use other forms of ID (including immutable things like biometrics).

            No, the US has far more religious fundamentalists than the EU. They believe that such a system is tantamount to taking the Mark of the Beast, quoting Revelation 13:16-17:<p>&gt; <i>And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name.</i><p>Additionally, politicians who pay lip service to these beliefs have an extremely strong and malleable voting bloc. It&#x27;s a little crazy that a modern society is held hostage by such superstitions, but that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s been. Fortunately, we just this year crossed beneath the 50% church membership threshold and the numbers continue to drop.

            Yeah I remember all that backlash in the post 911 era. Contemporary America didn&#x27;t create the modern world or all the wealth in the nation. They were handed all of that by previous generations and spent the last half century squandering it all because of their short sided stupidity.

            Geez, such a weird segway. You&#x27;ve completely missed talking about how the EU private key has no concept of getting updated in a secure fashion and is basically unusable.<p>The Baltic states have a private key that is actually usable to an end user. Open source, document signing format that works.<p>Plus a process that allows updating these keys in a safe fashion. None of that exists with the EU infrastructure.

            Huh? I come from a religious upbringing and this just seems like an outlandish argument. Maybe <i>some</i> religious people would say that, but I hardly believe that would be the primary reason public&#x2F;private ID system in the US would fail to gain traction.

            Part of it too was that the original RealID Act actually did call for a national database of all citizens in the US, but this was later removed. Now it&#x27;s basically just a list of security requirements before granting the ID that is applicable everywhere.

            They fear that the ID, rather than being an easily stolen card, may one day become a chip that is implanted in the body... in the right hand or forehead. And that wouldn&#x27;t be a sin in and of itself, but the Bible implies that Christians will need to commit apostasy and worship the Antichrist to receive this mark which will be necessary to function in society.<p>So imagine a dictator, or a tyrannical government (say China) who said you need to worship Xi Jinping to receive the chip implanted in your body for identification purposes. Something like that they speculate. And that if you don&#x27;t worship Xi, you don&#x27;t get the chip, and you can&#x27;t buy or sell anything.

            Not exclusively, but Enumeration at Birth is pushed hard and I saw a stat that I believe said 99% of infants were enumerated at birth (it may have said that 99% of enumerated infants were enumerated at birth, however). This process began in 1987.<p>Since you need a SSN for a child to get the tax benefits of a child (as of 1986), and most parents will want those, it&#x27;s an easy sell to get a SSN while processing the rest of the birth paperwork, rather than doing it later. I was born before 1986 and I believe my parents applied for SSNs for me and my siblings around then because it was needed for tax purposes.

            They were not originally, but now they are. There is an interesting case of a Texas woman who was born &quot;off-radar&quot; to libertarian parents and had no government documentation of her existence. This caused major problems with access to services and employment in her adult life until a senator intervened and introduced legislation for the situation.<p>SSNs are not universal, either.

In fact, getting a social security number is the first step in applying for an exception from social security. Basically, SSA needs to track you as being exempt from social security, which requires a unique identifier.

            Fun fact, the &quot;beast&quot; mentioned in this part of the Bible was code for Emperor Nero. The mark of the beast used for commerce in this verse refers to Nero&#x27;s face on Roman coins at the time.<p>Much of Revelation was the early Christian community talking shit about Emperor Nero using code so they don&#x27;t get killed.

            I think the concerns around voting are based on who and how the ID is issued. Honestly if the Feds would issue one to every citizen this issue would go away. Most who are pushing the hardest for voters to show ID would have to give up power for that to happen, because the political calculation is that they can write the laws in such a way as their supporters can easily vote, and their opponents less easily.

            It&#x27;s not even that, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re doing so to give a religious justification to a stance that is inherently non-religious, knowing that the veneer of Christianity that they slather on their views will make it easier to sell.

            Whats the point of anti money laundering laws when you can open a bank&#x2F;brokerage&#x2F;crypto account online with $20 in Monero’s worth of fake IDs and social security numbers.<p>Could probably boost the GDP by 2% by just acknowledging that compliance is a waste of time and ending that regime.

            Going through a hassle is effectively being liable, in this context.  Especially when the credit reporting bureaus absolutely do not give a crap about you and make contacting them a job in itself.<p>It is akin to “the process is the punishment” when you get tied up in the US legal&#x2F;criminal justice system, even if you are innocent.

            So just have a prepaid option with the same plethora of plans as postpaid, and not require ID? Cut service instantaneously if not prepaid on time before 1st of the month. Or even add on a $100 deposit which buys you a 1 month grace period any time.<p>I don&#x27;t mind paying phone bills upfront at all.

            The bigger question, though, should be why are they storing the actual SSN? They can run a credit check and store only the result of the credit check and not all the personal data they had to collect to run the check. Presumably, they do need some way to report delinquent accounts to the credit bureaus after the fact, but there&#x27;s no reason why credit monitors can&#x27;t use a tokenized system (i.e. submit the SSN to the credit bureau and receive back a UUID which has the singular purpose of reporting back to the credit monitors.)<p>We really need to start attaching eye-watering financial penalties to companies that leak data so that we make the only sane decision be not storing that data in the first place. Collect it and shuttle it to where it needs to go...but under no circumstances commit it to at rest storage.

            SSNs sit in a middle ground between being public and private.  A large number of companies and organizations use it to both identify people and as proof of identity.  Those are two separate functions.<p>When I go to a bank for a loan, I should give them some form of private id as proof I am who I say I am (this doesn&#x27;t have to be a federally issued number).<p>When companies communicate about me with each other (such as running a credit check on me which is likely why T-Mobile even had SSNs) they should use my public id.

            The only reason companies get away with using it as proof of identity is because the government allows them to hit your credit report with a debt without having to prove you engaged in a transaction, and then make it your problem to prove you never did what someone else is claiming you did.<p>The solution is pretty simple, the government should require others to prove they engaged in a transition with you before being able to put an unpaid debt on your credit report, not the other way around.

            SSNs aren&#x27;t a great source of identity mostly because they were never designed to be - they aren&#x27;t unique, until somewhat recently they were issued in a predictable order, an individual can have their SSN changed, and since they are only 9 digits we&#x27;re going to run out of them on a practical timeline, etc.<p>They became a defacto identifier for many institutions just because US citizens and permanent residents generally have one - but aside from convenience, they&#x27;re pretty problematic compared even to something like a UUID&#x2F;GUID.<p>If you were trying to design a true national ID number, you&#x27;d probably want to approach the problem more like a database designer would: you&#x27;d want something that had possible unique values far exceeding the reasonable number of people you expect to exist before the collapse of society, that was reasonably random and difficult to predict based on other known attributes about the person, that by spec was never shared with another person, etc.

            If the US was capable of rational policy decisions, you could do any of a number of things to present a trusted representation of your identity without a “secret” 9 digit number.<p>We already have such a system, it’s called a passport, and it has complementary “cousins” like passport cards and nexus cards. That framework could easily be built upon, but there is a mountain of paranoia and stupid to climb first.<p>Instead we have the current system where fraud is endemic and where millions of people are marginalized by poor access to ID.

            I disagree here. There are innovative solutions for private decentralized encryption. Other countries have also already implemented similar solutions. Almost anything is better than a 9 digit number. The government also has the resources to hire some of the top academics. Companies have proven time and time again to only care about money. While politics is messed up in a larger sense, there are some divisions that are majorly effective and good at what they do.

            Or, just a thought, design an identifier where compromising one system doesn&#x27;t immediately compromise all the individual data contained within it. SSN breaches only really hurt because its exposure means instant compromise of identity, whereas a system with some sort of partial key, signature, etc, where the user retains a portion means they have to compromise the database and the user, and if a &quot;central&quot; system (i.e. government, private key issuer, etc) is compromised you can re-issue the user identifier portions.<p>If anything it might encourage companies to smarten up if there was a law on the books that required companies that get compromised to pay for the re-issuing of the user tokens to every impacted individual.

            T-Mobile subscriber here. I just received my first notification from T-mobile via a text message status that they have determined that unauthorized access to their data has occurred. They have no evidence that exposure to my credit card info was made (meaning they have no real idea). As part of their serious concern over protecting their customers and to protect my account, they changed my PIN. I&#x27;m no so worried about my credit card number as I am about all my personal info (name, address, ssn) being comprised to the point where identity theft becomes a significant concert. Somehow, changing my PIN doesn&#x27;t instill a warm, fuzzy feeling in me.

            If someone waited to make uncharacteristic high priced purchases exactly when these breaches happened, do you think the credit card companies would simply write down the amount without further investigation, being at capacity with legitimate fraud investigations due to the breech?<p>As in, could someone go out, buy things that would get flagged as fraud on their own card, then say they didn&#x27;t make the purchase when called by the fraud investigator, and Visa&#x2F;Mastercard would be too busy tracking down the bigger ticket frauds at the moment and then just let it slide and reverse the charges?<p>My personal integrity stops me from attempting this crime, but I believe it would work.

            &gt; If you’re a current T-Mobile customer, by all means change your account PIN as instructed. But regardless of which mobile provider you patronize, consider removing your phone number from as many online accounts as you can. Many online services require you to provide a phone number upon registering an account, but in many cases that number can be removed from your profile afterwards.<p>&gt; Why do I suggest this? Many online services allow users to reset their passwords just by clicking a link sent via SMS, and this unfortunately widespread practice has turned mobile phone numbers into de facto identity documents. Which means losing control over your phone number thanks to an unauthorized SIM swap or mobile number port-out, divorce, job termination or financial crisis can be devastating.<p>Hmmm, I get why he says this, but what is the practical scenario here? We remove phone numbers from accounts after we make them? But doesn&#x27;t that just mean we disable 2FA, making our accounts less secure and therefore more likely to be compromised by other means?

When the data gets stolen, it would not contain the sensitive data, since that would be in a non-readable format.

            Vodafone is much worse than T-Mobile. In Germany they forge customer signatures and edit voice call records to create &quot;fake&quot; contracts and extract money from you.

            Is there a reason that these social security numbers are persisted? I can understand the need to do a credit check for a new customer but after? The only use case I can possibly come up with is for customers looking to add additional lines to the account than what was originally approved for and thus needing a credit check re-run. But at that point it would be a more secure process to just ask customers for them again.

            Who knows, but it might be that no credit card numbers were stolen.<p>If you want to accept credit card payments, the industry requires PCI compliance (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Sec...</a>), which actually does involve taking substantial steps to protect those card numbers. An outside organization does some amount of validation that you&#x27;re handling the card numbers in a reasonable way.<p>There&#x27;s a difference here, which is that if personal details like names, date of birth, and driver&#x27;s license are leaked, it affects individuals&#x27; interests. But if card numbers are leaked, it affects the interests of huge corporations.<p>Those corporations have the resources and power to get involved and protect their interests in a way that consumers don&#x27;t.
