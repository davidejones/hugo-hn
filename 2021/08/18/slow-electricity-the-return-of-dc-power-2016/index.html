            So, I used to be &quot;team DC&quot; as well, but after learning up a bit, I realized there are still a lot of advantages to AC in the 21st Century.<p>One reason DC power is more viable nowadays is (as others here have mentioned) the use of DC-DC converters. They internally actually use AC to do the conversion (usually at much higher frequency to save weight and cost on inductive elements). But they&#x27;re not super cheap (not cheaper than transformers) and they can also be inefficient.<p>But part of my problem with this article is it kind of sandbags the efficiency. We can get pretty high efficiency inverters and rectifiers. &gt;90% is common and 95-98% is feasible (and not uncommon). Low voltage DC (like 12V) requires MUCH thicker cables for the same power, which means a lot more copper (and copper mining). Typical line voltage can be very lightweight.<p>With DC, nothing is really at the same voltage, so you need DC-DC converters all over anyway, so you&#x27;re not saving anything (although not losing much, either!).<p>Another important thing that really drives some of the advantages is: breakers, relays, and (much less important) current measurements of existing cables. All these are feasible for both DC and AC, but cheaper and easier with AC. AC is self-extinguishing as it crosses zero 120 times a second. That means you can switch a circuit on or off when the applied voltage is very low, meaning you can use cheaper and lighter power electronics. Plus, at a given voltage, there&#x27;s a safety advantage as arcs will more easily stop with AC.<p>I actually think it&#x27;s funny to see this in a &quot;low tech&quot; blog. DC ubiquity is something really only practical for significant use (i.e. beyond automotive or RV) with modern 21st century power electronics.

            DC is used where you want direct battery backup, meaning the battery bank voltage is directly supplied to the equipment. This makes the system more reliable as there are no power supplies or inverters to fail. The system can then be composed of simple fuses, breakers, switches and relays to control power flow.<p>You can even design the system so that the batteries are in parallel with the power supply and load making the system uninterruptible by default.<p>A lesser known standard is 110V DC used in electrical substations and switchgear. They cover a lot of ground and cable runs can be hundreds of meters so the higher voltage allows longer distances with minimal line loss.

            12V has been standard in auto&#x2F;marine for quite some time. There are plenty of consumer items that already run on 12V.<p>Power hogs like refrigerators, window-AC units would no doubt still run on 110&#x2F;220.<p>But I already have mixed voltage AC in my home: otherwise 110V but purpose-placed 220V for electric stove&#x2F;oven (in kitchen) and electric clothes dryer (in garage).<p>In my perfect future only those high-current outlets would remain — the rest of the house would have 12V plugs and lighting.

            There is more and more 24V in marine systems to deal with higher loads in recent years.

Typical line voltage can be very lightweight.<p>Yes, a low voltage DC bus doesn&#x27;t make much sense except for specific applications. Even in small spaces like recreational boats it&#x27;s more common to use 24V or 48V these days. I think around 50V makes sense, as it&#x27;s not very dangerous so there are fewer safety regulations. Look at PoE, for example. Unprotected runs of fairly thin cable transmitting up to 52V.<p>&gt; With DC, nothing is really at the same voltage, so you need DC-DC converters all over anyway, so you&#x27;re not saving anything (although not losing much, either!).<p>DC-DC buck converters are the simplest, cheapest, and most efficient category of power converters at the moment. (Of course a specific converter may be worse than a specific converter of a different category, but this is broadly true) Buck converters that support up to 50V are only marginally more expensive than lower-voltage ones. As an electronics engineer, I would be very happy if I could get away with only needing buck converters from now on; they&#x27;re very easy.<p>If the DC source is required to be galvanically isolated and to have it&#x27;s own transient suppression than the DC devices can get away with much less input protection than AC devices require. Could be a significant cost savings.<p>&gt; Another important thing that really drives some of the advantages is: breakers, relays, and (much less important) current measurements of existing cables. [...]<p>Absolutely. I don&#x27;t see high voltage&#x2F;high power DC becoming popular in homes any time soon for that reason. There shouldn&#x27;t be any difficulty with arcing at 50V though. (Yes, switch contacts still arc but it&#x27;s not any more difficult than 120VAC) Also high power applications in houses tend to work just fine on AC (motors and restive heaters), though that may be a chicken-and-egg thing.

            DC-DC converters can be much simpler than PFC [0] AC-DC converters.<p>There are actually scant few things in modern houses that inherently want to run on 60Hz single phase AC - basically just fixed-speed induction motors [1]. And the amount of those are shrinking as more and more appliances get &quot;inverter&quot; technology for the energy savings.<p>The transformers on the poles are bona fide 60 Hz devices (and I&#x27;ll take the electricity I can get). Industrial customers with large 3 phase induction motors want 60Hz AC. But for household use, DC would be straightforward.<p>I agree about the self-extinguishing arcs, although it seems like moving to solid state switches would solve much of that.<p>[0] power factor correction<p>[1] And actually, &quot;single phase&quot; induction motors don&#x27;t even want to run off of a single phase. They all contain capacitors to create a second phase so the motor rotates.

             But internally, devices operate at different voltages due to fundamental differences in required voltages for their transistors, LEDs, battery cells of different chemistry and charge state, etc. There’s not much getting around it in a strict sense, although standardization can help.

            USB PD works because they can assume very short distances.  It wouldn&#x27;t work for anything longer than a few meters, and it isn&#x27;t clear you can safely scale it up to longer distances or higher voltages.

            There are inherent factors, though.<p>1. Any time you mix motors and electronics, motors produce brownouts and spikes which can cause directly connected electronics to malfunction. DC-DC converter mitigates that. LEDs are particularly prone to overload with just minute increase in voltage and dim&#x2F;flicker with decrease.<p>Not inherent to DC but same thing happens with poorly designed appliances that emit RF which then interferes with everything connected to the circuit.<p>2. Voltages. You can&#x27;t standardize electronics power supply to 12V because semiconductors are most efficient at lower voltage, which depends on particular technology.

            I read the whole article with sympathetic interest, until the conclusion:<p>&gt; One way to solve the problem of high power devices is simply not to use them -- this is the approach that&#x27;s followed in sailboats, motorhomes and caravans<p>&gt; Obviously, this strategy implies a change in our way of life. It would mean that electricity is used only for lighting, electronics and refrigeration, while non-electric alternatives are chosen for all other appliances. Not coincidentally, this is quite similar to how DC grids were operated in the late nineteenth century, when the only electric load was for lighting -- first arc lamps and later incandescent bulbs.<p>&gt; Thus, no dishwasher, but doing the dishes by hand. No washing machine, but doing the laundry in a laundromat or with a manually operated machine. No tumble dryer, but a clothes line. No convenient and time-saving kitchen appliances like electric kettles, microwaves and coffee machines, but a traditional cooking stove operated by (bio)gas, a solar cooker, or a rocket stove. No vacuum cleaner, but a broom and a carpet-beater. No freezer, but fresh ingredients. No electric warm water boiler, but a solar boiler and a small wash at the sink if the sun doesn&#x27;t shine. No electric car, but a bicycle.

            &quot;Simply eschew modern conveniences and spend hours each week beating your clothes against a rock&quot;<p>My question is, if those people actually tried that by themself before suggesting it, or if they just picture the women doing it somewhere.<p>I mean in this specific instance I can imagine they tried.

            &gt;  instead of grocery shopping twice a month, ditch that wasteful freezer and walk to the farmers&#x27; market<p>Middle class Victorians, in England at least, had things delivered.  I imagine that quite a lot of cosplay characters are middle class.<p>In fact food delivered to homes of all types was a normal feature of life in England when I was a child in the 50s and 60s.

            I definitely don&#x27;t spend as much time doing chores as my grandma used to do before she had electricity. Recall that not too long ago &quot;sewing your own clothes&quot; also was a chore you had to do, and washing clothes took a whole day.

            Yeah was a really, really interesting social change. From the point of view of the middle class (~10% of the population of the wealthier nations?) when the appliances came in the station of women of that class went backwards. Servants became expensive and women who, post-childbirth had high-status and important roles running charities, political parties and such no longer had enough time for it. The suffragettes now had to do the work (assisted by appliance) of the house as well as run it.<p>Not many of us would reverse the changes that came with widespread home appliance availability and adoption on either a personal or societal level but every significant change comes at a cost to someone to whom you might well be sympathetic is something worth remembering when looking forward.

            I grew up in Russia in 70th and 80th, and most people around me were wearing the same cloths all week long. On Saturday you would have a bath and done a fresh set of underwear at least, perhaps a shirt too.<p>Women typically would change a bit more often, and generally tried to have fresh panties every day (they would wash them separately from the main laundry). Men who considered themselves sophisticated would change _socks_ every day, but this was a minority. Nobody washed a shirt that they only wore once. Nobody washed pants until they had visible spots or smelled really bad.<p>And these were civilized XX century households, with access to hot and cold running water, gas, and electricity (but not always a bath or a shower, and rarely a washing machine).<p>Try wearing the same briefs and socks and shirt for a week, and you will show much you reduce your laundry load...

To think that all basic needs can be covered by a 3-5 hours of work a day is quite shocking for a judeo-christian that has been indoctrinated in the &quot;work as a curse&quot; tale.<p>For sure it all depends on how you define &quot;basic needs&quot;, and how do you divide &quot;work time&quot; from &quot;leisure time&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Original_affluent_society#%22Work_time%22_and_%22leisure_time%22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Original_affluent_society#%22W...</a><p>At some moment I&#x27;ve heard of more recent studies about the myth of the increase in leisure time, but I don&#x27;t manage to find any good reference now.

            There are two variables, time and cleaning standards.  People clean to a higher standard with modern tools in general (in general, but not in all specifics).<p>My grandma took a bath&#x2F;shower once a week - she grew up when a bath meant bringing water in from outside by hand, heating it on a fire, and then you had to bring it back outside to dump it - I sometimes shower twice a day, and I still use less effort over a week to get clean than my grandma did back in the day.

            An hour of labor with modern tech is far more productive than an hour of labor with 1890 tech.  The modern person can perform far more work in the same time or the same work in less time.  Even if you split the difference the net result when applied to chores is a much cleaner household.

            I haven&#x27;t watched this video in a while so apologies if it&#x27;s not specifically elaborated on, but I believe it&#x27;s covered here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_rBO8neWw04" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_rBO8neWw04</a><p>From memory yes, it&#x27;s partially about water usage, but dishwashers are in general just pretty good overall about efficiently using energy to maximize &quot;food grime removed&quot; per unit of resources fed in. Even if you&#x27;re careful with water usage while hand washing, I think a decent dishwasher will beat you.<p>Another advantage is the dishwasher heats its own water, whereas with hand washing either you need to use a house-wide water heater or preheat water in a kettle or something, which will have its own energy wastes.

            See my other post: agriculture water is not heated or treated.  Thus cities use as much energy for their water despite only using a fraction. In all of the above water itself is not the issue as it isn&#x27;t lost, just moved downstream until the water cycle (rain - which has always been non-uniform) brings it back.

            IF this was about water I agree with you.  However it isn&#x27;t actually about water it is about water heating. Hot water cleans better than cold, but it takes energy to heat water and that affects everyone (global warming).  Thus less water is better.<p>There are also some water pumping and treatment costs (more energy), but they can be ignored as insignificant.

            I didn&#x27;t downvote -- it&#x27;s fair to be skeptical that a machine that spends hours making loud whirring noises would be more efficient than just scrubbing some dishes in the sink.

            In my observation unfair downvotes come, when people are angry at something and looking at anything that looks like a scapegoat to direct that anger, which can be anyone not expressing the same mindset they have.

I would not worry about it too much and try to not take it personal.<p>Their rational explanation is probably &quot;how you can be so stupid for not knowing that common knowledge&quot;.<p>And well, even though I am indeed a treehugger, I also knew about the efficency of dishwashers before and also assumed it to be common knowledge, but I would never downvote someone because of a genuine question adding to the conversation.

            Dish washers do reuse the same water far more than most humans would because it looks like you are washing dishes with filth. Most usually only run 3 small batches of water through them I believe. Not sure if it actually makes them more resource efficient versus mindful hand washing, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider them inefficient at all.

            &gt; <i>Is it about water use? What if you don’t run the water while you soap your dishes and only rinse them in a rinse tub?</i><p>Yes: if your dishwasher has the Energy Star rating then it must use ≤15L of water using the normal cycle per the EPA. This is half the volume of a small sink and a one-third or less of larger ones.<p>Most people run the water. In the US the average flow rate of a kitchen faucet is 8 L&#x2F;min (2.2 gpm), so you can quickly use up 15L even just rinsing.

            I grew up handwashing too but I disagree with your assertion.<p>Firstly, you can&#x27;t wash with cold water because soap doesn&#x27;t activate with cold water, hot water also kills bacteria and helps cut through grease.<p>Fats themselves are hydrophobic and without activated soap you wont get them off... enjoy your &quot;filmy&quot; dishes.<p>Second, humans expend a lot more energy than you think. The act of standing and using our arms releases varying amounts depending on physical fitness but averages somewhere in the 1kg&#x2F;h ballpark. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstage.jst.go.jp&#x2F;article&#x2F;jjphysiol&#x2F;50&#x2F;2&#x2F;50_2_199&#x2F;_pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstage.jst.go.jp&#x2F;article&#x2F;jjphysiol&#x2F;50&#x2F;2&#x2F;50_2_199...</a><p>Dishwashers use about 1800 Watts and are commonly run for 30 minutes, the average co2 in the USA is 0.92lbs per kWh.<p>Meaning it&#x27;s _basically_ the same.<p>Then there&#x27;s the freshwater usage, which is the real kicker, because dishwashers use significantly less freshwater, and freshwater filtering is the largest environmental impact of washing dishes (not the direct co2 output).

            I&#x27;ve worked in a cheese plant. The metal forms can be very greasy, and as the soap water cools off it is very noticeable that stuff doesn&#x27;t want to get clean. Heat the water back up, and stuff cleans far easier.

            &gt; Another thing people often forget about dishwashers: you&#x27;re supposed to pre-scrub the hard shit off the dishes.<p>Once you’ve removed the bones and massive solids, the modern dishwasher can do an astounding job on the rest. Put a little detergent in the prewash (or on a Bosch, just in the tub) and let the machine do the work. (I also grew up washing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. It’s almost never needed now, but old habits die hard.)

            &gt; Simple, instead of grocery shopping twice a month, ditch that wasteful freezer and walk to the farmers&#x27; market down the block before dinner each night.<p>This might be a positive though. Having moved to the UK years ago, the average trip to the supermarket is for around a few days of food, a week at most here. The supermarket is 7 minutes by foot or a 4 by car. It means we buy a lot more fresh items, and this is natural due to the limited amount of freezer space we have (60&#x2F;40 fridge and no chest freezer in our house). It&#x27;s arguably better than the experience I had back in Canada plus for the same quality of food, it&#x27;s much cheaper over here.<p>So it isn&#x27;t exactly the same as the olden days with wet markets and whatnot, but it&#x27;s much closer to it (they even have manned meat, fish and deli counters at our local).

These days I just take the magazine for what it is; a medium containing interesting ideas but overall disingenuous and often impractical.<p>(Though I do think that Americans uses clothes dryers _much_ more than they should. Most other G20 countries do not. In our household we hang dry any load of laundry that doesn&#x27;t involve our heavy blankets, and that usually ends up extending the life of our laundry as well, while taking just a few additional minutes. (See, &quot;often impractical&quot; not &quot;always impractical&quot;).)

            Not always using a clothes dryer is fine and good advice. But not using an electric kettle and replacing it with heating water on a gas stove is so beyond absurd I&#x27;m shocked how they even came to this conclusion since gas stoves are less efficient and much worse for the environment than a kettle.<p>And a kettle is so low impact anyway. It uses a high amount of power for a very short time and spends almost all of its life turned off. The faster you heat the water the less waste there is as it cools during the heat process.

            &gt; since gas stoves are less efficient and much worse for the environment than a kettle.<p>It is not obvious at all and requires calculations.<p>When you use electric kettle you use energy which was obtained mostly from coal and gas (60% of it in the US) and efficiency of the conversion is less than about 40% on average (limited by efficiency of a steam turbine). Then about 8% of this power is lost during transportation&#x2F;distribution.<p>When gas is burned in a gas stove 100% of its energy converted to heat. The only problem - some fraction of this energy heats a room instead of a kettle. But it is not bad if you had to heat room anyway (where I live 8-10 months out of 12 I&#x27;d prefer indoor temperature to be higher then it is).<p>I expect this loss to be smaller than 50%, but I&#x27;ve not found credible numbers for this.<p>Efficiency for an oven may be low because it measurably heats a kitchen, but ovens is another story.

            This has been studied a fair amount, from memory gas is in the low to mid 40% range, induction &amp; immersed coil are in the mid 80% range.<p>Gas stove is nominally competitive, but as soon as you start adding renewables to the power mix or considering indoor air quality &amp; venting, electric seems like the path forward to me.

            It should be possible to just heat the 1l of water in a kettle and in a pot using gas, and compare the electricity and gas consumed.<p>Time-wise I&#x27;d think it&#x27;s quite comparable, in my experience.<p>This of course depends on sizes and quality of kettle&#x2F;pot. Wide pot, with large surface area and a quality heatspreader on the bottom will get the water boiling more quickly. Also covering a pot is a must.<p>Sometimes when I&#x27;m in a hurry I split the water between a pot and el. kettle, to get a boiling 2l of water faster, and there&#x27;s no huge difference in time to boil.

            An induction stove is pretty much the same thing as a kettle for heating water. The OP post is against kettles because they require AC power which their solar panel and battery can not sustain.<p>But somehow gas doesn&#x27;t have to be accounted for and just comes for free.

            &gt;It is not obvious at all and requires calculations.<p>Heating water in a domestic setting on a gas stove is incredibly inefficient and you don&#x27;t even need a calculator to know why - put your hand adjacent to the stove and feel the heat being lost. This is not a small fraction, it is significant unless you run the stove really low and spread that heat over a large area.<p>Now put your hand and any point outside an electric kettle and see how much heat you can feel.

            Thermal loss of course bigger for kettle on a gas stove than for an electric kettle. But while electricity is generated on a gas&#x2F;coal powered plan a lot of heat emitted into the environment, and we cannot ignore this if we are interested in overall efficiency.

            &gt; Though I do think that Americans uses clothes dryers _much_ more than they should.<p>There are many reasons for this. Some of them are cultural, and other are legal.<p>Many Americans simply don&#x27;t remember drying clothes on a clothes hanger outside, and aren&#x27;t used to hanging them indoors as many Europeans do. And to be fair, indoor clothing hanging is time consuming in comparison to &quot;transfer clothes from one machine to another&quot;.<p>But what many don&#x27;t know is that it&#x27;s often banned in many home owners&#x27; associations, and banned in many apartment leases, meaning that hanging your clothes outside is actually a luxury that many simply can&#x27;t partake in.

            The HOA or landlord can modify the terms, but they&#x27;re disincentivized to do so.<p>The reason that both HOAs and landlords disallow outdoor clothes drying is that it&#x27;s seen as an eyesore. People associate clotheslines full of clothes with images of testaments in NYC in the 1920s and representing overpopulation and or immigration.<p>Landlords in particular don&#x27;t want people hanging things from the apartments- even objects like small satellite dishes are often not allowed.<p>What many don&#x27;t know is that in the US, many of these rules are simply null and void:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sightline.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;21&#x2F;clothesline-bans-void-in-19-states&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sightline.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;21&#x2F;clothesline-bans-void-i...</a><p>The challenge is that this requires a great deal of work on the part of the homeowner, and in doing so they would be entering into a conflict with the HOA. They would win in a court, but they would need to put up the money to fight in court. Even if&#x2F;when they won, the HOA would make life unpleasant for them and likely retaliate in some other way.

            Re clothes dryers - many Americans don&#x27;t have much choice. Most apartment buildings in the US prohibit drying clothes on the balcony (to avoid giving the impression that poor people might live there).

            Effectiveness of indoor hang drying depends on air humidity and circulation. In our previous place, at end of August indoor RH would be around 70% (edit: outdoor would be around the same so opening a window wouldn&#x27;t make a difference). In practice that meant that some of the clothes hadn&#x27;t completely dried the next day, and were starting to smell.

            In good income houses and apartments in Europe there is a specific place that is designed for hanging your clothes, that is not very visible from outside, like an internal patio, or an outdoor balcony with metal screens that let most sunlight and air go through, but you can&#x27;t hardly see from outside.<p>In those places it is typically forbidden to hang clothes outside their specific places because it is not aesthetically pleasing.

            You do have to wonder if they’re confused on why this isn’t persuasive to normal people. Go cook outside on a rocket stove[0] and washing clothes by hand every day? Come on.<p>Meanwhile the thing that has actually gotten people out of their cars is the ebike. It turns out it’s much more effective to produce a more convenient and comfortable solution for people rather than just demand that they go back a century or two just because.<p>0 - It’s also telling that such advocates never seem to actually say who should be stuck doing all the labor that machines like washing machines now do for us. Washing clothes and dishes by hand is hard labor, and someone is going to have to give up their career or free time to do it if we’re going to ban these machines.

While they&#x27;re always breathlessly moralizing, they rarely think through (or at least write about) the social ramifications of the changes they propose. They do have some interesting ideas though, such as the use of thermal cookers, and burning biomass in a rocket stove may not be the worst idea if you live in an area with a temperate climate and a dirty grid. Perhaps more practical though would be just incentivizing ordering at a restaurant, since a restaurant will be more energy efficient at preparing food than an individual will.

            &gt; They are probably not actually closet misogynists or anything like that, they probably just haven’t thought that far ahead.<p>I agree, this is more probable than the closet misogyny theory. But it&#x27;s still not exactly a ringing endorsement to say &quot;whoops, we didn&#x27;t think about who would have to do all that labor once we took away all those labor saving devices!&quot; It&#x27;s not like this is some hard to predict third order effect, after all.<p>Overall, the whole argument they&#x27;re making is kind of silly. Washing clothes by hand sucks, people rushed to buy machines to replace this labor for a damned good reason. If someone&#x27;s plan for the future involves persuading people to go back to doing labor the vast majority of people don&#x27;t want to do, then they should prepared for a lot of failure. Given the continued sales of brand new washing machines at my local home improvement store, I would argue that they have failed thus far.<p>(Ironically, there is probably a good lower-tech argument in making labor saving devices simpler and more reliable. The short lifespan of our appliances is both deeply unpopular and environmentally problematic, and doing anything to make them more repairable would both be good for the environment and incredibly popular.)<p>Back to their original argument, there&#x27;s a reason why I hold up the e-bike as an unqualified success that the authors here are incorrectly ignoring. Cycling enthusiasts--myself included--have argued for decades that biking is better and people should switch over to using bikes for more trips. Repeated appeals to the environment, the wallet, and ones health haven&#x27;t really moved the needle much in this area. Yet it&#x27;s the high-tech (<i>gasp!</i>) e-bike that appears to be finally getting commuters out of cars and into the saddle. It turns out that while moralizing is fun, actual change involves making compromises towards the convenience and comfort of your average person.

            Yup, I&#x27;m with you, lowtechmag has a lot of articles that seem unmoored from reality. There&#x27;s always a few good ones though. There&#x27;s one arguing if the grid was designed for 98-99.9% uptime instead of 99.999999% uptime, we&#x27;d a) survive just fine b) have cheaper power and c) be more resilient against power failure when it inevitably happens, which I found pretty thought provoking.

            And this is why it&#x27;s useful to check the literature, individual results might provide misleading anecdotes.<p>&gt; This paper reports on a review of the European literature about the impacts of having an electrically-assisted bike available to use, together with results from a trial in the UK city of Brighton, where 80 employees were loaned an electrically-assisted bike for a 6–8 week period. In the Brighton trial, three-quarters of those who were loaned an e-bike used them at least once a week. Across the sample as a whole, average usage was in the order of 15–20 miles per week, and was accompanied by an overall reduction in car mileage of 20%. At the end of the trial, 38% participants expected to cycle more in the future, and at least 70% said that they would like to have an e-bike available for use in the future, and would cycle more if this was the case. This is consistent with the results of the European literature which shows that when e-bikes are made available, they get used; that a proportion of e-bike trips typically substitutes for car use; and that many people who take part in trials become interested in future e-bike use, or cycling more generally.<p>The real key is that e-bike users will ride further, which expands the range of trips that the owners will consider via bike.<p>&gt; John MacArthur was the lead author of the NITC report, and told the Electric Bike Report, “While many of the rides we surveyed were for recreation, on average we found that the average trip on an e-bike was nine miles,” adding, “historically on traditional bicycles we see a trip of more than five miles being a barrier.”<p>&gt; Additionally, the electric assist of the e-bike helps to generate more trips, longer trips and different types of bicycle trips. These findings are represented by the high value attributed to being able to avoid or tackle hills easier, ride farther and faster with less effort, and being able to carry more cargo or children when needed.

            Given the rapid urbanization of America, that will not be true for long.<p>Assuming that the 9 mile limit holds, that is a pretty long distance in most cities. I live in the suburban edge of a small city, and downtown is only 6.4 miles away for me. Even when I lived in LA, 9 miles was more than enough for 80% of my trips or so.

            The rocket stove reminds me. I&#x27;ve seen lots of stuff on low tech &#x27;improved&#x27; cook stoves for people in developing countries. I think women in those countries would be happier served with a pressure cooker and a two burner induction stove running off solar panels. All horrible high tech, but actually cheap commodities in practice.

            An induction hob with a single ring&#x2F;burner takes anywhere from 1.3-1.8 kWh of energy. It&#x27;s almost impossible for the type of person that would benefit from a rocket stove to have access to a solar setup which could generate that much energy. Moreover, most of the time these families&#x2F;individuals are impoverished enough and&#x2F;or live in places with bad enough infrastructure that even gas for a gas stove isn&#x27;t available. In these situations, biomass rocket stoves make the most sense.<p>(Cooking actually takes quite a bit of energy unfortunately and is probably one of the hardest human activities to make carbon neutral. Luckily there&#x27;s a lot of low-hanging fruit to tackle first before the question of cooking efficiency  comes up.)

            My fairly large solar setup provides a max of about 6.5kW under ideal circumstances (which isn&#x27;t always when we need to cook, FWIW), but it&#x27;s far far beyond what a typical woman in developing Africa could afford.

            This is a low tech blog.

            DC-DC actually converts DC to high freq. AC 1st, then uses a transformer and then rectifiers, smoothing, feedback, etc. If no isolation, i.e. common ground is fine, a choke instead of a transformer is fine too.

            So do AC-DC converters. They rectify the incoming AC, then it’s basically the same as a DC-DC converter. They have a switch that produces basically PWM in the hundreds of kHz to low MHz range, that it punches through a transformer.

            &quot;Early DC power stations had a dynamo for every light bulb. Source unknown.&quot;<p>I have no idea where they got that picture either. Edison&#x27;s Pearl St. station did not work that way, and that was the first power station. The generator shown is Edison&#x27;s famous &quot;long-waisted Mary Ann&quot;. But Edison never built a one generator per bulb power station. He was able to calculate ROI [1]. This is probably some conceptual drawing of what would have been necessary had the &quot;subdivision of the electric light&quot; (a hot issue around 1889)[2]  had not been accomplished.<p>&quot;In other words, a DC electrical system could make a solar PV system more energy efficient.&quot; Not clear that it matters much in terms of raw conversion efficiency. Solar inverters are now up around 96-98% efficiency. If you&#x27;re going to have batteries, you need something that handles battery charging, discharging, and some constant output, and while you can get all that stuff for 12VDC or 24VDC, it&#x27;s not any more efficient than outputting 120VAC.<p>The real argument they&#x27;re making is to save power by using small boat or RV sized appliances. They&#x27;re available, efficient, undersized, and about 3x as expensive as line-powered units.[3]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hup.harvard.edu&#x2F;catalog.php?isbn=9780674423640" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hup.harvard.edu&#x2F;catalog.php?isbn=9780674423640</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;040152a0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;040152a0.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecabindepot.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;appliances" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecabindepot.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;appliances</a>

            DC wiring is already standard in many office buildings in the form of power over Ethernet (PoE). It powers access points, lighting, and infrastructure, and high power variants can do 100W+. Since it&#x27;s under 50V, the IT guy can install it without a qualified electrician.
High power loads like motors and heaters will continue to require AC but I see no reason why small loads can&#x27;t use PoE. I would love to see it take off for residential use, especially for IoT stuff.

            PoE is great, but it&#x27;s really a crutch: a workaround for when you can&#x27;t run additional wiring. Its main advantage is that you don&#x27;t have to use additional wiring.<p>The only reason PoE makes sense at all is because it uses 48V, but due to the flimsy cables the losses are still 15-20%.

            the thing to really highlight here is that having microinverters on the back of each panel increases overall efficiency when even a single panel is partially covered (either by leaves, poop, or damage)<p>otherwise you chain a bunch of panels together in series and  track the max power point there.

            Other commenters here haven&#x27;t really provided any good data to show the issue.  If you want to run, say, 10A at 24V through DC wire on a circuit you end up needing stupidly thick wire (~6AWG) to avoid voltage drops over just 100ft.  There are charts available to show you, for example [1].  If you&#x27;re thinking of running normal hobby wire for 12V circuits around a house, the resistance losses are going to be huge.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boatus.com&#x2F;expert-advice&#x2F;expert-advice-archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;february&#x2F;choose-the-correct-wire-size" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boatus.com&#x2F;expert-advice&#x2F;expert-advice-archive&#x2F;2...</a>

            What? 12AWG Romex is rated for 20A in normal residences in the US and it&#x27;s already in a lot of homes, so the retrofit would be easy. And for LED lighting you wouldn&#x27;t need nearly that much current at 24V, so voltage losses would be negligible.

            &quot;Rated for 20A&quot; means that putting 20A through the cable will heat it to the maximum rated temperature, which is ~90C for that type of cable.<p>Heating all of your house wiring to 90C is a) dangerous, and b) expensive. Even if you&#x27;re doing less than 20A, decreasing the voltage by a factor of 5 still increases energy loss in cabling by a factor of 25.

            My house was built in 2018. The smoke alarms are low voltage. I remember the electrician, who installed them, told me they are DC.<p>Thermostats and doorbells are low-voltage AC. The transformer is standard. If you can find 24-volt AC lights, an open-minded electrician should be able to figure it out.<p>Related: My old house built in the 1960s had an intercom system that was ripped out by a previous owner. I found a warm transformer attached to a bare bulb light socket in the basement with nothing else running from it. I happily removed it.

            low voltage is just not a good way to send high amounts of current over even moderately long distances, because low voltage means higher current, which means higher losses to resistance in your wiring, which means you will need much much thicker wiring.

            Look into country cabins, boats and campers. Especially the first though. Many are built with only solar for power. They have 12 volt wiring for 12v lights, and 12v outlets.
The only AC is if someone plugs in an inverter to a 12v outlet.
If course there are many builds with a main inverter next to the &#x27; battery shack&#x27;, and often 110 AC wiring from that. But there is a lot of information about pure 12v systems, and it is very doable.
The problem is if you are not doing it yourself and are in a city, to find a contractor. 
If you do a dual setup - I suggest using a different colour of wiring, for the 12v system. ;)

            That isn&#x27;t a great analogy because the expectation for electrical appliances in a boat&#x2F;camper&#x2F;cabin is much lower than it would be in most homes.<p>I had a battery fridge in a caravan (trailer) and it was very small and pretty rubbish, certainly not suitable for home. However, for a short stay, it could keep some basic foods cool enough to be safe.<p>As others have said, although it is fine on paper, as soon as you start talking about significant power, you are talking lots of amps, which means more risk of overheating and fire, potentially significantly larger (and therefore expensive) cabling and all of the switchgear that can support a few amps AC will not support the same current at DC so all your switchers are larger&#x2F;electronic. There is also an issue of RFI which could be significant if you are switching high current DC loads.

            Ignore the naysayers herein. Your power requirements are low enough that 12AWG wire will work fine. Wire your lighting circuits with standard 12-2 Romex, power it with 24VDC, and use LEDs. The only hard part is finding the proper constant-current drivers for your fixtures, but they should be available.

            I&#x27;m building a house where I&#x27;m doing exactly that. LED panels powered from a 48V solar installation.<p>We&#x27;ll see how things go, but on paper at least this makes a lot of sense if you don&#x27;t try to run things at 12V (why do people still try?). 48V is a voltage that is still safe, but cuts your amperage and losses to reasonable numbers.<p>While designing my own LED drivers, I found that most LED panels will internally work with a Vf of 36V, which you can efficiently get from your 48V installation.<p>Even in an AC-powered home, if you have lots of LED lighting in one place, it makes sense to use a single high-power converter to get 48V DC and then drive LEDs off that. Small AC to DC converters are inefficient.

            Low voltage electrical is entirely doable and no issues code wise.

            Indeed. This is because you get phase differences (due to finite speed of signal in wire, even though it&#x27;s near c) over those distances. Converting to DC and then back to AC at the destination avoids any concern about phase mismatch.

            It isn&#x27;t just that. afaik, a much larger issue is related to capacitive and inductive losses of AC. Even on the railways, an adjacent 25KV overhead line can induce a few hundred volts into the adjacent &quot;dead&quot; line, which is why they must be earthed before you can work on them.

            There are two main reasons for using DC for long distance power lines:<p>1) The line connects two synchronized grids. It&#x27;s much easier to convert electricity to DC and back to AC on receiving end, than to synchronize grids or to implement something similar with AC.<p>2) The line runs under sea water for a significant distance. Due to the conductivity losses DC is more efficient in such contexts that AC.

            I agree.
We also built and lived on a sea going boat.
You learn a lot about infrastructure to make yourselves independent.
As early as the late 70&#x27;s, we had solar connected to a 12v DC system. That allowed us to run lights, radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration or heating, for as long as we were at sea. Sustainable for over 2 -3 years - Battery life was the limit.
{Well, obviously food and water at sea were also a limit.)
2021. That system is still running! everything you need is in there.

            Well yes, but frankly given the small losses due to modern conversion systems being so efficient I think we&#x27;re worrying about catching that last small%age if energy losses.<p>As much as I personally hate them, would it not be better to install 120% of solar cells required to match the load upfront. Given the energy is free at generation write off this small inefficiency as being built into the system. It&#x27;s not like the sun will come after you for capturing more than your fair share.<p>This feels like a problem for 2100 imo once we&#x27;ve moved to much lower carbon supplies.

            Many of the loads discussed, eg washing machines, are also reasonable matches a local solar power source, as it&#x27;s much cheaper to buffer hot water than have large batteries.<p>(Water heating dominates the energy used in those, the mechanical sloshing around takes trivial power compared to it).

            I&#x27;m not sure I care whether it&#x27;s AC or DC, but it might be nice to have some parallel off-the-grid wiring that comes from a solar-charged battery and will run during a power outage.<p>What would work best for this?

            I’m looking at building a system based on a Victron Multiplus II inverter&#x2F;charger - first an off-grid system for a friend who has bought a large property with no power line hookup, and then my own system at home. It’ll just hook into my existing wiring.<p>They have an automatic transfer switch built in for anti-islanding (your mains entry goes through it), so it disconnects you from the grid if it goes down but your local side still operates. I think it can also have two AC outputs, one for loads powered by either grid or battery, and one that is only on when the grid is present (if you have a grid). You can use any type of battery so you’re not locked in (LiFePO4 are some of the best at the moment).<p>I have an AC solar inverter and 5kW of panels on my roof, which would be about enough, but I’m going to add another four panels (bit less than 1.5kW) that are DC-coupled through an MPPT charter (Victron SmartSolar MPPT) to solve the bootstrap problem for prolonged outages (which are very rare here, but still). Not sure if that’s the normal term, but I mean where the batteries run out, so without the grid to put some charge in them, the inverter&#x2F;charger can’t produce an AC waveform for the PV inverter to lock to, so the PV inverter won’t switch on. Having some solar on the DC charger lets that work.

            Why parallel as opposed to the same wires?  There are good answers for this, but for most people what is best second circuit box that runs just the fridge and a few important lights (in my case the well for water).  This way you use the same appliances for everything.  A parallel circuit implies when the power is out you have to use something different.<p>As I type this my house is running from a backup generator.  The power company has their repair crew in route to whatever the issue is.  I&#x27;m looking into how&#x2F;if I can add solar to the system as well.

            This gets complicated and depending on your local regulations, may involve an electrician to certify the work. It&#x27;s similar to the wiring that goes into adding a generator to your home. If you want something a bit less sophisticated but works nonetheless, you can try to wire solar cells, charge controller, and other stuff to a battery, and then just use the battery directly to power devices. Maybe even have two batteries, one being charged, and one being used. I&#x27;ve had friends do this setup in places where they&#x27;ve been renting.

            Yes, but the very most efficient AC motors and compressors motors use variable frequency drives, and you can design a VFD powered by either AC or DC.<p>I still do think AC is still advantageous in a lot of ways for power grids though, just not on that particular point.

            It would be both AC and DC.  Different applications do best for different things.  DC for long distance, AC for medium distances, and DC very short distances - exactly what we do today.  Probably we would use a higher frequency, but that is the only change worth considering.  Transformers are efficient and easy, and the things that need high power tend to want AC anyway (though they are moving to VFD which can use DC).<p>The biggest factor is AC is a lot safer.  Switches and branch protection devices (fuses) work best on AC.  For low voltage DC we can make them work, but for high voltages we don&#x27;t - instead we put in the protection on an AC side, then convert that to DC.

            Yes, USC-C with PD is the winning idea for DC infrastructure. All new homes should come with PD outlets. The outlets could be fed with 12 gauge copper and the PD electronics should be built in to the individual outlets.

            Low-voltage DC for long wire runs is kind of wasteful -- you either lose a lot of energy in the wires or you need extra thick cables, so I wonder if the best way to do this is to have a high voltage line (AC or DC, it doesn&#x27;t really matter) that goes to an outlet that has its own self-contained switching power supply and a bunch of low-voltage DC outlets.<p>Transitioning to this sort of system would actually be simple, you&#x27;d just have to make DC power supply boxes that plug into a regular 110 or 220 AC outlet -- sort of like multi-port USB power adapters, but designed for more power and probably higher voltages: perhaps +&#x2F;- 12 volts and ground.<p>A more sophisticated system might be that the DC power supply can supply a different voltage&#x2F;current to each port, and it negotiates with the device to supply to current power.  (I think this is basically how DC fast chargers for EVs work -- the car tells the charger what it can accept, and the charger supplies that the car.)<p>Maybe &quot;dumb&quot; devices that don&#x27;t know how to do the handshake just default to 5v DC or something.

No negotiation, no bullshit, no GaN, just 2 wires. Equipment, cabling, power strips would be dirt cheap.

            Most lamps do not contain a single LED, but rather a string of LEDs. For example, LED panels (troffers) usually use strings of 12 LEDs for a Vf of around 36V.

            That is because that package internally steps down that voltage. Any LED that produces light in the visible range will have a bandgap in the 1 to 2 Volt range. Feeding it a higher voltage than that would lead to disastrous current run away. The package that contains the LED and the current limiter and whatever other electronics are in there might of course accept 24V DV, or 110V AC or 230V AC or 17.4V at 4kHz. But the question that your parent comment was asking is: For which of those choices is the conversion most efficient to get to the voltage and current that the LED actually needs in the end.

            LEDs are usually current-controlled, not voltage controlled.<p>You might have several LEDs in series and they might very well have a voltage drop across all of them of 24V or even much higher when maintaining an operational amount of current.

            I know. But at the maximum rated current the voltage drop across the LED is going to be only marginally higher than the band gap. Definitely not 24 Volts. So the question becomes what do you do with the excess voltage. If you are smart you don&#x27;t just burn it in a resistor. And at that point the question is exactly what the OP asked: For which input voltage do you minimize total losses.

Or had to stuff your charging phone and battery into a jacket, crumple the whole thing and stuff it into a TSA bin. Or children bite your cables. Or dogs. Or the phone was in the car with a suction cup holder and fell off ramming its USB-C cable into some hard part of the car floor. THIS is daily consumer life.<p>If one hasn&#x27;t experienced the above, they probably sit in an office all day and work out in a gym and are oblivious to the realities of active lifestyles and how they are highly incompatible with physically weak connectors like USB-C.

            To me it seems that those use cases would require a massive and rugged connector like the computer mains plug. Realistically I suppose the solution is to have some sort of a bag. For me when hiking or biking I always charge my phone in the backpack&#x2F;saddlebag&#x2F;front bike pouch. For the laptop on knees it might be preferable to have a plug on the back (usb-c charging has the advantage that it can have multiple options, at least right&#x2F;left side. Another option is angled cables mostly immune to slamming from the side and somewhat resilient to angular momentum due to small size.<p>For chewed cables I agree. But again to actually make a resilient cable it would need to be thicker than most modern phones, the connector is not the weak point here.

            I mean, 1&#x2F;8&quot; headphone jack connectors were super strong, they were about the same size as USB-C and much, much more rugged.<p>Also you could easily miniaturize an IEC power cable, it&#x27;s the material and design that makes it good, not the size.

            Here come the excuses. No, I don&#x27;t. My phone battery dies quickly because I use it. It&#x27;s on 100% brightness (because you can&#x27;t see the screen with any less than 100% in the California sun) providing GPS navigation when I&#x27;m on bike rides, sometimes recording timelapses and videos for part of it (sounds like what phones were made for, right?). Then I get to some destination and I need to have a Google Meet call with video on. Maybe hang out in a park and code for a while using phone as a 5G hotspot for my laptop and constant VPN into my office. All these are pretty normal use cases to me, the 1 full day battery life is bullshit if you actually use your phone. Then battery is dead, on the way home USB-C cable between my pocket and the phone mounted at the front. Then sometimes I dismount the bike on short notice and USB-C cable yanks and gets deformed, sometimes even damaging the USB-C port. Really shitty design. Their designers probably never bike.<p>They should look at Zojirushi water boiler magnetic plugs. You can yank them all you want and they don&#x27;t deform. They&#x27;re designed to be yanked off accidentally by children without bringing down a pot of boiling water from the counter. They just need to miniaturize the concept.

            Almost every type of DC-DC conversion requires some intermediate AC conversion anyway.<p>And surprise, a lot of DC-DC topologies require a transformer too.<p>Transformers still soundly beat solid state conversion on cost, and efficiency at above the wall outlet voltages.<p>You can&#x27;t run away from that entirely. If you were to give a free hand to a good EE to redesign the electric grid from scratch, I doubt the result will differ much from what the world has already.

            But that intermediate AC is square (not sinusoidal) which means the transistors spend almost no time in the linear range, which means they generate very little heat. And the frequency is much higher than 60Hz too. It&#x27;s a very different kind of AC, with much more controllable and more efficient electronics.<p>Transformers still have their place but they&#x27;re still basically big dumb (uncontrollable) chunks of copper and iron.

            &gt; which means they generate very little heat<p>This is incredibly important to note. Buck-boost converters enjoy efficiencies beyond 90% in even the most pedestrian implementations. This makes their efficiency directly competitive with transformer-based designs (95-99%).

            &gt; Last but not least, low-voltage DC grids (up to 24V) are considered safe from shock or fire hazard<p>This is absolutely untrue. You may be safer from shocks, but it&#x27;s a much _worse_ fire hazard. The currents need to be higher at lower voltages. Higher voltages need less current for the same power, decreasing the fire risk.

            Seems like distributing power at low voltages, whether DC or AC will result in lower efficiency so it seems like using low voltage DC for higher efficiency distribution is a bit of a wash. It’s likely AC conversion efficiency will increase over time anyway.

            This doesn’t make any sense. Power transmission with DC still requires high voltage for any reasonable efficiency.  Then you have to convert it back down to a residential voltage (still probably &gt;100V for conductor material efficiency) and then devices have to convert that down to low voltage. So you’re not actually saving any conversion steps. On top of that, you have to use DC-DC power electronics, which are much more expensive than transformers etc. at high power levels.<p>There is an argument for using DC over AC but avoiding conversion losses is not a compelling part of it.

I just bought a reel of 30 high power mosfets from digikey for ~$450. Each of these bad boys can rock ~1kW continuous switched output&#x2F;input. Magnetics for the HV boost section of a 30KW DC-DC converter circuit are a mild additional cost.<p>Compare this to how much money you would have to spend for a more traditional copper &amp; iron monstrosity of similar rating (well over $1000).<p>Weight is also a huge factor when you start talking about megawatts.
