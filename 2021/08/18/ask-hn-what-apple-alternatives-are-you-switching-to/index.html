            For those studying MacBook alternatives, I think the most underrated “serious” notebook computer in the world is the Panasonic Letsnote SX&#x2F;SV.<p>Matte screen that actually works outdoors, removable long-life battery, unassuming vintage design (“let’s not rob that guy, he can’t even afford a new computer”). I haven’t investigated the Linuxability of this thing yet, but it’s super-light and impressive as a mosh terminal (especially with built-in 4G LTE!). Tough magnesium body, super comfy keyboard that’s easy to swap out if you beat it up. Made in Japan!<p>I have a fully loaded MacBook Pro, and couldn’t imagine doing design work on anything else, but I somehow end up getting lots of work done on the Letsnote. It’s at a point where I don’t think I’ll be excited about the long-awaited new 14-inch MacBook Pro, as I doubt it’ll have a matte screen and a durable exterior (and, I much prefer to look like a sad worker stuck with a dorky computer from 2006, than a moneyed tech guy).

            Looks like a japan only model. I should have known by the name, Let&#x27;s _____ is a really common Japanese product trope. You should try &quot;Let&#x27;s Corn!&quot; sometime. Its uhhh, japanese.<p>How do you suggest getting one of these things or getting support for it? I&#x27;m not against foreign market hardware but they can be a real pain in the ass for many. Last japanese laptop I had was almost 20 years ago, an ultraportable Sony. It was interesting but finding drivers online back then was a challenge.

            Let&#x27;s note sold in Japan only offers Japanese keyboard layout, this may be a top problem.<p>It seems that US keyboard model is sold as &quot;Asia Model&quot;, but sold only for corporate. Hopefully you can find used one. Possibly it&#x27;s also available in asian marketplace. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biz.panasonic.com&#x2F;jp-ja&#x2F;products-services&#x2F;letsnote&#x2F;lineup&#x2F;sv8-asia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biz.panasonic.com&#x2F;jp-ja&#x2F;products-services&#x2F;letsnote&#x2F;l...</a>

            Can you even get one of those Panasonic laptops outside of Japan?<p>Checked Amazon.co.jp and doesn&#x27;t seem like they ship to Europe.

            It’s pretty much a staple item in Corporate Japan, which probably explains why Panasonic hasn’t offshored production as everyone else did.<p>I think it’d be great to see more overseas business pick up for these computers — it’s one of those classic bits of Japanese technology that looks hopelessly outdated until you use it, and then you hope it never changes. My label for such things is “In-N-Out Burger Technology,” for reasons that should be obvious to my fellow Californians...

            Their trackpad is bad for me because they stick with circler form on most models. It&#x27;s bad just because very small. It support scrolling by tracing circle edge, but not much worth.<p>Meanwhile they also stick with old fashioned non-isolated keyboard. It&#x27;s great.

            You can probably buy a laptop with a certain generic form-factor with a rugged case that snaps onto the body. Panasonic, unfortunately, can&#x27;t get economies of scale like LG, Lenovo, Apple.

            This will probally be my next laptop.<p>I like the retro look.  I had a Panasonic years ago and adored it.  It was huge, but did everything, even had a tv tuner.  And it was easy to work on.  Used it 10 plus years.

            Desktop - Ubuntu 20.04. Everything works and my requirements are quite advanced - bunch of games on Steam, pro level audio production studio just to mention a few things.<p>Laptop - Dell Precision 7750, Xeon CPU, 64 GB RAM, bought with Ubuntu pre-installed. Beast of a laptop, superior thermals, wipes the floor with a mac.<p>Phone - Google Pixel. I consider that a lesser evil choice to Apple&#x27;s walled garden. It&#x27;s rooted, I don&#x27;t see any ads, etc.<p>Tablet - Google Pixel Slate.

            Yeah, so don&#x27;t upload your pictures to google photo. The main take away here is find an alternate backup cloud spot or host your own. Apple is forcing spying software on their phones on the customer to use your very own device to spy. Unless you&#x27;re simply trying to avoid false positives as a reason, most people are complaining about apple turning their device into a government 4th amendment free zone.

            I have the 7550 (15 inch version of the 7750), also with 20.04 on it (Dell shipped it with 18.04 though) and am also very happy with it, so +1 there.<p>I also have an Android tablet and Android phone running LineageOS without Google Play Services, and piggy-back off the SO&#x27;s Google Maps when we&#x27;re going places. F-Droid is fantastic here and, where needed, proprietary apps (Slack, Discord etc) can be installed via Aurora with various limited functionality (e.g. no notifications from either of those apps).

            Dell Precision 7xxx line is easily the most advanced laptop with official linux support there is. Every person who bought it after I recommended this laptop was impressed. I&#x27;ve got Ubuntu 20.04 on mine and the only thing that doesn&#x27;t work (yet) is the power button fingerprint reader which is a non-issue.

            As a counterpoint there are a number of things I don&#x27;t like:<p>* I can only have Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs<p>* They&#x27;ve removed all but one external indicator light (there used to be four), and its behavior is completely useless (there&#x27;s no way for me to tell externally what the power state of my machine is)<p>* They&#x27;ve killed the trackpoint<p>* This is the second of this series I&#x27;ve owned where neither of the fingerprint reader options are Linux compatible (no warning at purchase)<p>* The keyboard layout has regressed substantially - no more media keys, home and end keys are now fn-modified in the F row, page-up and page-down are also fn-modified where they used to be dedicated physical keys<p>* The e-port dock is gone in favor of a USB-attached version that occupies both USB-C ports on the chassis (and only provides two on the dock)<p>When I first received it my initial impulse was &quot;if I wanted this level of regression per generation I&#x27;d still be buying Apple&quot;, but I&#x27;ve learned to live with it, embodying the grouchy sysadmin stereotype even further (in a hyperbolic way), much to the delight of my coworkers.<p>P.S.

            Well, some of those points are down to personal preference. I for instance always hated the trackpoint thing and I am fine with the new clean and simple keyboard approach.<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on Apple.

            ThinkPad E series owner here. I find the default specifications worthwhile (including the keyboard). Dell was a contender but they priced the &quot;business line&quot; more expensive than ThinkPad. I got a sweet deal on Amazon and bought it in a heartbeat!

            I did consider Thinkpad at the time too, but they did not have an option to select linux OS when buying, so I went with Dell, because they don&#x27;t just pretend to support linux, they officially do.

            I don&#x27;t use ProTools, I use Bitwig Studio which is a full blown DAW with native linux support. There&#x27;s also Ardour and Reaper, so linux has plenty of DAWs to choose from. Also as I have mentioned in another comment - all VSTs that I need work just fine with wine&#x2F;yabridge.<p>I don&#x27;t use Adobe&#x27;s stuff either, but I know other people run Photoshop on wine, I just don&#x27;t know what issues they&#x27;re facing.

            I use Bitwig Studio. It has that polished feel of Jetbrains products and has very good MIDI production tools among other things. Of course the downside it&#x27;s not free and rather expensive, but it&#x27;s linux native. All the VSTs that I need work through wine&#x2F;yabridge flawlessly - Ample Guitars, Pianoteq. Even the crappy Kontakt works, but I don&#x27;t use it much. Backend audio server is JACK2 with Pulseaudio sink.<p>Ardour is probably most popular DAW on linux and it&#x27;s OSS&#x2F;free, but I found Bitwig better for my use, mainly due to MIDI functionality.

            I don’t care anymore. Actually I do, but I’m exhausted.<p>However if I buy a new laptop, with or without CSAM, it won’t be a Mac. I would wish for a Framework kinda thing here (with local service), but since that’s not gonna happen - ASUS it would be most probably, with ElementaryOS on it (or some distro like that - non ugly and kinda simple looking).<p>It feels like WhatsApp —&gt; Signal brouhaha all over again. After trying to get my contacts on Signal for 7-8 months and having deleted WhatsApp I’m back to it after my own struggles with Signal.<p>So no, not again. My next phone (if my iPhone 7 dies on me) will be an iPhone 12 Mini (or a 13 variant that’s around same size and cost) probably. Because that’s the only new phone that still bloody fits in my palm. After that? I’ll see.

            Thinkpads have served me pretty well, mostly for Linux though I do dual boot. A bit pricey new, but lots of options in the used market since businesses buy new ones all the time. Lenovo has had some controversy, but never with the Thinkpad line afaik and frankly at this point it’s hard to find a manufacturer without some history of controversy.

            Another challenge is the track record of some of the chinese phone maker competitors that ship for example without google play services is not long or its not good.<p>My instinct. This is an insane amount of noise on HN. But of all the privacy issues folks have, CSAM scanning by Apple is not going to &quot;destory apple&#x27;s brand&quot; and for most users the safety features (kids accounts flag up on nude photos etc) is actually what people want and we will see others following a lot of these moves.

            It&#x27;s not going to destroy the brand, it only put a dent into the privacy rhetoric.
There is no chance in hell that apple will stop with their privacy marketing over this and once enough time has passed people will start to think that they&#x27;re the only torchbearers wrt privacy again.<p>Their interest in privacy was never real, but their marketing is top notch as always...

            A couple of weeks ago I needed to do some very simple PDF &quot;editing&quot;:  I had 2 PDFs (A and B) and I needed to get some pages 2 (of 5) from PDF-A and 2 (of 5) pages of PDF-B into a single PDF. I tried to do that on Linux Mint and it was a nightmare: Download PDFSam,  create PDF from PDF-A with 2 pages, create PDF from PDF-B with 2 pages and then merge those 2 PDFs.<p>The way I achieve that in my Mac is by opening both file in preview, select and drag the pages I want from PDF-A to PDF-B and then select and delete the pages I don&#x27;t want from PDF-B.<p>Why do these simple things have to be so cumbersome in Linux in 2021?

            This seems like an over-reaction.

            For me, it was well thought-out. Apple betrayed my trust as  a consumer and the response in the past week was plain gaslighting. I thought about it for a couple of days and then decided that I don&#x27;t want to support a company like that anymore.<p>(edit)I was planning to buy a new MBP&#x2F;iPhone&#x2F;Watch in Q4, so this made it easier to decide on those purchases earlier.(&#x2F;edit)<p>It&#x27;s correct that the CSAM scanning is currently only effective when iCloud is enabled - and for US customers only.
For me, this detail is irrelevant. The backdoor might be inactive for now, but there would still be a backdoor on my phone.

            &gt; The backdoor might be inactive for now, but there would still be a backdoor on my phone<p>The key (from Apple&#x27;s POV) is that this <i>is</i> done on your device, so the model can be audited, and users will know if it changes or is suddenly enabled where it wasn&#x27;t before.

            Even if we were to call this a &quot;backdoor&quot;, it&#x27;s a backdoor that creaks quite loudly. I mean, what&#x27;s the attack vector here? The plan, as far as I&#x27;m aware, is to upload a list of hashes to each device that have been vetted by multiple child protection agencies. In order to surveil other things, additional hashes would need to be transferred that wouldn&#x27;t be vetted by these agencies. That would be noticed, and that&#x27;s the point where I would consider my trust to be betrayed.

            &gt; If hashes are uploaded to devices, they can be extracted and images that clash against it can be created.<p>Many organizations have the hashes, so they could leak nonetheless. Either way, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a major problem. If the system interprets a picture of a pineapple as CSAM, you only need to produce the picture of a pineapple to defend yourself against any accusations. If clashes are too commonplace, the entire system would become unreliable and would have to be scrapped.<p>In any case, I have looked it up. The database is indeed on the device, but it&#x27;s encrypted:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;CSAM_Detection_Techni...</a><p>&gt; Instead of scanning images in the cloud, the system performs on-device matching using a database of known CSAM image hashes provided by NCMEC and other child-safety organizations. Apple further transforms this database into an unreadable set of hashes, which is securely stored on users’ devices.<p>Overall, after reading the PDF, here is my understanding of the process:<p>1. Apple gathers a set of &quot;bad hashes&quot;<p>2. They upload to each device a map from a hashed bad hash to an encrypted bad hash<p>3. The device runs an algorithm that determines whether there are matches with hashed bad hashes<p>4. For each match, the device uploads a payload encrypted using a secret on-device key, and a second payload that contains a &quot;share&quot; of the secret key, encrypted using the neural hash and encrypted bad hash.<p>5. The device also periodically uploads fake shares with dummy data to obfuscate the number of matches that actually occurred. Apple can&#x27;t tell fake shares from real ones unless they have enough real shares.<p>6. Once Apple has enough real shares, they can figure out the secret key and know which hashes caused a match.<p>The main concern I have, and as a non-expert, is step 2: it requires Apple to provide their key to an auditor who can cross-check with child protection agencies that everything checks out and no suspect hashes are included in the payload. In theory, that needs to be done every time a new on-device database is uploaded, but if it <i>is</i> done, or if child protection agencies are given the secret so that they can check it themselves, I think this is a fairly solid system (notwithstanding the specifics of the encryption scheme which I don&#x27;t have the competence to evaluate).<p>The thresholding is also a reassuring aspect of the system, because (if it works as stated) the device can guarantee that Apple can&#x27;t see anything at all until a certain number of images match, not even the count of matching images. The threshold could only be changed with an OS update.<p>There&#x27;s certainly a lot of things to discuss and criticize about their system, but it&#x27;s going to be difficult to do so if nearly no one even bothers reading about how it works. It&#x27;s frustrating.

            I mean, that&#x27;s one imaginary scenario. On the other hand, it&#x27;s quite likely that upon a match the offending picture in full res is stored in an enclave on your device, and&#x2F;or encrypted in the cloud, in such a way that it cannot be deleted by the user.<p>If they know this attack is possible, Apple, not being idiots, will cover their asses in court by saying that a match is merely strong evidence that the user <i>may</i> have had CSAM on their account, but that it cannot be said for certain unless the full image is obtained by the authorities, and that the full image should be where they say it is, with the voucher made by the device.<p>Because of that, prosecutors are unlikely to want to move forward without better evidence: Apple may very well testify for the defence if they do, and judges will ultimately chew them out. So yeah, I suppose rashness and incompetence in some parties may lead to a very uncomfortable situation, but ultimately it is likely that the police would be reprimanded for it and that it would be a lot more cautious afterwards.

            They have access to a &quot;visual derivative&quot; (which I suppose is their way of saying &quot;thumbnail&quot;) but it probably wouldn&#x27;t help if the adversarial example is normal porn. This being said, once the authorities are contacted, they will have to work to obtain the full image, because if all they have is a thumbnail and a voucher, the evidence would probably be thrown out in court.<p>As for using it for other things than CSAM, well, for one, Apple would know, because the thumbnails would show political memes, so they&#x27;d have to be in on the conspiracy. They probably don&#x27;t want that liability. Furthermore, the hashes are supposed to be auditable: a third party could check that they are what they are, a court order could order such an audit, and it would be suspicious for Apple to refuse. They wouldn&#x27;t want to include anything that could piss off any sufficiently powerful government or, say, the EU, because they are likely to figure it out. And if they give different hashes to different citizens, that will also be obvious.

            You’re fooling yourself if you don’t think the government has a dozen other ways to backdoor you. Heck they basically just have packet scanners sitting on the networks of all the major telecoms, and almost certainly have compromised SSL root signing keys so they can trivially decrypt your traffic. Anything that goes over the network is fair game.<p>Love it or not, we live in a police state enforced by surveillance. Most Americans are just waking up to this because they’re not a member of a population actively oppressed by the police. Socialist &#x2F; anarchist &#x2F; labor communities that are more than shitposting groups meet almost exclusively in-person because their communications have long been targeted by law enforcement.

            Again, this has always been the case in the US. Newspapers were owned by wealthy businesses with a message to spread, as were the radio stations, then it was the big 3 TV networks for a long time, now it’s the 5 big tech companies. The gatekeeping is a feature, not a bug.<p>If you look to other societies, this happens there too. There is a symbiotic relationship between mass media and government at a fundamental level. There’s a reason that the first things you do after a coup are to lock down the Internet and sieze the TV &#x2F; radio broadcast infrastructure.

            Except in these cases, it&#x27;s not the government asking these companies to take down the &quot;misinformation&quot; videos. In fact, some of these companies try to add &quot;misleading&quot; label to actual, official government announcements.. Trying to run a parallel, unelected government.

            Which, again, has always been the case. It’s a very new phenomenon where an individual can deliver speech directly to thousands of people. The media were the gatekeepers of information and influencers of mass opinion, and they would frequently run stories with counterfactual information that suited their purposes.<p>Companies have always tried to run parallel, unelected governments. Whether it’s “company towns,” banana republics, or social media restrictions doesn’t matter.<p>No, I think the root of the problem is that the ability to disseminate information widely across a population is not a good thing. I do think there should be real regulation on <i>mass</i> speech that is proportional to the audience size. If you have 100k followers on Instagram, that should come with some responsibilities.

            &gt; I&#x27;m highly opposed to Apple&#x27;s CSAM move but they are still much better and transparent than Google, Amazon, and most other services.<p>Is this actually true? Is there a way to see what information Apple has on you? I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the full extent of what they have, but for example I can see(and hear) past voice prompts I&#x27;ve given to Google Assistant and their results.

            Yes, but I would argue the &#x27;rage&#x27; is justified (even if I don&#x27;t agree with the actions folks are taking). It&#x27;s opening the door, not matter how noble the effort or intention.<p>It doesn&#x27;t compel me to drop Apple. I still think they are the best of the best, but I agree in sentiment to many people here that it was a huge drop in my trust.<p>The lesson for me is that I cannot trust any company, and that is probably a smart approach. I will depend on myself and right now Apple, amongst all the players, is still the one that manages my privacy better than anywhere else. But I&#x27;ll be watching.

            To be honest... None.<p>It&#x27;s a choice. You might wholly disagree, but recent events aren&#x27;t enough to get me to switch yet, because I think the competition has too many tradeoffs.<p>I can get my photos scanned against a CSAM database... or I can have Google tracking my location constantly regardless of what they say (as they&#x27;ve been proven to be misleading in the past)... or I can use a Linux phone and say goodbye to battery life and useful apps I need. I&#x27;ll pick CSAM Scanning over my Location data being in the hands of Google, sorry.<p>And as for my laptop, macOS doesn&#x27;t scan, and the M1 is too impressive and has me spoiled.

            I think it&#x27;s less about privacy and more about what the invading actor will&#x2F;can actually do. People are less concerned about the Chinese government&#x27;s reach vs. the NSA or other three letter agencies in the US. I suppose if you are important enough to the Chinese government whatever they have on you could be used as blackmail, but most &#x27;regular&#x27; people don&#x27;t fall into that category.

            Thats moving the goalposts a bit though. The question wasnt in the context of those that go to, travel through or deal with Chinese government on the regular.<p>But rather in the context of those in America that largely only deal with American government officials and those outcomes.<p>And to my knowledge. China isnt abducting people or conduction renditions on american soil.

            As I said, I am not such a person. Most of the English-speaking world consists of the same.<p>As I said - I agree that China&#x27;s government is worse. In fact my previous employer had a policy that company devices just didn&#x27;t cross that border, even when traveling for work. But it&#x27;s still not a factor in which devices I purchase myself.

            He is right. US has complete power over people on their soil and basically in Europe and Asia as well. They do a LOT of extraditions of other countries citizens when they go traveling or to business trips from their citizenship countries.<p>China, on the other hand, does not seem to give a single f* about foreigners, only about their own citizens. Most people are not so are not really endangered even if chinese spyers do know what they handle on their phones. So in battle between US spyers&#x2F;China spyers I&#x27;d better give my data to Chinese, if I don&#x27;t have a choice not to share my data at all.<p>China, as well, don&#x27;t try to make extraterritorial laws (like financial regulations), so it&#x27;s harder to even be targeted by CCP if your are a foreigner.

            GDPR specifically excludes law enforcement so it doesn’t apply here.  The sad thing is Apple was legally required to allow law enforcement to search iCloud backups before they implemented this system, so nothing fundamentally changed.<p>However, after this backlash you can bet other manufacturers will continue to hide what their actually doing.

            I think Apple was actually designing this system internally as an improvement in terms of privacy.  Doing Perceptual hashing on the phones is more open and thus auditable than doing the same thing on their servers.  They set things up to require multiple different images to match etc.<p>However, the perception was very different.

            This kind of technology should not be on phone. Industry standard is doing it on the cloud. It requires only little code changes (let&#x27;s say in the time frame of 5 years) that law enforcement or whoever says: Please extend that to offline photos and then it&#x27;s only a few code changes to make that happen. I don&#x27;t want a ticking time bomb and Apple pinky finger promises that this will not be abused in future.

            That would be... literally all phones available today, wouldn&#x27;t it?  With the possible exception of the $2000 Librem 5 USA.<p>However, as one who&#x27;s moved from an iPhone to a Nokia 8110 with KaiOS, which I in no way argue is as secure as iOS:<p>It has less on it.  It has <i>far</i> less on it.  It has my phone calls, a handful of text messages, and while it has email access right now, I&#x27;m experimenting with if I actually need that, or can remove it (leaning towards removing it).  And my calendar.<p>The camera is horrible, so I just carry a pocket digital camera with me now if I care to take photos, which don&#x27;t end up on the phone.<p>If I don&#x27;t give it wifi privileges (which it currently has, but I&#x27;ve been running with wifi off and cell data off to see how that works, and the answer so far is &quot;quite well&quot;), there&#x27;s simply not much it can really do to my accounts or network.

            The Pinephone seems good as far as being mostly open, cheap, physical switches but... I guess the modem is not open. Anyway have I personally tested that the switches actually work&#x2F;no soft switch somewhere no... I&#x27;m mostly after the potential emerging market (apps) over privacy.<p>I have a KDE edition Pinephone that I intend to use more overtime but primarily an Android user.<p>Also I get super annoyed when Android bundles stuff on your phone. I realize you can get rid of it&#x2F;the cheap phone has to get paid somehow... but like having notifications that you can&#x27;t slide away... things like that. Want more control over I realize Linux phones are lacking in software, pretty bad... Plasma looked really nice, Phosh not so nice (home screen) but it works out of the box though particularly detecting external screens. Anyway I&#x27;m looking forward to it improving over time, a cheap Samsung Dex-like experience is my desire.

            Exactly, I think people are just getting a little too worked up over this whole thing. Apple computes a hash of each image you upload to iCloud then check it against a list of CP hashes.<p>Of all the things in the world to get worked up over, this is ridiculous.<p>I get it, the mechanism they&#x27;re using has apparent flaws, and maybe some whacko could somehow get access to your phone and start uploading things that trick the algorithm into thinking you have CP.<p>But, that alone is such a ridiculous phobia, if someone has that level of access to your phone, they could upload real CP and maybe even upload it to your Facebook for good measure.

            This is obviously sarcasm but I&#x27;d preface it with an explanation since HN is multicultural and not not everyone here is brought up to catch it effortlessly.<p>Edit: The point here is that even if Apple tries very hard to make this be only about photos about to be uploaded to the cloud, if the percentage of phones that turns off iCloud storage increases as a response to this new &quot;snitch-on-me&quot; feature that will be a very good argument for law enforcement to ask for a list of IMEIs that are not using iCloud, and it will also tempt them to demand that Apple start scanning all files.

            As skinkestek kindly pointed out, the point of my sarcastic comment was that now that the precedent of scanning the contents of users’ devices - as opposed to the contents of Apple’s servers - has been set, deciding whether to do so based on the state of a single “Store photos in iCloud?” toggle is going to start looking awfully arbitrary.

            If the goal was to make iCloud e2e, why not release both features at the same time so people can see that they&#x27;re codependent (in Apple&#x27;s eyes)?

This measure is only necessary for implementing E2E in iCloud insofar as it allows the feds to do the very thing I want E2E to prevent them from doing in the first place.<p>It’s as if USPS invented a new type of envelope that is physically impossible to open for anyone whose name is not written on the outside of it. Just one caveat: before they’ll give you any of these envelopes, you must allow them to read the letters being put inside.<p>If your concern is someone intercepting your mail before it gets to its intended recipient, this is great news.  If your threat model involves federal agencies reading your mail, you’re no better off than you would be without these fancy new envelopes.

            Apple could scan on the cloud. Rumor is that Apple wants to use E2E on iCloud, and this is a necessary step to shut up the government&#x27;s biggest critique of E2E and deploy it before the government can figure out a different excuse. We&#x27;ll see if that pans out.

            Your line is the maybe pennies of electricity over the lifetime of the phone? Weird. I can totally understand your line being the CSAM scanning itself but you seem to be fine with the exact same scanning being done with even more opaqueness and less transparency because it&#x27;s done server side.<p>I also get the slippery slope thing since you don&#x27;t really have any control over what your device does but that&#x27;s been true since forever. Running some scan() method and posting matches to a URL is something that literally could have been done in the last 10 years. It&#x27;s not like this tech is magically enabling something that wasn&#x27;t possible before.<p>And I do get the using your resources argument but iPhones have had integrated DRM since forever.<p>The thing I don&#x27;t get is why <i>now</i>?

            &gt; This is the first step towards that reality.<p>You know, I could respect your opinion that this is where you draw the line, but you ignore all of Apple&#x27;s history if you think this is the first step.

            Maybe consider that CP is just the excuse for the backdoor.<p>So apart from every Apple user being treated like a proven-until-innocent owner of CP, at all times, this will (yes, a matter of time) be used for political purposes, to find and silence activists, journalists, to discredit opposition leaders, to prosecute Uyugur&#x2F;Muslims&#x2F;women&#x2F;palestinians etc.<p>Do we really believe that CP owners store their collections in iCloud &#x2F; google cloud &#x2F; Dropbox and view them on their phones?

            If Apple were going to lie about this process, they didn&#x27;t need to announce it and go into so much detail at all. They could have just kept it quiet the way the current server side CSAM scanning is done by others already. The legal and market impacts of Apple lying would be severe.

            I haven&#x27;t seen a single person concerned about Apple scanning photos in iCloud. The problem is entirely that the scan is happening on your personal phone with apparently some janky implementation that in one week has already shown to have serious flaws.

            Going back to your original point, what makes you think checking for CP in images uploaded to iCloud is more private or secure when Apple&#x27;s servers analyse the entire image, rather than having the client generate a hash of the image and having Apple&#x27;s servers analyse that instead?<p>I work in data engineering and I can tell you what I&#x27;d rather do. Having Apple&#x27;s servers check hashes rather than the entire image means you can segregate the original images from the CP-checker data processing pipelines. That&#x27;s a much simpler and more secure security scenario.

            &gt; I get it, the mechanism they&#x27;re using has apparent flaws, and maybe some whacko could somehow get access to your phone and start uploading things that trick the algorithm into thinking you have CP.<p>Whatsapp by default adds all received images into Photos.

            The actual problem is not CSAM scanning.<p>The actual problem is that they&#x27;ve created a great surveillance tool which will inevitably get broader capabilities and they are normalising client-side data scanning (we need to eradicate terrorism, now we need to eradicate human trafficking, and now we need to eradicate tax evasion, oh, we forgot about gay russians, hmm, what about Winnie memes?).

            But this was already true. There is no reason the governments couldn&#x27;t have required this tool to be built at anytime all along. Remember EARN IT where Senators said figure something out (like this CSAM tool) or they&#x27;ll do it for Apple? The EU is similar, with upcoming draft legislation saying they have to do it if they don&#x27;t figure something (like this) out.

            Which is why CSAM is possibly a really interesting compromise&#x2F;counter-argument. Supposedly, the only actual crime that the FBI has repeatedly sent warrants to Apple about have been child pornography&#x2F;trafficking and it&#x27;s an interesting stance for Apple to take here: &quot;we&#x27;ll address the actual and specific crime you seem most interested in, but will still not give you a generic backdoor&quot;.<p>Many of the arguments&#x2F;fears about CSAM is that it can be widened to be a generic backdoor, but as you point out in the arguments Apple has already argued in court Apple doesn&#x27;t seem to think a generic backdoor is a good idea and have strongly fought against it and CSAM seems to be entirely designed to not be capable as backdoor, and especially not a generic backdoor.<p>I absolutely understand the fears of false positives and whatever processes the FBI and other TLAs choose to do with the results from CSAM (though many of those concerns apply to everything the TLAs do regardless of what technical tools they have at their disposal), but I&#x27;m not sure that I understand all the fears that CSAM is a generic backdoor (in the making) given what Apple have revealed about how it is built and what Apple&#x27;s quite explicit reasons seem to be to build it to entirely avoid building a generic backdoor and that everything about it seems a &quot;thumb your nose at the FBI by doing what they ask explicitly for but not what they really want to build&quot; by entirely building something that can&#x27;t be used as a generic backdoor and is very specifically built to only a tiny explicit use case the FBI has asked for.

            Also, all of the &quot;situations&quot; where this could be abused are already applicable on all other platforms. There&#x27;s no reason your Ex couldn&#x27;t upload CSAM to your Google Photos account, or to your Facebook account. Google Photos and predecessors have scanned since, what, 2013?, and would detect it, and would report it to law enforcement.<p>Despite this having been a possibility for almost a decade... there&#x27;s a suspicious lack of headlines of this attack occurring.

            This kinda of sounds like &quot;let them put a camera in my living room, I&#x27;m not doing anything wrong&quot;.<p>The biggest complaint here is clearly this is not where it&#x27;ll end, and it&#x27;s not a unique hash, so there will be false positives. And since it&#x27;s publicly announced, this is very unlikely to catch any producers of CP, and would only catch the dumbest consumers.

            &gt;Apple computes a hash of each image you upload to iCloud then check it against a list of CP hashes.<p>I don&#x27;t think it computes a hash of the image, it&#x27;s a tad more involved than that.<p>Simple hashing is easily evaded. They must be computing an identifier from the contents of the images in the CSAM database. This requires computational analysis on the handset or computer. If that&#x27;s all that were happening that would be no problem, but of course there are management interfaces to the classifer&#x2F;analyzer, catalog, backend, &amp;c<p>The contents of the identifiers are purposefully opaque to prevent spoofing of the identifier database. I don&#x27;t know what is included in the images; what if I take a picture at Disneyland with a trafficked person in the frame? Will that make it into the qualifier database? What is added to the CSAM signature database and why? What is the pipeline of hashesfrom NCMEC and other child-safety organizations-&gt;Apple&#x27;s CSAM image classifer alarm?<p>&gt;I get it, the mechanism they&#x27;re using has apparent flaws, and maybe some whacko could somehow get access to your phone and start uploading things that trick the algorithm into thinking you have CP.<p>The CSAM analyzer could be subverted in any number of ways. I question how the CSAM identifiers are monitored for QA (I actually <i>shudder</i> thinking there are already humans doing this :(  how unpleasant.) and the potential for harmful adversaries to repurpose this tool for other means. One contrived counterfactual: Locating pictures of Jamal Kashoggi in people&#x27;s computer systems by 0-day malware. Another: Locating images of Edward Snowden. A more easily conceived notion: Locating amber alert subjects in people&#x27;s phones, geofenced or not.<p>To my eyes, it appears we will soon have increased analysis challenges. Self analysis of device activity and functions for image scanning malware (for example) is slightly harder, we have added a blessed one with unknown characteristics running on the systems. Does this pose a challenge to system profiling? How&#x2F;does this interact with battery management? Is only iCloud scanning, or is everything scanned and then only checked before being sent to iCloud? (this appears to be the case[X])<p>There should be user notification too. If some sicko sends me something crazy somehow, I would surely want to know so I can call the cops!!<p>All in all this makes me feel bad. There is not a lot of silver lining from my perspective. While the epidemic of unconscionable child abuse continues, I question the effectiveness of this approach.<p>I would not consider jailbreaking my iPhone but for this kind of stuff. I would like to install network and permissions monitoring software on my iPhone such as Bouncer[0], Little Snitch[1], although these are helpfully not available for iOS.<p>I feel grateful that I am unlikely to be affected by this image scanning software, I&#x27;m planning to continue my personal policy of never storing any pictures of any people whatsoever. I don&#x27;t even store family photos this way. My Life is not units in a data warehouse.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.samruston.permission&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.samruston....</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.obdev.at&#x2F;products&#x2F;littlesnitch&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.obdev.at&#x2F;products&#x2F;littlesnitch&#x2F;index.html</a><p>[X] - Apple&#x27;s Whitepaper:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;child-safety&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;CSAM_Detection_Techni...</a>

            <i>&gt; I think people are just getting a little too worked up over this whole thing.</i><p>They aren&#x27;t, but the blame is misguided. This isn&#x27;t a problem with Apple. What is Apple going to do if they do detect something identified as CSAM on your device? Refuse to sell you another? Oh well. The real worry is what other parties will do if they get ahold of the information. That is what needs to be fixed. Apple is exposing the underlying problem, not causing the problem themselves.

            Apple have said what they&#x27;re going to do. If the number of hash hits reaches 30, then they&#x27;ll scale the image down and send it off to their manual review team. If they confirm it&#x27;s CP, then they call the police.

            Exactly. They&#x27;re not going do much of anything. It is what happens after the final step outlined that actually concerns people, and that is where the real problem lies. Apple is simply exposing the problem; or perhaps more accurately bringing the problem we all understand exists into the limelight. Had Apple not implemented this feature, or implemented it differently (scanning server-side, for example), the problem would still be there.

            I have no feelings towards the topic. I am merely summarizing what the consensus is writing on places like HN towards what Apple is doing.<p>The general sentiment does appear to be that the laws are misguided. That does not necessarily mean repeal is necessary. Augmentation may also provide a solution that satisfies their concerns. However, that is moving well beyond the topic at hand. There is no indication I can find that some kind of change is controversial. There is clear worry about the status quo based on the potential outcome of what information Apple may glean.<p>What remains is that Apple isn&#x27;t anyone&#x27;s real concern. An inanimate corporation can&#x27;t do much to you. Apple is simply bringing attention to what actually concerns people, which is something that was already there all along.

            As someone who had an Evo with custom FW back in the day, I can attest the process is much simpler in recent years. If you do your research and ensure the device you are purchasing has official lineage support, the entire setup procsss takes less than an hour. Lineage includes built in update support as well, although to upgrade between major versions you still need to use a computer if I remember correctly.<p>I purchased my first  iPhone since the 3G this year, and it is currently for sale on swappa. I am willing to compromise on a slightly less polished UI and subpar camera to get the UX of android back; at least for me, iOS was lacking many features I could consider essential.

            google doesn&#x27;t control for device screen sizes, software that other vendors load on, or the CPU&#x2F;ram&#x2F;storage on the phone, watch, or tablet. they also allow 3rd party app stores. this creates an experience that is out of google&#x27;s control and in a lot of cases is sub optimal for the user. it&#x27;s not as stream lined or polished as it could be.

            To each their own. I switched to an iPhone early this year after always having used Android before, and I won&#x27;t be buying another one. Apple nails the big picture stuff, but they have really dropped the ball on some of the details in their UX. Just a few arbitrary gripes off the top of my head:<p>* The Clock app doesn&#x27;t let you set a snooze length? Seriously?!<p>* Not having a notification LED or some other indicator really sucks. I might set my phone on the counter while I&#x27;m doing other things, and with Android, it was nice to be able to look up and see if I&#x27;ve gotten something without walking up to the phone and checking. (I know Apple will likely never implement this because it&#x27;s a great pitch for their watch.)<p>* Face ID is slow and inconsistent compared to a fingerprint reader (especially during COVID), and I&#x27;m bummed that Apple ditched the latter. It works well about 80% of the time, and the other 20% I&#x27;m that crazy-looking person that&#x27;s making faces at his phone trying to get it to unlock.<p>* If you had any sort of media app open previously and then connect some Bluetooth headphones, the media controls for that app open up and take up most of the lock screen, and there is no way to swipe them away; you have to kill the app to get them to disappear.<p>* I miss the inline notification controls. On Android, apps can give their notifications extra buttons, so you can do things like delete an email right from the notifications bar without having to open the app.<p>* My friend and I regularly send each other voice memos. First of all, the built-in voice memo feature in iMessage is atrocious (no seek and you have to restart from the beginning if you leave the screen), so we use the Voice Memos app to send each other audio files. Except, when you play an audio file inline through either iMessage or Mail, the screen will still turn off and lock, which pauses the file. You have to save it to Files, then open it via the Files app to ensure that it continues playing in the background. How are you supposed to know this?!<p>* If your iCloud storage is close to full, Apple will continually notify you every few days via your phone and email, and there is no way to disable these notifications.<p>* Needing a special charger sucks. Everything else I own is either USB-C or microUSB at this point, but my iPhone needs its own charging cable that nothing else uses.<p>* All of the special treatment that only Apple&#x27;s apps get is frustrating. For instance, why does only Apple&#x27;s Clock app get a special timer UX on the lock screen, and everyone else&#x27;s has to use a notification? Why does only Safari support ad blockers? And why is the camera button on the lock screen limited to the built-in Camera app? They really push their own apps with these artificial benefits, which detracts from the plethora of apps in the App Store.<p>* Syncing files (in both directions) without iCloud is a pain, and I&#x27;m not going to pay for an iCloud subscription. There are lots of different ways to achieve this, but none of them are as easy as simply using SyncThing on Android.<p>Even though Android is lacking in certain areas, I find the UX to be a lot more consistent than that of iOS, and I would take the consistency and flexibility of Android over all of Apple&#x27;s corner cases and attempts to predict how I will use my device. But again, that&#x27;s my personal preference, and to each their own.<p>(Sorry, this turned out to be much longer than I expected. I guess I&#x27;m more frustrated by iOS than I realized!)

            Google has been scanning photos for CSAM for... what, almost a decade now?<p>Also, as an iPhone user, contrary to the recent Hacker News fight, I actually view this CSAM scanning with a sign of hope, because this <i>hints</i> that we could get end-to-end encryption on iCloud Storage. The CSAM scanning is <i>rumored</i> to be just a prerequisite to get the government to shut up with their biggest critique of E2E, so that Apple can then turn it on.<p>If I can get E2E storage from iCloud but accept CSAM scanning on my device to satisfy the law... I&#x27;m OK with that choice. You might not, in which case, Android (and I&#x27;ll probably buy a backup Android phone &quot;just in case&quot;).

            Oh yes, I&#x27;m sure the FBI will be satisfied with using the backdoor to only find CSAM, they definitely will not use the access for &#x27;anti-terrorism&#x27; and drug enforcement. That sounds just like the FBI.<p>What good is E2E encryption when they can scan your client with a backdoor? All Apple is doing with this hashing is giving themselves plausible deniability when this access gets abused down the road. &quot;Oh we didn&#x27;t know they would use those hashes to arrest those protesters, we couldn&#x27;t have foreseen this&quot;

            E2E with some scanning at the onramp is still <i>much</i> better than no E2E. If iCloud was compromised, your data is still safe, among many other reasons.

            I don&#x27;t think they will. They already scan it all in the cloud, and the benefit of doing it on device is for user privacy, that&#x27;s not something google gives a shit about.

            Incorrect. It will use a generic model to warn children that they could be exposed to nudity, but that runs on-device and sends nothing to Apple. (It&#x27;s just a generic nudity detection model).<p>On iOS and iPadOS, they will implement the iCloud Photos CSAM scanning, but Apple left out macOS as having that for now. Rumoredly according to GitHub reverse-engineers of the system, it&#x27;s due to the mathematical precision of the NeuralHash algorithm being processor-dependent on ARM and not Intel.

            In that case, I&#x27;m not sure. The people reverse-engineering the algorithm say they aren&#x27;t quite sure if that&#x27;s because the system hasn&#x27;t shown up in MacOS Developer Previews yet (where it has in iOS and iPadOS), or if that&#x27;s because they are referring to the generic nudity detection instead of the database matching system.<p>For now, the security experts looking at this say that the nudity detection model is on all platforms, but the database matching in iCloud Photos is only on iOS and iPadOS and it&#x27;s unclear whether it will come to macOS.

            If you did all of the analysis on device, even quite cheaply, you could just transcribe key words and phrases into a text file and upload that. That would only be a few kilobytes of data tops per day of unique words and phrases, I should think. And if you&#x27;ve ever tried to monitor data usage on an Android phone, you&#x27;ll know that the monolith of Google Play Services phones home all the time with all kinds of pings and datapoints, so it wouldn&#x27;t be hard at all to upload that data.

            I think part of it is that Apple has always said &quot;what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone&quot;. People expect Microsoft to be evil, and (post &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot;) Google to be evil. Apple was supposed to be the good guys in this. So it&#x27;s more surprising and feels more like a betrayal when Apple decides to be evil.<p>Also, it&#x27;s actually pretty easy to mess with Android and get it un-googled. Google don&#x27;t make most Android phones, so there&#x27;s less hardware-level enforcement of rules, and more independent alternatives. This is less so for Apple devices. If Apple decides to do something you don&#x27;t like to your phone, you are SOL; you can only accept it or ditch Apple and switch to Android&#x2F;something else.

            &gt; Am I missing something more than &quot;but it&#x27;s happening on-device!&quot;?<p>People think that this kind of capability was not there already, while it was. The simplest example case is normal iCloud sync. It scans your files and gets metadata, finally comparing to cloud to know which files to sync.<p>Other concern is, that this can be easily expanded to other kind of content, or whole device (outside of iCloud files). While, this sounds like valid concern, government who can force this change, could have forced it already. &quot;Technology does not exist&quot; is not valid excuse, never was. There are pretty expensive consults used by politics to prove these excuses otherwise.

            Company can&#x27;t operate in the country, if they don&#x27;t follow country&#x27;s rules. Sad truth. They should have left the China in that case. 
On their defense, they have given only information which is stored by their system, not actively increasing the collection of it or creation of backdoors.

            When a pedo gets released from prison, in some jurisdictions they are required to have scanning software installed on their devices. Apple makes every customer a suspected pedo.
If you are comfortable with being treated this way, whatever floats your boat. Not everyone fancy receiving the same treatment as criminal on parole.

            There&#x27;s a reason why that&#x27;s 98%+ of the market. There is a dichotomy between the two camps in the smartphone market, everyone else is fringe.

            Maybe a violation of TOS, but I guess it&#x27;s one of these things that would not be enforced at all. Same way as Oracle can&#x27;t do much about Google using Java or Microsoft doesn&#x27;t do anything about Wine.<p>Regarding the second point - that&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ve heard there are some plans to add payments to the Aurora store&#x2F;F-Droid (which are alternative app stores) but right now you can&#x27;t use paid apps.<p>I consider this to be a plus though - gives me a chance to switch to open-source &#x2F; self-hosted apps.

            On laptop I moved to Qubes a few years ago, on a ThinkPad X1 carbon which is an amazing machine. I keep a c2014 MacBook around for miscellaneous things (e.g. syncing Spotify local songs to my phone over local WiFi, which I have not figured out how to do in the Linux client).<p>For phone I’m very interested in &#x2F;e&#x2F;os and the one phone you can get new with it preinstalled, the Teracube 2 (wired has a Teracube review of the very similar previous model).<p>I am looking at photoprism running on a home server (intel nuc) synced via PhotoSync (can sync photos via sftp). It actually looks really cool and uses tensorflow to do some sort of AI photo sorting locally.<p>By the way, while there’s a learning curve to this stuff, it feels very empowering and educational once you’ve put in the work. It feels like the future. Compute and storage is cheap. I think hosting things on your own server is the inevitable future. Once you’re set up it just hums along. This stuff will eventually be sold in appliance form (see Helm email server for the model).

            Phone: Google Pixel 5 plus CalyxOS at the moment. Probably will switch to pure LineageOS due to call recording support. The bootloader is locked so the phone is secure and does not call home. Highly recommend. Some apps and in-app purchases doesn&#x27;t work well on microG, also there are some issues with paid apps. And Android UX sucks but it&#x27;s a reasonable price to pay for privacy. In fact I&#x27;ve been suprised - with this phone I don&#x27;t feel as bad as I expected.<p>I really hope that Pixel 6 will have better camera and bigger screen and also would be supported by Lineage.<p>PC: I have an AMD desktop with Gentoo and going to buy Purism laptop later.<p>Watch: I don&#x27;t use them. Actually was going to buy next Apple Watch but...<p>Apple Pay: no good replacement, though contactless cards aren&#x27;t THAT bad.<p>Apple Carplay: phone+organic maps.

            What initially drove you to Calyx vs Lineage? I&#x27;m new to the Android fork landscape. I gravitate to &#x2F;e&#x2F;os because I like that it&#x27;s prepackaged, but have no qualms about rooting a phone myself if the OS is good. My main concern is privacy and with Lineage I didn&#x27;t trust myself to set it up properly - it seems as much oriented toward people wanting to just upgrade their Android phones or add features as people interested in privacy. So I worried about defaults. Calyx looks a little more explicitly pro privacy?

            &gt; What initially drove you to Calyx vs Lineage?<p>The promise of locked bootloader. Later I learned that Lineage does the same job, they sign their builds for AVB. Though their documentation sucks and forums full of idiots screaming &quot;NEVER LOCK YOUR BOOTLOADER&quot;.<p>Regarding &quot;privacy&quot; - I&#x27;m not really sure how much work is done in Calyx. Well, you may choose cloudflare dns out of the box and you have a &quot;firewall&quot; (just a better fronted to android permissions API). Though you can perfectly get that on Lineage. Lineage has its telemetry but you can switch it off.<p>Actually I&#x27;m thinking about building my own lineage-based distro (with proper call recorder built in), that&#x27;s not that hard. Though for now I don&#x27;t want to invest too much time into that.

            In pursuit of an acceptable phone, I&#x27;ve eyed the Fairphone with its laudable stance on repairability in the name of eco-friendliness as well.

The solution seems to be to buy eSolutions Fairphone with de-Googled Android.<p>I can live without free GPS navi but I&#x27;m wondering what to do about the few cases where you need a &quot;trusted&quot; device (a misnomer if there ever was one), such as banking push TANs or other mobile banking TFA apps, TOTP apps, vaccination pass apps or Covid contact tracing&#x2F;registration apps (I&#x27;ve managed to evade the latter kind of apps until now).

            For a free GPS navi, OSMand does the job. You&#x27;ll probably have to give up banking apps, while TOTP, by virtue of being a standard, has plenty of open-source implementations.<p>The contact tracing apps in europe interoperate, you can get the CCTG app from F-Droid and it works on AOSP (also includes vaccination pass storage).

You may be confusing it with another company with a similar name selling devices with GrapheneOS and various apps installed.  
Both are not associated with GrapheneOS, by the way.

            Around 6 hours of active usage and around 16 hours of idle time (exact values depend on what&#x27;s kept enabled and the signal strength of course). Currently it does not suspend to RAM at all, which is how PinePhone achieves longer idle times.

            It should be obvious that anyone who says “I’m concerned about privacy, so I’m going to switch to using Google products!” is not a serious person.<p>If you’re actually going to switch to using open source hardware phones and whatnot, then good luck I guess.

            LineageOS and GrapheneOS are as close as you can get to freedom and privacy on your phone while keeping lots of features. Open hardware + software phones are in the budding stage so people investing in them and using them right now are trail-blazers - not everybody wants to be one.<p>Therefore Android phones with custom ROMs are the way forward for privacy conscious people. It&#x27;s easy to mock if you aren&#x27;t serious about getting away from walled gardens.

            I’m testing how much I can move from services before switching devices and don’t have everything mapped out just yet.<p>- cloud backups: testing iMazing Wi-Fi daily backups to NAS. Tested a clean restore to an iPad that was perfect. The daily backups aren’t running consistently yet but likely has to do with power save settings.<p>- Photos: syncing with Synology Photos. Backup seems fine (40k of 65k pictures so far). The app leaves a lot to be desired vs Apple Photos.<p>Will test Calyx &#x2F; Graphene on a Pixel at some point but not likely to pass the wife test.

            I&#x27;ve been down this road long before CSAM, the gist is:<p>Use FOSS when possible, minimize all other internet-connected devices when FOSS is not available.<p>I actually still plan to continue using iPhone as a necessary evil until PinePhone, Librem, or similar are production ready (as my use cases demand). But I don&#x27;t trust the device, my world doesn&#x27;t revolve around the device, and that&#x27;s kind of the only way to live with having devices running proprietary, untrustworthy code.

There was a brief mention about fingerprint scanner in Linux, but I really appreciate that Thinkpads under something like Fedora just work out of the box.

            For those who want to keep using their Apple devices, I highly recommend Nextcloud as an iCloud Photos alternative.

            How large is your photo library &#x2F; how would you compare NextCloud photos to Apple Photos?

            None.  I am hoping that someone attacks me with a few dozen grayscale perceptual hash collisions so I can save them on my device, to iCloud, and hope it slips by Apple&#x27;s checkers.

            I used MacOS exclusively for 8 months before making my mind up. The initial plan was to use it for at least one year but after 8 months I was really fed up and went back to GNU&#x2F;Linux. I expected it to be better but in the end I found it was not, at least not for me. Although Apple invests a lot of money and effort in the MacOS user interface development I found it way too restrictive compared to any DE or window manager I used in past on GNU&#x2F;Linux. I am not Gnome nor KDE user but would pick any of these two over MacOS interface without second thoughts. Homebrew is useful and commendable but far worse than any of the major package managers on GNU&#x2F;Linux. Macvim was fine, but it did not have features I relied on in Gvim. I never used Safari because compared to Firefox the interface was clunky. I do not know about current Safari status but back then it didn&#x27;t have extensions. I wanted to switch many times over the 8 months and was relieved when I did. To me, personally, Apple products are overrated. MacOS? No. But thanks.

            I switched from my 2015 MBP to a System76 Darter Pro, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.

I now don&#x27;t trust either Google or Apple on privacy, for different reasons. As a practical matter, Apple is probably better for me, as I find it very unlikely that governments forcing Apple to do their bidding are going to be interested in me, personally.<p>I am relying on the Apple cloud, and I hate it. I have mp3 files for all my music, and I will soon stop relying on Apple for music completely. I take photos on my phone, and they go to the cloud. I think I&#x27;m stuck there, but again, I do have my own copies (via download to my wife&#x27;s Mac). Ideally, I could get photos from my phone to my Linux laptop directly, but I don&#x27;t know of a good way to do that.

            Is the CSAM an issue for macOS? That would be my only concern since I do not own an iPhone.<p>Honestly, as much as I go to extreme lengths to limit invasions of my privacy, short of going full Stallman, it would take a lot for me to chuck my M1 MacBook Air. I know people say they have a non-Apple laptop that is as good, but that has not been my experience. Every PC laptop I have owned has ended up being a pile of crap for one reason or another. Usually the hardware is flimsy, plastic gets warped and scratched, it gets slower over time, etc. I have never had such experiences with the Macbooks I have owned other than my keyboard giving out on my 2015 MBP a few months ago. This is coming from a former hardcore Linux user who used to look down on people with Macs.<p>(that said, I would love recommendations on comparable laptops for the day that may come where I ditch Apple)<p>I really hope that I can prevent or block CSAM on my current Macbook if it&#x27;s being adopted on macOS.

            In the same article, earlier in it, they say that the scanning is just iPadOS and iOS. macOS is just getting a generic nudity detection AI model for protecting children from new content that doesn&#x27;t require contacting Apple about anything.<p>&quot;Next, iOS and iPadOS will use new applications of cryptography to help limit the spread of CSAM online, while designing for user privacy.&quot;

            I&#x27;ve been lifelong Apple user (webdev, sysadmin, power user) up until 2018. I switched to dual-boot Fedora&#x2F;Xfce and Win10 on a Lenovo X1C 6th Gen.

            One thing I&#x27;d really like is to find a semi-dumbphone I can use Signal on and just get rid of having a smartphone with me. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to drop Apple completely and this morning I was wondering how far I could get with an Apple Watch and something like the Nokia 8110.<p>If anyone has suggestions for a small, minimal phone I can still run Signal on I&#x27;d love to hear it.

            I used to be a massive Apple fan, all hardware in our house was Apple. About 3 years ago we started switching away, and now only have an iPad Pro left.<p>desktop: custom PC running Ubuntu MATE 20<p>laptop: Thinkpad running Ubuntu MATE 20<p>Phone: Android Moto E<p>Streaming Device: Roku 3<p>Car: Android Auto<p>watch: no watch<p>tablet: Amazon Fire<p>I find it interesting that the Moto E is the cheapest smartphone you can get in America. Comcast gave it to me free with my plan. Yet it&#x27;s totally fine, meets all of my needs no problem. Only thing I did was add an SD card for more storage. Similarly with the Amazon Fire tablet, it was only $75 and easily meets all of my needs. Ignoring the privacy implications of Amazon&#x2F;Google ran Android devices, Android OS is impressive.

            been thinking about the same the last week+, and for phone I can&#x27;t help but want to go back to a Nokia feature phone. Email has been off my phone for a year and a half, no notifications. Trying to quit WhatsApp as well so not having it is a feature. The models available now aren&#x27;t quite there yet but I am hopeful. Really, my ideal would be:<p><pre><code>  - Good&#x2F;great camera, 8+ MP; Front facing optional. Dedicated shutter button&#x2F;quick access from sleep
  - GPS and HERE maps
  - Simple, native &quot;apps&quot; - Phone, Alarm, Calendar, Contacts, threaded SMS&#x2F;MMS, weather, podcasts, flashlight. Email optional
  - High quality screen (3&quot;, OLED, high PPI)
  - 4G connectivity, 5G optional
  - Tethering&#x2F;Hotspot capability
  - USB-C
  - Candybar form factor with number pad would work, but would prefer an E71&#x2F;72 reboot
</code></pre>
Thats basically it. Given how inexpensive something like the just released 6310 is (~50 EUR), it would be nice to have a &quot;high end&quot; feature phone around the 250 EUR&#x2F;$300 price point. Long battery a nice side benefit as well.

            Not yet switching but until last week I wanted to buy the next Watch (none yet), next iphone (now at X) and next ARM MacBook Pro. I decided to wait another year and first move all cloud stuff to some private hardware.

            Great discussion. I live in Apple&#x27;s ecosystem, and this is even more compelling with our new Honda Pilot basically being an extension of our iPhones. I have been on three road trips in the last 8 weeks, and this feature was so nice!<p>I am still considering stepping back, switching to a Pixel 5 from the CalyxOS organization, rely on my wife&#x27;s iPhone while on road trips, start using my GPU Linux laptop from System 76 as my main driver, and fall back on using ProtonMail with my email domain.<p>I did recently remove virtually everything from my iPhone except Freedom, text&#x2F;email, Chess, Go, Music, podcast, and Safari. I think my phone should just be a phone, more or less.<p>I am not so disappointed with Apple&#x27;s CSAM functionality as I am about their longer term trend. They are starting with something that has wide support, but who knows what is next.

            I&#x27;m 10 years early to this party but:<p>Desktop: Debian + i3wm is where I landed and stayed...<p>If anything were to change in future it would be Debian, but I&#x27;d be taking my setup with me (few dot files), which is a nice capability to have.<p>This is easier if you are a developer (not an iOS developer ofc), because most work on the CLI is just so much easier on Linux. I tried The BSDs at first, various Linux distros, and ultimately settled on Debian after using Ubuntu for a while. This is an opinionated area, and no distro is perfect, but I settled on Debian due to it&#x27;s ubiquity as a base for other distros and therefore familiarity and wealth of support and knowledge, but also because it&#x27;s the less opinionated base you can add whatever you want to... I also like their focus on openness.<p>My recommendation to anyone who _likes_, (or liked) Apple desktop and UI: don&#x27;t try to replace it or replicate it in Linux, you will be upset. Learn to love something else: control, and the permanence and stability it brings to your life. If you want a ready made full desktop environment they exist, KDE and GNOME, but in a way they are just another Apple, dictating and evolving how you do things with each update - It&#x27;s probably easier when you first switch, but you may eventually find yourself moving towards something simpler and less shiny... less is more, they are just window decorations at the end of the day, most of it is bloat.<p>If you do any kind of media, video, audio, raster, vector work... I wont lie and pretend this is a comparable alternative, you will need probably need either WINE or Windows, unless you know exactly what you need and know of a well supported program for Linux, e.g blender is supposed to be a pretty good contender for the proprietary 3D packages these days. While I like Linux, I agree Inkscape and Gimp are trash compared to Photoshop... i don&#x27;t even like adobe products but I&#x27;ve used both, and the former are an exercise in pain endurance - they are last resorts, don&#x27;t expect them to replace.

            I feel like I&#x27;m totally out of the loop on this. My understanding is that Apple scans for CSAM (as it legally is required to) when it uploads files to it&#x27;s cloud storage. What&#x27;s the problem and who exactly are  you expecting to provide cloud storage and <i>not</i> do this?

            GrapheneOS. Been using it since half a year and it exceeded my expectations by far. Maybe I was too pessimistic using an Android phone without Google play services but thanks to fdroid there are plenty of open alternatives for pretty much every app needed ... (At least in my case)

            Computer - Thinkpads with Linux or BSD flavours - enough to run web apps, and a capable SSH client.<p>Phone - Nokia 225 (dumbphone) - enough to call 911 or my partner&#x2F;mother&#x2F;pizza shop.<p>I&#x27;m keeping my iPhone SE, but it&#x27;s essentially going to stay in one or two rooms at home, only used for things that <i>need</i> a mobile device.<p>The key is adjusting your expectations.

            This is a pretty flimsy analogy because we&#x27;re not talking about criticism, we&#x27;re talking about taking pretty onerous, inconvenient steps to avoid having CSAM detected on your devices.

            Lying by omission isn&#x27;t a good choice, because you&#x27;re using a classic tactic of overstatement-by-framing that has been weaponized into standard police procedure to sway people into believing you.

            This thing is pretty well publicized, people do get it but not in the way you&#x27;re implying.<p>If you have children and you explain to the other parents that you&#x27;re just really passionate about privacy and are dumping all your iDevices for...<i>reasons</i>...your kids are probably not going to have friends come over to visit much after that.

            The last thing from Apple I had was a phone, I&#x27;ve switched to a Pinephone entirely.<p>That was a lot of work, I had to write my own power management service so I could get notifications during sleep without draining the battery excessively and there are still tons of bugs and little hacks I&#x27;ve written. If that scares you <i>please just switch to a trackphone because smartphone software authors will continue taking advantage of you after you switch to something else.</i>

            Desktop: I am currently on Windows 10. I have a lot of experience with Windows since Win 95, and more or less sure I can keep their invasive features in check via registry editing tools and also double check suspicious addresses on home router. Otherwise Windows is quite open OS without strict binaries signing rules.<p>I develop on PHP, Python, Kotlin and Go natively, using WSL for things like Ansible.<p>Phone: any recent Android with medium privacy settings on Google services. I allow location tags on Photos and location history on Maps, because it is quite useful. I tried to regulary change GAID, but untargeted ads became really awful, so I am keeping it for now.<p>Laptop: I don&#x27;t always use it, but when I do - it is Lenovo X1 Carbon with Windows 10.<p>Fitness bracelet: cheap monochrome Xiaomi (v3, I think).

            Linux has progressed a lot, but for productivity apps, it doesn’t come close to macOS.<p>What I want to see is a user-friendly productivity app suite as good as macOS for linux:<p>- Calendar
- Mail
- Preview<p>These apps need feature parity with the macOS, need to “just work” with sane defaults and need to be well thought out with an equivalent UX.<p>Don’t get me wrong, I ran Manjaro and Arch for a long time and I would love to go back to them as my daily workhorse, but the app support isnt nearly as good.<p>Even apps like Spotify bring my linux T480 thinkpad with 32GB ram to its knees because Spotify doesnt give a shit about Linux.
So as a result I have to find shitty second class apps that dont have full features, are buggy or dont work. Then I end up spending more time trying to get my computer to run apps properly than actually use it for its intended purpose.

            I don&#x27;t know enough yet whether to care about the CSAM issue, but I recently switched away from apple for a more ergonomic-but-portable setup where I can use a computer without wearing eyeglasses and save my neck from looking down without dealing with secondary keyboards, second monitors, etc.<p>This led to finding a combination of:<p>- An intel tablet - specifically HP makes one called the Elite X2 G4 (now G8) which has a 3k2k 13&quot; display. Running Ubuntu which isn&#x27;t perfect but tolerable - I keep a list of workflows replacements (primarily from mac to linux) here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;148zTJUwfVv9xfDcpSoH3mF-c4vqV3CqyEWXuqaAiXoA&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;148zTJUwfVv9xfDcpSoH3...</a><p>- A &#x27;tiny tower stand&#x27;, which allows one to prop the tablet close to the face. Other stands (e.g. roost) don&#x27;t enable this. It&#x27;s been sold out this year but hoping they come back.<p>- A nutype f1 keyboard (wired usb-c or wireless), and an apple trackpad (wired lightning or wireless). The combination still fits within the footprint of the tablet, eventually want to make a case for it for easy carry.<p>Again the motivation is finding something more ergonomic and portable enough to use at another desk. Do I recommend it? Depends on your intentions and time available. Mine are just around exploring ergonomics.

            It’s difficult to move away from Apple if you want to keep all your projects&#x2F;hobbies inside one computer. I can (barely) make Windows do all the things I need, but that’s not an improvement in any way. (Fwiw, aside from software dev I’m also a heavy user of audio software and AU&#x2F;vst plugins. Thousands I spent on software doesn’t translate to Linux).<p>And as I was typing this, my iPhone popped up a warning that the websites mandated by my kid’s school have all been compromised and offered assistance to update the passwords on there. Good job, Apple (and we’ll see how image scanning saga unfolds… I might just switch to OneDrive for photos, but it’s a question if it’s any better in that regard)

            With my phone I won’t accept any more updates, at least the ones I can resist, and I’ll switch to Android when there’s no other option. CSAM is a line crossed too far and I feel like Apple is telling me I’m just not holding it right again, and that makes me unhappy.

            Hard truth is Apple has really built its ecosystem brick by brick and is constantly getting stronger. And other companies don&#x27;t even seem like they have their eyes on the game wrt ecosystem. They do some parts better than Apple but no one seems to be focussing on the big picture. Once someone is fully in the ecosystem (phone, iPad, Mac, watch, Apple TV and some iCloud services) it&#x27;s really hard to find another ecosystem that works as well.. and that&#x27;s not a good thing for the industry in general

            WhatsApp works fine including its push notifications, you can download it from their website or via Aurora Store.<p>The AOSP Camera app is not as good as Google Camera but you can install it if you want. It requires Play services but you can install that too including in a dedicated user profile so other apps like WhatsApp don&#x27;t use it unnecessarily.

            I always saw Apple stuff as toys, so I own several ipads and boughta Mini 12 iphone because I was impressed with the size.
For computing, I use real computers running Windows 10 Pro or Linux (mostly Ubuntu) and I&#x27;m ready to leave Windows behind as soon as work no longer requires me to keep it.<p>Since that CSAM is not coming to Europe any time soon I guess I can ride that out and keep the iphones&#x2F;ipads and slowly have a look around if there&#x27;s an acceptable, dual sim phone that compares to the 12 Mini. Maybe my next phone will be a foldable...

            Linux is already, in my view, by far the best operating system! Complete freedom to do what you want, with high quality software.<p>So I continue to enjoy various wonderful Linux flavors!<p>I hope my iPhone deprecates faster than usual  so that I can soon ditch it for a de-googled phone!

            My understanding is Apple is not scanning photos on the device, but scanning photos uploaded to their servers: i.e. iCloud. I also understand this is the norm for most (all?) cloud-hosted file and photo storage platforms. I can opt-out having my photos uploaded to iCloud (which I do, but not for security concerns).<p>Am I misunderstanding anything?

            I&#x27;ve never had a MacBook but I feel the LG Gram line of notebooks is top-notch. I have a 17&quot; version and it&#x27;s light, fast, and has a long battery life. It has a full keyboard and is easily upgradeable. I run Arch Linux with GNOME desktop. All the hardware works on Linux except the fingerprint reader .

            I was looking at the lg gram 17 too but in the 2021 version they soldered both the ram slots and the wireless card, which is bad imho.<p>Like I cannot even find a version with 32gb of ram and if I buy the 16gb version I will never be able to upgrade it.

            To be honest, I don&#x27;t care that much.  Google, Facebook, Microsoft, they all do the same thing or worse.  I started using an iPhone because it had the best tech at the time and it was the most convenient.  The privacy stuff is nice to have, but it&#x27;s not a big deal to me.

            I never used any Apple products or services to begin with, so I won&#x27;t be changing anything. I&#x27;ve always disliked Apple and their locked-down, consumer-hostile, &quot;walled garden&quot; approach, so this is a big nothing-burger for me.

            Is it useful to add my vote to the very many &quot;none&quot; posts already in the thread? I have to admit I was annoyed by the implied assumption that&#x27;s in the wording of the title, which seems (to me) to imply that a sizable portion of HN is in the process of moving off Apple&#x27;s products because of the CSAM issue.<p>I tend to hope that everyone else sees every issue the exact same way that I do, and can word leading questions like the OP did here in the hope of somehow pulling everyone along as though (in this case) switching is the only reasonable choice and the question boils down to which platform to choose, rather than whether switching is a rational decision in itself.<p>Otherwise all the other posters giving good reasons why <i>not</i> to switch have done a much better job than I have in explaining why not.

            As of about a week and a half ago, I moved from a 2020 SE to a Nokia 8110 4G &quot;Bananaphone&quot; (the name totally fits) for my primary cellular device.  I still have the SE because I&#x27;ve not found replacements for a few key things yet, but it&#x27;s almost entirely shut off now.  Amusingly, AT&amp;T is shipping me a free Flip IV, because my Nokia isn&#x27;t listed on the &quot;We know it will work with the 3G networks turned down&quot; device list.  The tech support guy was quite amused, as was I, so I&#x27;ll have a legitimate flip phone here in a day or two as well as the bananaphone.<p>Perks of the bright yellow &quot;What on earth is that?&quot; - it opens up conversations about why I&#x27;m moving off Apple.<p>The lack of KaiOS Signal is a problem, though I&#x27;ve seen some work towards it - perhaps this will drive more development towards the not-Apple, not-Android ecosystems.<p>I considered a Pixel with GrapheneOS, but Google&#x27;s hardware reliability lately has left an awful lot to be desired, and I&#x27;m just tired of the smartphone concept anyway.<p>I&#x27;ve been playing casually with a PineBook Pro for the past year or so, and I&#x27;m getting that into duty to replace my MacBook Pro for in-house laptop use.  There&#x27;s a new firmware that makes the trackpad actually good, not the laggy, clunky, borderline usable thing that it shipped with, so that&#x27;s been nice.  I simply don&#x27;t use that much computing power in the evenings, and the PBP accomplishes most of what I want.  Unfortunately, again, it doesn&#x27;t have things like Signal as &quot;easy to install&quot; options (AArch64 is worse than ARMv7&#x2F;AArch32), so I should throw some time at that as well.<p>My office, which has a M1 Mac Mini I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of testing and work on, is going to suffer through going to a small ARM box as well - I&#x27;m going to put an ODroid N2+ in there, and see how it works.  I&#x27;ll have to drop back from the LG 5k to a 1440p display, as the ODroid can&#x27;t drive the 5k, but... eh, whatever.  Again, I just don&#x27;t use the computers for an awful lot.  I will lose some functionality with regards to video editing, but I simply don&#x27;t do much of it, and I do have an x86 Windows&#x2F;Linux PC in the house I can do that on if I need.<p>The one thing I&#x27;ve not found a great solution for yet is the iPad.  I use it for PDF reading, for web browsing, etc.  It&#x27;s <i>probably</i> safe to use in that style, if I strip accounts off, but... even then, I&#x27;d like to get rid of it if I can find an alternative.  That&#x27;s going to be a longer project.  I&#x27;m very interested in the PineNote announcement, as it would make a great PDF reader in theory, but see &quot;a lot of development to make it work.&quot;  They don&#x27;t even promise it will run the display when shipped...<p>As for paying for things, I&#x27;ve got contactless credit cards that can largely replace Apple Pay for &quot;wave something and go,&quot; I just have to separate them from the stack of cards first.  Not a big deal.<p>There&#x27;s a definite loss of function here, but I&#x27;m unwilling to state strongly that I&#x27;m opposed to all this, and then continue using Apple products as before.<p>And I&#x27;ve been looking to get away from the tech ecosystems for a while, so this is just a good kicker for me to do it.<p>I&#x27;ll probably keep the 2015 MacBook Pro as a &quot;I do still have some value to an Apple device, Apple having been part of my life for nearly 20 years now,&quot; but I&#x27;m going to strip stuff off and leave it mostly in archive mode.

            For anyone else who has experienced the frustration of trying to find a Linux replacement for the iPad, I highly recommend the Microsoft Surface.<p>I tried a variety of alternative tablets&#x2F;touchscreen options, until finally I bought a used Surface Pro 3 for ~$100 on eBay and installed PopOS. Over the last year, it&#x27;s been the best tablet I&#x27;ve ever owned (at least for my needs), including iPads.<p>There&#x27;s a whole subreddit dedicated to running Linux on Surfaces, if anyone is interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;SurfaceLinux&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;SurfaceLinux&#x2F;</a>

            How are you finding Manjaro for dev work? I set up Ubuntu 18 on a desktop build last year, it&#x27;s decent but it&#x27;s still finicky to be my daily driver, so I still use my MBP for work.<p>I think for a phone I may just drop back to a Nokia 3210 and buy a camera for family pictures. Whatsapp will be a loss, but hey, maybe it&#x27;ll be nice to not have my phone as a distraction during the day.

            Ironic, I just switched to the Apple iPhone ecosystem 2 years ago after a decade of using exclusively Android, to rid myself of Google and to get better made apps.<p>- Phone: There is no phones anymore that interest me from the Android ecosystem and iPhones satiate my desire to upgrade every year from getting updates and not turning to shit from use over time. Plus there isn&#x27;t much more I&#x27;d want other than a TouchID option besides FaceID. After moving my (big) whole family to iPhones, we iMessage and FaceTime a lot. I can&#x27;t re-teach my mother all over again to use something else.<p>- Watch: My first and only watch was a year ago. Android ones don&#x27;t interest me. Looking at the Amazfit GTR 2e and that looks good, but if I had to, I&#x27;d probably consider the PineTime watch cause it&#x27;s cheap and obviously not sucking my information or reliant on an app.<p>- Laptop: I had a MacBook Pro 15 2017 that I recently traded for a MacBook Air M1 that is working better in every way. I don&#x27;t use laptops much at all but I like it as an Apple dev environment when needed.<p>- Desktop: I have a custom built Ryzen+Radeon PC. I recently switched from Windows 10 when rumors about Windows 11 leaked. I currently use Ubuntu 20.04 (GNOME) at home and KDE Neon (Ubuntu 20.04) at work.<p>Linux Desktop Rant: But let me just say that Linux is a fucking disaster on the desktop still.<p>GNOME (GTK specifically) doesn&#x27;t have an icon&#x2F;thumbnail view mode when selecting files (GTK File Chooser Module) and they have refused to fix this. Every GTK base DE has this issue (GNOME, XFCE, Budgie, Cinnamon, Pantheon, LXDE Switching to a different unique DE like KDE doesn&#x27;t help much either cause apps BUNDLE GTK in them and force you to use the GTK File Chooser module<p>The most promising unique and usable distro (elementary OS) for the average user still has 3 major flaws: GTK based, Ubuntu dependent, and buggy releases. Elementary OS 6 still has a LightDM bug that makes it so that if you lock the screen or it goes to sleep, you can&#x27;t get back into your desktop session unless you force reboot.<p>The app ecosystem is splintering and some of the new options are just as bad or worse than regular package managers. I despise Canonical&#x27;s Snap stuff. Everything about Snap sucks to use. Makes apps 3x slower, spams my volumes list with loop devices, has flawed sandbox security, and apps can&#x27;t respect my OS&#x27;s theme so everything looks like shit.<p>I tried this weekend to get Arch (gave up due to complex issues) and Manjaro i3 (I also tried various other Ubuntu distros) setup on my work laptop this week only to have the issues with my installs. Kubuntu doesn&#x27;t allow me to encrypt my drive at installation. Arch and Manjaro fail to find my NVMe drive UUID at boot via GRUB EFI so it can&#x27;t even get to the decrypting LUKS which I have to do manually. And now I find out OpenWebStart doesn&#x27;t even support anything not Ubuntu&#x2F;Debian even for it&#x27;s compiling. IDK what else to use for launching JavaWeb applets. I ended up on KDE Neon cause it&#x27;s KDE and Ubuntu and allowed encrypting my drive at installation, so that works I guess but boy am I not happy with this compromise.<p>Oh and guess what, KDE Plasma doesn&#x27;t work well on Wayland. I already had it freeze and lock up on Wayland within just an hour of using it and now I&#x27;m running it on Xorg.<p>It&#x27;s all so tiring.

            Phone: Mobile router with rj11 jack, hotspot, and SMS web interface.<p>Computer: RasPi 4 8GB + 7” screen with Ubuntu Mate in a SmartiPi case.<p>Car: put the computer onto the visor and flip the display, hook up accessories.<p>I’m still with iPhone but pretty close to that setup. Mainly I am thinking about emergencies where I want my SIM in my phone when I leave my car. A second SIM that supports WiFi calling is likely the final step, giving the new # to the iPhone and using WiFi only when possible, at home or in car.<p>Sounds complicated, no doubt. Tethering CarPuter to iPhone is a much easier approach. I’m a VanLifer.

            I&#x27;ve never used Apple stuff, but my setup is this:<p>* Dell XPS 13 running Manjaro&#x2F;GNOME3. When this XPS dies, I will use the Framework laptop instead.<p>* Fairphone 3 running &#x2F;e&#x2F;OS (degoogled android) with Aurora Store and Aurora Droid.<p>* Withings Scanwatch, which doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of regular smartwatch functionality but does monitor my heart rate, provide ECGs and checks my blood oxygen saturation as well as pulse, steps etc.<p>* Contactless payments just through my bank card. Sometimes I try to remember cash is probably the safest and most ethical choice for payments, but I&#x27;m not good at this.

            It would be hard to leave Apple. I&#x27;m at least waiting to see how this shakes out, and I&#x27;m aware of the fact that the other major commercial vendors (Microsoft, Google) are far worse than Apple on most of these issues.<p>Linux is still too high-maintenance for me, though I could be convinced. I am watching <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frame.work&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frame.work&#x2F;</a> closely and considering grabbing one just to support that effort. The big flaw is use of Intel chips which are total shit compared to even Ryzens on power&#x2F;performance.<p>The M1 makes leaving Apple even harder. The performance is great and the power efficiency makes a laptop feel like it has some kind of zero point infinite energy device in it. You can do a full day&#x27;s work on an M1 running real apps like large builds, VMs, and IDEs and still have 1&#x2F;3 battery remaining, and it&#x27;s faster than a top-end Intel Mac.<p>There is absolutely nothing comparable to the M1 in the x64 PC ecosystem. A latest-generation Ryzen would be the closest you could get, but it&#x27;s hard to find good Ryzen notebooks due to Intel&#x27;s strong-arming of that space.

            In terms of power usage versus CPU performance, nothing beats M1 indeed. In terms of pure performance, Ryzen 7 5800X beats M1 in nearly every benchmark.
That&#x27;s ~200W versus ~20-30W though.<p>In terms of SSD performance, the M1 SSD upgrade from 256 GB to 1TB cost about 500 EUR, while a 1TB Samsung 980 SSD (with very similar performance) costs about 120 EUR <i>total</i>.

            Good lord. Why is everyone so upset by this CSAM scanning? Google scans every email you send, Facebook tracks every gesture and post you click. What makes you think that apple hasn&#x27;t been scanning, or at least had access to, all your stuff in the cloud anyways? The instant you trust your data with a third party, you forfeited your privacy. The whole CSAM thing isn&#x27;t a revelation.<p>If you&#x27;re upset by the thought of a third party entity looking at your stuff then stop using products by these companies. Use FOSS for your computer programs and OS&#x27;s. Use a phone OS like graphene, &#x2F;e&#x2F;, or something else privacy oriented.<p>The only way to stop being a commodity is by sacrificing convenience and the only way to gain that convenience back is to build your own tools. Talk to the old timers here that have been using minimal OS&#x27;s and building custom scripts for the past 20 years. They&#x27;ll tell you that you get a level of speed, efficiency and customizability you can&#x27;t get with name brand OS&#x27;s.<p>The learning curve is worth it considering you build knowledge and skills not a lot of people today have. Not to mention you gain technological independence, which is worth its weight in gold.
