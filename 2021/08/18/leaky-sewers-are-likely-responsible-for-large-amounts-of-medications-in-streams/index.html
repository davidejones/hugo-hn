            &gt; Shouldn&#x27;t we be placing the blame on people flushing meds down the toilet?<p>Obviously, people shouldn&#x27;t do that. But some antibiotics go through the body almost unchanged. When penicillin was first developed they used to recycle the antibiotic from the patient&#x27;s urine over and over because they had so little of it.

            Typically &gt; 90% of any drug taken orally is immediately discharged through the first pass metabolism (urine primarily, and breath and feces).*  The body is good at disposing of substances it isn&#x27;t looking for, especially when ingested.  There are a lot of scare stories about the result (male fish in the Great Lakes with ovaries; therapeutic levels of antidepressants in the Edinburgh water supply, etc) but this is the first article <i>I&#x27;ve</i> seen that talks about the path.<p>Because of this so-called &quot;first path&quot; effect you end up taking enough that hopefully <i>some</i> (and enough) &quot;gets to the required location&quot; and not too much gets where it&#x27;s not wanted (most of what counts as &quot;side effects&quot;).  The approval process focuses on this and ignores anything excreted, which shouldn&#x27;t be surprising: with few exceptions the process is #1 safety and #2 minimal clinically effective dosing.<p>* former pharmaceutical scientist; have designed protocols approved by the FDA.

            Uhhh, isn’t first pass metabolism a metabolic pathway, not an excretion one? In other words, it’s the liver taking a first crack at breaking things down enzymatically at anything absorbed before it gets distributed around to post-liver bloodstream?

            Out of curiosity, does this change at all if a person has a fatty liver or cirrhosis?  Asking because a very large number of people in first world countries are pre-diabetic or have metabolic syndrome sometimes referred to as syndrome-x.

            Exactly.  Excretion of a drug unchanged is actually pretty rare. Most drugs get metabolized to something else before excreted.

            &gt; Obviously, people shouldn&#x27;t do that.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is obvious or even particularly well-publicized.<p>The &quot;official recommendation&quot; in the U.S. for many meds is that they be flushed down the toilet, especially scheduled&#x2F;controlled substances.  The FDA maintains a &quot;flush list&quot; [1] of medications that you are specifically instructed to dispose of by flushing.  However, even for medications not on the official flush list, it&#x27;s common to be informed by reasonable authorities that you should dispose of them by flushing -- e.g. I had to sign paperwork at my doctor&#x27;s office affirming that I&#x27;d responsibly dispose of my unused ADHD meds by flushing them down the toilet before my dr would write the prescription.  This was seconded by the drug&#x2F;alcohol training I was given as a condition of attending college, which stated that you should flush <i>all</i> unused medication.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;drugs&#x2F;disposal-unused-medicines-what-you-should-know&#x2F;drug-disposal-fdas-flush-list-certain-medicines#FlushList" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;drugs&#x2F;disposal-unused-medicines-what-you...</a>

            If you didn&#x27;t pee it out it would remain in your system longer, limiting treatment options if it is in any way toxic.  Or, if you don&#x27;t pee it out it might over time break down into more toxic substances.

            So if I&#x27;m reading the article correctly:<p>1.  It doesn&#x27;t say anything about whether the medications <i>would have been</i> removed if they went through a wastewater treatment facility.<p>2.  It&#x27;s basically saying we accidentally performed a tracking experiment by adding compounds that don&#x27;t occur (in those levels) naturally to wastewater, and then seeing where we could find those chemicals unexpectedly -- it&#x27;s like dumping fluorescent dye down your drains to see if you can find it spotting in the yard, but with pharmaceuticals.

            In case you&#x27;re from the U.S. and wondering why you&#x27;ve never heard of this particular sweetener, I looked it up. It appears to be one of the ingredients in Equal, along with aspartame.

            For a private pool with a few users, sure, one person could skew the results with a diet coke big-gulp, but for a busy public pool with thousands of users, then I&#x27;d think that some assumptions about average intake would give reasonable results.

            If you&#x27;re only interested in measuring increase over time, then the only assumption you need to make is that average consumption of Ace-K remains constant over time. And, I suppose that people that consume Ace-K pee in pools at the same rate as other people. As someone who doesn&#x27;t pee in pools (but has peed in the ocean), I don&#x27;t know how valid that is.

            I&#x27;ve looked at countless sewer inspection videos--those pipes can be up to 80 years old and are often in pretty bad shape. Sewage leaking into the groundwater is a major problem but is very hard to detect and locate unfortunately.<p>Shameless plug: We&#x27;re a startup building AI to detect leakages in sewers and tell cities when to fix their underground pipes. If you want to help us solve this problem and make cities more sustainable, let me know at ew@hades.ai :)

            I’m not sure above-ground pipes makes a lot of sense. Now every building has to maintain a pump to get sewage high enough off the ground that vehicles can pass under the pipes. And if those pumps fail (e.g. power outage), all of a sudden everyone is dealing with sewage backflow.<p>Something I’d like to see more of is utility tunnels where all utilities are undergrounded in a single tunnel with with easy access. Yes it’s expensive, but could work out in the long run. Just look at how much utility relocation can drive up the cost for simple projects like BRT.

            You don&#x27;t necessarily even have to tunnel, like one would do with a borer. I think that would be cost-prohibitive.<p>Trench and cover, probably with streets.<p>But it would create a lot of extra void to maintain that would need its own drainage, maintenance to keep it free of debris and pests, inspections to make sure they don&#x27;t collapse, and security to keep people out. Feasibility is probably commensurate with urban density.

            There&#x27;s also the issue of where you would put all the spoils from tunneling. Historically that was in the ocean and rivers to make more land, but this is frowned upon for a variety of reasons now, the least being that not all types of soil work well as landfill.

            Not apples-to-apples, but having living in places with above-ground and below-ground power supply, I know which one I&#x27;ve found more reliable.<p>Yes, maintenance gets more expensive, but that maintenance should be far less frequent.

            Back in 1999 we had a massive storm in France. It put large parts of the country in a blackout in the middle of winter because all the electricity infrastructure was above ground. Out neighbours in Germany, who buried everything, were fine. We had water, as it was already underground. Nowadays everything is systematically buried.<p>I&#x27;ll take the odd risk of contamination and excavator-induced failure over fragile and inconsistent infrastructure every day.

            Most is kidney passthrough into pee. Second is combined sanitary AND rain runoff sewers - which bypass treatment when there is high rain. Third is treatment plant pass through - many drugs are not eliminated in sewage plants (it varies a lot with the drug)

            &gt; <i>Second is combined sanitary AND rain runoff sewers - which bypass treatment when there is high rain.</i><p>This is a very difficult problem.  If the sanitary sewers aren&#x27;t in great condition, rising ground water levels can leak into the sanitary sewers.  Sewers that were initially well made might be damaged over time by people digging, the ground shifting, or tree roots pushing things around.  One way or the other, when high ground waters get into a sanitary sewer, you now have a situation where those sewers are overflowing.   And what can be done with that overflow?  Let it pool up in the streets?  Sending it down the storm drains is about the best you can do at that point.

            I think the original comment is referencing cities that built early sewer systems where they do not have separate sanitary and stormwater lines. That is by far the more pressing problem: street drains (and often house gutters) dump directly into the same lines. These systems are usually in big cities and were built before sewage treatment existed. Building enough capacity to handle stormwater surges is often not practical: what was relatively clean rainwater is now contaminated with sewage.

            I&#x27;m not talking about combined sewers.   Systems in which the sanitary sewer and the storm sewer are completely separate can <i>become</i> combined sewers when the sanitary sewer is inundated with more infiltration&#x2F;inflow than it can handle.   When this happens, the sanitary sewer overflows into the street or people&#x27;s homes.   That sewage overflowing into the street will then make its way into the storm sewer.<p>There is no easy solution to this.   Building the sanitary sewers bigger is the obvious solution, except that costs more money and a lot of places don&#x27;t have much money to spare (corruption, poverty, etc.)  Furthermore, just how over-designed does a sanitary sewer have to be?  Climate change makes this difficult to predict decades in advance.<p>BTW [intentionally] combined sewers are problematic even when they&#x27;re not overflowing. Diluting sewage with a bunch of water increases the cost and decreases the efficacy of treatment.

            &gt; Diluting sewage with a bunch of water increases the cost and decreases the efficacy of treatment.<p>Combined sewers are definitely problematic, but if diluting costs more depends on the inputs to the treatment plant. Some plants need to dilute with fresh water, and storm sewers are freshish, so it might reduce costs to use storm water rather than potable water.<p>If all else is equal, in my mind, I&#x27;d run the storm sewer to the treatment plant and treat it when there&#x27;s capacity and let it flow when there isn&#x27;t. Of course, most of the seasonal difference in sewage flow is from groundwater infiltration, so that probably doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense... Both systems will be at higher flows at the same time, for the most part.

            Sure, assuming anyone has a desire to pump money into a large comparative study like this.<p>It&#x27;s an extremely reasonable hypothesis but you also have other factors to deal with (size of city resulting in more wear and tear on infrastructure, other environmental factors that could cause deterioration of pipes, water hard&#x2F;softness, quality of wastewater processing facilities).

            It is in the urine.  Drug companies have long resisted any investigation of the impact of their drugs once they have exited the first patient.  The necessary implication would be that waste from patients on certain drugs should be treated as hazardous, or even radioactive.  That&#x27;s Pandora&#x27;s box.<p>A parallel question is whether the body of a deceased patient should be treated as hazardous.  We do tend to bury or cremate them without a thought towards whether these drugs will survive and impact the local environment.

            Human waste gets heavily diluted, essentially immediately, and even more so once it leaves the waste treatment plant for the local river, lake, or ocean.<p>Cat shit stays intact when it goes to a landfill, and thus would cause a potential hot spot that humans would not.

            Many people in rural areas use composting toilets.  It&#x27;s a popular trend with those into self sustaining homesteads.  The poop is generally going to be handled by a family member and mixed in with compost.  After the bacteria in the compost breaks it down, it is then mixed in with other fertilizer and earth and used in greenhouses.  The products grown in the greenhouse may be shared with neighbors or sold locally.  Just adding for completely sake.

            I don&#x27;t think that there is a need for monitoring since radiotracer usually have a short halflife, they usually use fluoride-18 (half life 110min) to replace a -OH or a well placed -H in a molecule that bind to the site of interest (ex: glucose -&gt; fluorodeoxyglucose, levodopa -&gt; fluorodopa).

            &gt; Contrary to popular belief, birth control pills account for less than 1 percent of the estrogens found in the nation&#x27;s drinking water supplies<p>&gt; Some research cited in the report suggests that animal manure accounts for 90 percent of estrogens in the environment.

            There are two rather distinct questions:<p>1. How much estrogen gets into the water supply from birth control pills?<p>2. How much estrogen gets into the water supply from women&#x27;s urine?<p>(There are other similar questions, of course.)<p>These two questions are related in that #1 is mostly a subset of #2.

            It appears that article say the source being urine waste of women taking birth control pills is debunked, it says nothing about the long-term health impacts of drinking water being contaminated with estrogen or what the sources of the other 99% of estrogens found in drinking water are.  So while the causal link may be false, the underlying claim is still a concern.<p>It&#x27;s actually a massive problem in the West, especially the US, that the average person is exposed to tons of endocrine disruptors in the food and water supply, everything from estrogens in the water to plasticizers in your food wrappings on your take out or in the store.

            A bigger question in my mind is whether this is a real problem, or ever could be with higher concentrations likely to occur in this way. Certainly not having medications in the tap water seems safer than having any, but what amount of what specific chemicals is likely to have a downstream effect? This poses a much broader question about low dosage toxicity for any number of chemicals in fresh water, ranging from agricultural run-off to industrial waste and spillage. Hard to study.

            Natural flowing water (in streams, rivers) contains ions of calcium, magnesium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, potassium and fluor, with chlorine content around 10mg&#x2F;l.

            A quick google search suggests that a typical basic sewage treatment plant doesn&#x27;t do a great job of removing pharmaceuticals.  But we already do have some plants which are pretty good at it.  So this isn&#x27;t even really an engineering problem at this point, it&#x27;s a political(funding) problem.

            &gt; we should blame the drug makers?<p>No, of course not.<p>What I am saying is that our best shot at getting pharmaceuticals out of fresh water is better sewer &amp; water treatment.  We can control that.  It is implausible to control people who are, within the privacy of their bathroom, chucking random things down the toilet.  The only thing that would stop that behavior is immediate consequences to them personally.<p>Edit: And this assumes it is all people chucking drugs down the toilet.  If it&#x27;s coming through their urine, then we&#x27;re definitely back to water treatment being the only plausible answer.

            Part of the idea of wastewater treatment plants is to address things like chemicals in wastewater. If the pipes on the way leak the tainted water, it can&#x27;t be treated. Of course there are also &quot;forever chemicals&quot; that we can&#x27;t neutralize, but we have no hope of dealing with chemically tainted water that never gets to the locations capable of addressing it.

            The federal government doesn’t maintain sewer lines anywhere in the US except maybe on military bases and the like. At least in California we have special tax districts that are managed by a voter-elected board. The voters literally get to decide on infrastructure spending, at least in California.
