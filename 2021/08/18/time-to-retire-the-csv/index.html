            I don&#x27;t agree with giving up csvs until the following conditions are met:<p>1) A truly open format is available and accessible. Csvs are textfiles. There is no system around that cannot open a textfile. If the format is binary or requires patents or whatever, then it&#x27;s a non-starter.<p>2) Applications have a speed increase from using csvs. To wit, I loved csvs because often they finish preparing much faster than a &quot;formatted&quot; output in excel, etc. and sometimes I just want to see the numbers, not have everything colored or weird features like merged cells in excel, etc.<p>3) The new format should not be grossly larger than the one it is replacing. Extracts in Excel format are orders of a magnitude larger than csv in filesize. This affects run-time to prepare the extract, open it (memory constraints, etc.)<p>Is there truly a problem? The author is not forced to use csvs.

            You&#x27;re comparing CSVs to other spreadsheet document formats. But a CSV is not a spreadsheet. A CSV is raw data. (It&#x27;s data that is restricted to a shape that enables it to be easily <i>imported into</i> a spreadsheet—but data nevertheless.) As such, it should be compared to other <i>data</i> formats—e.g. YAML, JSON Lines, etc.<p>These other data formats all win on your #2 against CSV, as CSV is actually <i>horrible</i> at parse-time vs. other data formats — the fact that both of its separators (newlines and commas) can appear as-is inside column values, with a different meaning, if those column-values are quoted, means that there&#x27;s no way to parallelize CSV processing, because there&#x27;s no way to read-ahead and &quot;chunk&quot; a CSV purely lexically. You actually need to fully parse it (serially), and only then will you know where the row boundaries are. If you&#x27;ve ever dealt with trying to write ETL logic for datasets that exist as multi-GB CSV files, vs. as multi-GB any-other-data-format files, you&#x27;ll have experienced the pain.<p>&gt; The new format should not be grossly larger than the one it is replacing.<p>Self-describing formats like JSON Lines <i>are</i> big... but when you compress them, they go back to being small. General-purpose compressors like deflate&#x2F;LZMA&#x2F;etc. are <i>very good</i> at shearing away the duplication of self-describing rows.<p>As such, IMHO, the ideal format to replace &quot;.csv&quot; is &quot;.jsonl.gz&quot; (or, more conveniently, just &quot;.jsonl&quot; but with the expectation that backends will offer Transport-Encoding and your computer will use filesystem compression to store it — with this being almost the perfect use-case for both features.)<p>-----<p>There&#x27;s also Avro, which fails your point #1 (it&#x27;s a binary format) <i>but</i> that binary format is a lossless alternate encoding of what&#x27;s canonically a JSON document, <i>and</i> there are both simple CLI tools &#x2F; and small, free, high-quality libraries that can map back and forth between the &quot;raw&quot; JSON document and the Avro-encoded file. At any time, you can decode the Avro-encoded file to text, to examine&#x2F;modify it in a text editor.<p>The data-warehouse ecosystem already standardized on Avro as its data interchange format. And spreadsheets are just tiny data warehouses. So why not? ;)

            &quot;Self-describing formats like JSON Lines are big... but when you compress them, they go back to being small.&quot;<p>For CSV file replacements, I&#x27;d expect something like &quot;one JSON array per line, all values must be JSON scalars&quot;. In that case, it&#x27;s not much larger than a CSV, especially one using quotes already for string values.<p>But this demonstrates the problem with JSON for CSV, I suppose. Is each line an object? Is it wrapped in a top-level array or not? If it is objects, do the objects have to be one line? If it is an object, where do we put field order? The whole problem we&#x27;re trying to solve with CSV is that it&#x27;s not a format, it&#x27;s a family of formats, but without some authority coming in and declaring a specialized JSON format we end up with a family of JSON formats to replace CSV as well. I&#x27;d still say it&#x27;s a step up; at least the family of JSON formats is unambiguously parseable and the correct string values will pop out. But it&#x27;s less of a full solution than I&#x27;d like.<p>(It wouldn&#x27;t even have to be that <i>much</i> of an authority necessarily, but certainly more than &quot;The HN user named jerf declares it to be thus.&quot; Though I suppose if I registered &quot;csvjson.org&quot; or some obvious variant and put up a suitably professional-looking page that might just do the trick. I know of a few other &quot;standards&quot; that don&#x27;t seem to be much more than that. Technically, even JSON itself wasn&#x27;t much more than that for a lot of its run, though it is an IETF standard now.)

            That is not quite a CSV replacement. I use it for things with objects and stuff all the time. To be a CSV replacement you really need to add that each line <i>must</i> be a JSON array, and that it can only have scalars in it (no sub-arrays or objects). That would be a decent enough replacement for CSV itself. Not perfect, but the CSV &quot;standard&quot; is already a nightmare at the edge anyhow and honestly a lot of it can&#x27;t be fixed anyway, so, this is probably as good as it could get.

            They&#x27;re saying that a CSV equivalent should be strictly 2-dimensional, with &quot;flat&quot; values.<p>Such a format could contain arbitrary JSON in a &quot;cell&quot;, but simply as text, in the same way as putting the same data in a CSV.

It does me no real good if I have an XML schema and a corresponding file.

There are generic JSON and XML readers that allow you to parse the data elements sure, but so, too, do generic CSV readers like C#&#x27;s CsvHelper or Python&#x27;s csv. In all cases you have to know what the object turns into in the application before the serialized data is useful.<p>And, yes, CSV has slightly differing formats, but <i>so does JSON</i>. Date formats are conventionally ISO 8601, but <i>that&#x27;s not in the spec</i>. That&#x27;s why Microsoft got away with proprietary date formats in System.Text.Json. XML isn&#x27;t really any better.

            Sorry, that should be System.Runtime.Serialization.Json. System.Text.Json is the newer class that replaced it.<p>In .Net Framework 4.6 and earlier, the only built-in JSON serializer in the .Net Framework was System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer.<p>You can still see it. If you&#x27;re on Windows 10, run Windows Powershell v5.1 and run:<p><pre><code>  Get-Item C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe | Select-Object -Property Name, LastWriteTime | ConvertTo-Json
</code></pre>
You&#x27;ll see this output:<p><pre><code>  {
    &quot;Name&quot;:  &quot;notepad.exe&quot;,
    &quot;LastWriteTime&quot;:  &quot;\&#x2F;Date(1626957326200)\&#x2F;&quot;
  }
</code></pre>
Microsoft didn&#x27;t fix their weird JSON serialization until quite late. They may have back ported it to the .Net Framework, but they&#x27;ve deleted that documentation. Powershell v6 and v7 include the newer classes that are properly behaved. This is why Json.NET used to be so popular and ubiquitous for C# and ASP applications. It generated JSON like most web applications do, not the way Microsoft&#x27;s wonky class did. Indeed, I believe it may be what System.Text.Json is based on.

            Oh that one - yeah I&#x27;ve always steered clear of DataContractJsonSerializer. Never understood why they did it so weird.<p>To be fair, RFC 3339 wasn&#x27;t even published back when this class was implemented (in .NET 3.5) so I guess they just went with whatever worked for their needs. ¯\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯

            I have wondered about a file format where a parser could be specified for [at the start of] each line. You could even have different json parsers with different well-characterized limits and relative speeds. Formats could change over time on a line-by-line basis, without being locked into a full-file IDL or similar.

            &gt;the fact that both of its separators (newlines and commas) can appear as-is inside column values, with a different meaning, if those column-values are quoted, means that there&#x27;s no way to parallelize CSV processing, because there&#x27;s no way to read-ahead and &quot;chunk&quot; a CSV purely lexically<p>Yes, this is a major pain. It can be avoided by using Tab separated value (TSV) files, which don&#x27;t use escaping. But then you can&#x27;t store Tabs or carriage returns in your data. Also there is no way to store metadata in TSV.<p>JSON is far from ideal for storing 2D data tables as it is a tree. This means it is much more verbose than it needs to be. The same is also true for XML.

            Maybe. It is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem though. They aren&#x27;t likely to become popular until editors support them.<p>Also, the fact that they have been around for years and never taken off implies that they probably never will.

            More generally than editor support, how is the average person expected to <i>type</i> them? I could easily add them to my keyboard, but if &quot;editor support&quot; turned out to mean &quot;Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Record Separator Character&quot; and I was now bound only to editors that support this, absolutely nobody is going to bother. They specifically need to be trivially typable in exactly the way commas and newlines are.<p>Realistically I don&#x27;t think anyone (at least on HN) would presume that editor support would be so weirdly obtuse, but it&#x27;s not exactly well-defined here, either.<p>I&#x27;m mostly just thinking out loud, here, not really critiquing anyone.

            Actually, there is already a standard way for someone to type these with the control key.  To be specific, they are:<p><pre><code>  FS: ^\ GS: ^] RS: ^^ US: ^_
</code></pre>
Since these delimiters are not much used, on many terminals ^\ is mapped to send SIGQUIT.  Use &#x27;stty quit undef&#x27; and you can then type this at the keyboard.  This works on Linux and OS X, and likely most other systems.  Note that with most keyboards you are also using shift for RS and US. For emacs, prefix with C-q so that it inserts the literal.<p>Other posters have noted that they have ASCII separators recently, I have as recently as 2018 internally at a FAANG.  So they are not completely unknown in the wild.

            The other advantage not being discussed here is that once you have a csv parser, it can be trivially generalized to use any character as a delimiter, and you can <i>usually</i> find a character that isn&#x27;t found in the data you&#x27;re working with unless you&#x27;re working with binary data. I work on a legacy system where passing delimited files around is usually the integration method of the day, and if you can&#x27;t delimit with commas (common) then you just delimit with tabs. If you can&#x27;t delimit with tabs or commas, then delimit with pipes, which are rarely if ever used outside of code. Or use tildes, or grave accents, or...<p>Doing this avoids quoting, which avoids an entire class of problems. And yes, if you&#x27;re passing multi-megabyte files around on a regular basis, or transferring giant blobs of text or binary data, or looking for a storage format with metadata then csvs are an absolutely awful choice, but as with any problem you pick the right tool for the job, and csvs are a great tool when you want to easily move some structured alphanumeric data around in a format that&#x27;s trivial to parse in any language and widely supported.

            JSON&#x2F;JSONL is not self-describing for many of the most common tabular data use cases. There&#x27;s no date type or currency type.<p>If you are going to displace a standard, it has to be significantly better than the old.

            CSV does not have date or currency types. Those are an Excel conventional microformat overlaid on top of CSV.<p>The semantics of CSV — how it decodes, if you don&#x27;t have an application making additional <i>configured assumptions</i> or using <i>heuristics</i> to <i>detect</i> microformats — is just N columns, one of header names, N of raw text cells.

            You misunderstood my point. CSV, for all its faults (and I am intimately aware of them), is ubiquitous. You&#x27;re not going to replace a widespread standard with something that only offers a tiny incremental improvement. Ubiquitous <i>is</i> a feature, and generally trumps all other features.<p>If you want something better than CSV to take off, at the very least it needs to solve the common pain points of CSV.

            &gt; If you want something better than CSV to take off...JSON doesn&#x27;t...<p>Agreed. I don&#x27;t ever see something better than CSV taking off (having worked on this problem for better part of a decade) <i>unless</i> you could get to the point where you&#x27;ve got a largely similar notation, but a richer semantic grammar powered by something like Schema.org.<p>In other words, a strongly typed CSV with a community backed schema.

            At least in my experience, I don&#x27;t see a lot of trouble with number vs string in CSV data. You convert the string to a number or you don&#x27;t. The pain points are usually dates or currencies - the same problem I usually have with JSON, because there&#x27;s no standard format.<p>I think you could fix most of the pain of CSV simply by adding a second header row which defines the type of the column, using a common vocabulary of types. TEXT, NUMBER, ISO8861-DATE, etc.

            I envy your life of pristine CSVs and compatible implementations, where JSON doesn&#x27;t solve any problems. But CSVs have a broad range of uses, and there are, in fact, plenty of implementations that do not follow RFC 4180, and even if everything did there would still be issues like the header row being optional (without an in-band way of telling). JSON is, in practice, much more well-defined.<p>On text vs numbers, at least some widely-used software (e.g. R, Excel) will try to guess for you. It should be obvious how this might cause problems. Maybe one should turn auto-conversion off (or not use things that don&#x27;t let you turn it off) and specify which columns are numbers. Some datasets have <i>a lot</i> of columns, so this can be a PITA, even if you do know which ones should be numbers. But the bigger problem is if you have to deal with other people, or the files that they&#x27;ve touched. There are always going to be people that edit data in excel, don&#x27;t use the right options when they import, etc.

            JSON solves tons and tons of pain points around CSV... for implementing anything that reads&#x2F;imports&#x2F;<i>normalizes</i> CSV data. Just the fact that CSV has multiple standards around the quote&#x2F;escape&#x2F;separator&#x2F;NULL character-sequences, with the choice <i>not get encoded into the document</i>, means that any format that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have that problem is instantly 100x better in terms of not experiencing a disaster of data-garbling-on-import.

            The formats you describe sound interesting, but in the big corporate&#x2F;government world the barriers to adoption are high. For example, the software package Cognos which is owned by IBM and connects to database servers. To extract data from it, you have a choice of csv, Excel or pdf. The pdf is only used if you have done a perfect job creating a report in Cognos and don&#x27;t need to edit&#x2F;adjust it further in Excel. So really, only 2 output formats.<p>I realize that this is a specific use case here, but I was on Cognos for years, and then when they started shifting over to Tableau, it wasn&#x27;t any better.. csv, MS formats, proprietary formats, etc.

            The entire article is about replacing CSVs for exchanging data exported from Excel... so why wouldn&#x27;t he be picking data formats based on being able to load and edit them in Excel?  If you&#x27;re trying to solve this problem in a way that EXCLUDES Excel, you&#x27;re already doomed.  The business world will laugh at you and continue on their merry CSV way.<p>&gt;The biggest and most thorny problem to solve is the people problem: how do you convince people to stop creating new CSVs when they’ve never done things any other way? Fortunately - for this problem, anyway - most of the world’s business data is born in one of a handful of programs that are owned by an increasingly small number of companies. If Microsoft and Salesforce were somehow convinced to move away from CSV support in Excel and Tableau, a large portion of business users would move to a successor format as a matter of course. Of course, it’s debatable whether that kind of a change is in the best interest of those companies, but I’m cautiously optimistic.

            Yes. You could get a long way with a text format in which:<p>-the first line is always a header<p>-fields are separated by Unit separator characters<p>-records are separated by Record separator characters<p>-encoding is UTF8<p>If you wanted to get fancy you could also have:<p>-comment lines<p>-column metadata (e.g. column 0 is an ISO date, column 2 is text, column 3 is an integer)<p>Both the above could start with a Unicode character unlikely to be used for anything else.<p>I think that would avoid 99% of the pain of CSV files.

            The funny thing is you can type any character on a keyboard. It&#x27;s the same weird disconnect about &quot;text file formats are human-readable&quot;.

            &gt; The first clue on this might be that the Avro spec includes mappings that list how primitive Avro types are mapped to JSON types.<p>My understanding was always:<p>1. that the &quot;primitive Avro types&quot; are Avro&#x27;s <i>wire types</i>, which are separate from its representable <i>domain types</i>. (Sort of like how RLE-ified data has wire types of &quot;literal string&quot; and &quot;repeat literal N times&quot;.)<p>2. that any data that would not be valid as input to a JSON encoder, is not valid as input to an Avro encoder, because its wire types are defined <i>in terms of</i> their a mapping <i>from</i> a set of domain types that are exactly the set of domain types accepted by JSON encoders (whether they&#x27;re explicitly noted as being those or not.)<p>Or, to put that another way: an Avro schema is — besides a validation step that constrains your data into a slightly-more-normalized&#x2F;cleaned format — mostly a big fat <i>hint</i> for how to most-efficiently <i>pack</i> an (IMHO strictly JSONly-typed) value into a binary encoding. Differences between &quot;long&quot; and &quot;int&quot; on the wire aren&#x27;t meant to <i>decode</i> to different domain types (at least, by default); they&#x27;re just meant to restrict the data&#x27;s allowed values (like a SQL DOMAIN constraint) in ways that allow it to be more predictable, and so to be <i>wire-encoded</i> more optimally.<p>Let me lay out some evidence for that assertion:<p>• Avro supports specifying e.g. &quot;bytes&quot; vs. {&quot;array&quot;: &quot;byte&quot;} — there&#x27;s literally no <i>domain-type</i> difference in those! But one is a <i>wire-encoding optimization</i> over the other.<p>• Avro has a &quot;default&quot; property, and this property—as part of the JSON-typed schema—can only take on JSON-typed values. Do you think this is an implementation constraint, or a design choice?<p>• Avro&#x27;s enum type&#x27;s &quot;symbols&quot; array? Once again, defined by (and therefore limited to) JSON string values.<p>• Avro doesn&#x27;t implement an arbitrary-precision integer type, even though its wire-encoding for integers would support one just fine. Why? Seemingly only because JSON doesn&#x27;t have an arbitrary-precision integer type (because JavaScript doesn&#x27;t have a native BigNum type); nor does JavaScript&#x2F;JSON have any obvious type to O(1)-efficiently deserialize a BigNum out into. (Deserializing BigNums to strings wouldn&#x27;t be O(1).) Every other language offers a clean 1:1 mapping for bignums, but JavaScript doesn&#x27;t, so JSON didn&#x27;t, so Avro doesn&#x27;t.<p>• And why do you think Avro schemas are stored <i>as</i> embedded explicitly-defined-to-be-JSON documents within the root-level record &#x2F; .avsc file, anyway? This means that you are <i>required</i> to have a JSON decoder around (either at decode time, or at decoder codegen time) to decode Avro documents. Why would this be, if not because the Avro implementation is (ot at least originally was) expected to decode the Avro document&#x27;s wire types <i>into</i> the JSON library&#x27;s already-defined ADTs, relying on e.g. having those &quot;default&quot;-parameter values already loaded in in JSON-value format from the schema&#x27;s decode-output, ready to be dropped seamlessly into the resulting Avro decode-output?<p>And the biggest knock-down argument I&#x27;m aware of:<p>• Avro &quot;string&quot; doesn&#x27;t support &quot;\u0000&quot;. Why not? Because as you&#x27;ve said, Avro has a &quot;JSON encoding&quot;, which specifies one-to-one mapping for strings; and JSON <i>doesn&#x27;t support</i> &quot;\u0000&quot; in strings. (Just ask Postgres&#x27;s jsonb type about that.) Since an Avro string containing &quot;\u0000&quot; wouldn&#x27;t round-trip losslessly between the JSON and binary wire-encodings, it&#x27;s not allowed in strings <i>in the binary encoding</i>.

            Since it is a serialization format, Avro&#x27;s types are its wire types. However, the primitive types are just a subset of the types that Avro supports.<p>Based on these comments, my best guess is you got the idea that Avro was for encoding JSON because the schema declaration is encoded in JSON, but that&#x27;s not nearly the same as the data model. There are some terrible implementations of Avro libraries out there that use JSON as some kind of middleware, but that&#x27;s not how Avro actually works.<p>If there&#x27;s a type model it is derived from at all, it&#x27;s the Java type model.<p>&quot;byte&quot; is not a valid type in Avro. There is only &quot;bytes&quot;, and the domain model reflects this. You can&#x27;t work with individual &quot;byte&quot; of a &quot;bytes&quot; object.<p>Default values are encoded in the schema, and so that does limit what kind of default values you can have, but again this is a limitation derived from the <i>schema</i> being defined in JSON, and how the schema language was defined in general. So your defaults have to be represented as JSON literals, but they don&#x27;t even necessarily share the type of the JSON literal (e.g. a field defined as: &#x27;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;long&quot;, &quot;default&quot;:1}&#x27; does not have the same default value as &#x27;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;int&quot;, &quot;default&quot;:1}&quot;, because &quot;foo&quot; has a default value that is a long while &quot;bar&quot; has one that is an &quot;int&quot;). Note that &quot;default values&quot; are a property of the <i>type</i>, and only apply to elements inside complex data types. JSON has no such equivalent concept.<p>Avro&#x27;s type model does have an arbitrary precision type that doesn&#x27;t correlate to anything in JSON: the &quot;decimal&quot; logical type.<p>You aren&#x27;t required to use a JSON decoder to decode Avro documents, nor are you required to use a .avsc file. The Avro schema file is just the standard way to represent a schema. If you have the schema, you don&#x27;t need the file. JSON schema files are one of the poorer choices in the Avro design, but you&#x27;ll notice that the schema is defined the way it is specifically so that it can cover a type model well outside of JSON. You&#x27;ll also notice the names of types in Avro don&#x27;t directly correlate to names of types in JSON.<p>* The \u0000 thing is a bug in avro tools, but there is nothing about the spec that prohibits having \u0000 in your strings.<p>I feel like in general this is like a retcon exercise, where you&#x27;ve reached a conclusion and are drawing evidence to prove it, while ignoring the information that contradicts. I spoke with Cutting a fair bit when he came up with Avro, and I can assure you, while the schema language does very intentionally use JSON, Avro is not a representation for JSON types.

            As someone who&#x27;s used Avro [0], it&#x27;s a pain because Avro records <i>must</i> be ordered, but JSON by definition is unordered. Avro&#x27;s &quot;JSON&quot; format is more of a JSON-like format. At one point, when I was writing a script that would ingest an Avro record and then output a new one, I had to fiddle with things to make Python use an OrderedDict [1] so the new record would be output in the right order.<p>[0] though the last time I touched it was in 2014, so things might&#x27;ve changed since<p>[1] as per [0], this was before Python dicts were ordered by default

            I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by Avro records &quot;must&quot; be ordered. If you mean that the serialization format specifies the ordering of the fields, then yes, that is true, but that&#x27;s an advantage in terms of compactness and processing efficiency (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avro.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;spec.html#order" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avro.apache.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;spec.html#order</a>). If you don&#x27;t like it though, there are other formats like protobuf and thrift that have no such requirement, at the cost of ~3 bits per field, which can be a comparatively efficient trade off.

            It&#x27;s not possible to read ahead and chunk with 100% assurance it will always work, but libraries like pandas and R&#x27;s data.table do a reasonable job of reading in the first X rows, doing some usually correct type inference on the columns, and then read ahead and chunking the rest of the rows.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I totally agree something like compressed json lines is a better data exchange format, but part of why csv remains as universal and supported as it is is that so much existing data storage applications export to either csv or excel and that&#x27;s about it. So any ETL system that can&#x27;t strictly control the source of its input data has no choice but to support csv.

            &gt;  means that there&#x27;s no way to parallelize CSV processing, because there&#x27;s no way to read-ahead and &quot;chunk&quot; a CSV purely lexically.<p>There&#x27;s a subset of CSV that forbids escapes that is super fast to parse.

            Commas, quotes, colons, newlines, and hyphens (JSON and YAML separators) can occur in content as well. How is that any different from separators occurring in csvs?<p>In practice, I used TSVs a lot, as tabs do not usually occur in most data.

            If you interpret &quot;CSV&quot; as purely comma seperated values then maybe. But in my bubble &quot;CSV&quot; means textfiles that are separated by some separator.

            It seems quite common in some European countries to use semi-colons as the delimiter instead of commas (because they use commas as the decimal separator?), adding a new level of fun to parsing. In Easy Data Transform we count the number of commas, semi-colons, tabs in the file to make an educated guess as the delimiter (which the user can override).

If the underlying software outputs PTVs, you don&#x27;t want to bother converting that because you&#x27;re working in a legacy language that&#x27;s a pain to work with (the type where identifiers can&#x27;t be longer than 4 chars), and you want the user to be able to double-click on it and have it open in a spreadsheet without prior configuration, you just push the issue to the reader of the file, since by tradition readers are already quite tolerant of format differences...<p>Of course, there&#x27;ll always be the case where the reader is simply not tolerant enough, like when the escaping syntax differs.

            Technically true, but like I said &quot;CSV&quot; is more a term for human readable data, with some delimiter in them. Maybe it&#x27;s a comma, maybe not. In every case you need someonne to look at it. If you want a machine-machine data protocol you can use XML or JSON if it needs to be somewhat human readable.

            &gt;CSV is actually horrible at parse-time vs. other data formats<p>I find this really hard to believe given it&#x27;s a simple enough syntax. And parsing is usually not the limiting factor, usually fast enough to not be noticed alongside interpreting or loading the source data. Every (much more sophisticated) compiler I can think of uses a linear parser based on this assumption.

            CSV is far from perfect, but it&#x27;s nice that I can easily work with them without needing any libraries. All I need is file I&#x2F;O and the ability to split strings. It doesn&#x27;t get much simpler.<p>I&#x27;ll admit though that &quot;import JSON&quot; and then being able to essentially convert the entire file into a dictionary is nice if the data has more structure to it.

            The real advantage of CSV, in my mind, is that if the CSV is valid and normal then it&#x27;s going to be a rectangular dataset (ignoring semantics within the dataset).<p>If I import JSON data I have no idea what shape the result will be in, and it requires a separate standard to let me know about columns and rows and validation can get complicated.

            CSV is that way too. There&#x27;s nothing that says each row has to have the same number of what maps out to columns, or anything that tells me what those columns really represent (there&#x27;s no schema). You <i>could</i> use the first line of the CSV doc to say what each tuple is named, but that&#x27;s not a standard or anything. And without a schema, it certainly could be easy to lose the metadata of the info the CSV file is trying to represent. Is this column just a bunch of numbers or a date format? (for example). CSV is OK for importing and exporting data across systems that know what the format is without the help of a schema, but anything else and you run into a pile of edge cases. Even using a CSV file to import into a spreadsheet works <i>usually</i> but context is often lost.<p>Frankly, I love the format.

            CSV is still easier to parse because the C++ dudes still refuse to implement some kind of nice operator-overloaded interface like<p><pre><code>    #include &lt;json&gt;

    std::json myjson(&quot;{\&quot;someArray\&quot;: [1,2,3,4,{\&quot;a\&quot;: \&quot;b\&quot;}]}&quot;);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; (std::string)myjson[&quot;someArray&quot;][4][&quot;a&quot;];
</code></pre>
and the result is we have 50 different rogue JSON libraries instead of an STL solution. Until the STL folks wake up, boost::split can deal with the CSV.

            A string split function is a poor choice if there&#x27;s any possibility the CSV file contains quoted fields. Robust handling of both CSV and JSON requires a parser. In my experience, CSV can actually be trickier than JSON to parse because there are so many edge cases, alternatives, and ambiguities.

            As printed above, I&#x27;m not writing software where that would be a problem. In general if I was writing a commercial application or something in production where I don&#x27;t control all the inputs I would agree 100%, but I&#x27;m lucky to not have those problems. I could use a bunch of libraries and additional code to try to catch non-existent errors I don&#x27;t have, or fix my actual problems and move on.<p>I appreciate the perspective though for sure.

            You&#x27;ve assumed an awful lot about my use cases. The data I deal with in .CSV form is always pre-processed and doesn&#x27;t have any of the minefield occurrences you&#x27;ve mentioned. There can&#x27;t be a newline or anything like that in an input. In my decade of using .CSV files daily, I&#x27;ve only had one tertiary system where that is a problem.<p>Also, when doing interactive work, it&#x27;s a bit different than writing production IT software.

            I personally believe that at least SQLite matches all those criteria :<p>&quot;1) A truly open format is available&quot; : sqlite is open-source, MIT-licensed, and well specified (even though I am usually not so happy with its weak typing approach, yet in this case this precisely enables a 100% correspondance between CSV and sqlite since CSV has also no typing at all...)<p>&quot;2) Applications have a speed increase from using csvs&quot; : I think it should be obvious to everyone that this is the case...<p>&quot;3) The new format should not be grossly larger than the one it is replacing&quot; : this is also the case

            It&#x27;s worth mentioning that SQLite is committed by its publishers to be backward-compatible out to 2050 and is the recommended by the Library of Congress as a safe long-term storage format (as are XML, JSON, and CSV). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;locrsf.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;locrsf.html</a><p>For single tables a database is probably overkill, but it&#x27;s nice to have around when you need something reasonably powerful without being overly complex or hard to get started with.

            There is a definite demand for some import format that you can trivially edit - CSV excels at this right now and JSON isn&#x27;t that bad.  Binary dump formats definitely do have a time and a place but there is also a separate need for trivially human readable formats.

            My point is that the consultant needs to understand the capabilities of the client more so than dictating terms just because it is convenient to the consultant. The scenario you describe is not out of the realm of possibility, but it&#x27;s also not unheard of to have a client with such antiquated systems that there is no using of modern anything. Hence, why CSV will never die.

            Excel&#x27;s default insistence on trying to coerce the data into what it expects the data to be is the source of many of the problems of people using CSV. Excel will even ignore quotes around values if it thinks that the value inside might be a number. I often work with CSV files that contain 17 digit IDs that use numeric characters &quot;01233998742021925&quot; which Excel will convert lossily into scientific notation rather than leaving it as a string. There are ways to override that but they are tedious and people don&#x27;t do it by default.<p>I&#x27;d be satisfied if Excel was just a little less aggressive about it&#x27;s data coercion on import.

            Yep, you got me.  I&#x27;m actually a trapeze artist moonlighting on these forums.<p>A CSV file represents the exact digits that are to be stored.  You have unlimited precision.  You could even store irrational numbers, equations, or mix data types in a column.  OTOH, you have to make sure the delimiting character is not present in the data - that can be pretty easy, if you use the field-separator character in ASCII, or even just a \t.  I&#x27;ve even seen people terminate fields with ^8675309| because they felt confident no data would contain Jenny&#x27;s number.<p>A database, like Excel, likes to conform data.

            Agree. But a lot of this is tooling though, whether its adequate and whether its ubiquitously available. e.g. you can diff two directories in Linux, which is super useful, but directories are not text files. The issue is, can the differences be reasonably represented in text formatted output.

            Besides, CSV can be written by a human and initially it was the way how data was entered and read, because it is a text file - database. If there is a need for something more convenient, then there are other file types. Nonissue, IMO.

&gt; &quot;Simple text compression&quot;? Not sure what you are referring to there. If you are speaking of generalized compression, there&#x27;s a bunch of information theory pointing out the problem with that thinking.<p>For most natural text-only data, .csv.gz is probably close to the limits of what we can do. For numerical or categorical text containing patterns or structure, I agree that better formats may exist (e.g. H.264 for CSV files containing video frames). Not sure how a more general format will solve anything you couldn&#x27;t already do by converting to a more specific format and tarring everything afterwards.

            CSV uses decimal representations of numeric data, which means you are getting 3.5 bits of data for every 8 bits of storage space (and that&#x27;s assuming you are using a reasonably compact text encoding... if you are using UTF-16, it&#x27;s 16 bits). Using a binary representation you can store 8 bits of data for every 8 bits of storage space.<p>CSV uses a variety of date-time formats, but a prevalent one is YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ. I&#x27;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine whether that is as compact as an 8-byte millis since the epoch value.<p>CSV also requires escaping of separator characters, or quoting of strings (and escaping of quotes), despite ASCII (and therefore UTF-8) having a specific unit separator character already reserved. So you&#x27;re wasting space for each escape, and effectively wasting symbol space as well (and that&#x27;s ignoring the other bits of space for record separators, group separators, etc.).<p>Then there&#x27;s floating point data...<p>Honestly, this is a silly argument. CSV is, by design, a format that trades space for other factors. It should not be debatable whether it is a compact format or not.

            &gt; CSV uses decimal representations of numeric data, which means you are getting 3.5 bits of data for every 8 bits of storage space (and that&#x27;s assuming you are using a reasonably compact text encoding... if you are using UTF-16, it&#x27;s 16 bits). Using a binary representation you can store 8 bits of data for every 8 bits of storage space.<p>XML, JSON, and YAML all have this issue, too.<p>&gt; CSV uses a variety of date-time formats, but a prevalent one is YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ. I&#x27;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine whether that is as compact as an 8-byte millis since the epoch value.<p>This is also identical to XML, YAML and JSON.<p>And I know what you&#x27;re about to argue, but JSON&#x27;s datetime format is <i>not</i> in the spec. The common JSON datetime format is convention, not standard.<p>&gt; CSV also requires escaping of separator characters, or quoting of strings (and escaping of quotes), despite ASCII (and therefore UTF-8) having a specific unit separator character already reserved. So you&#x27;re wasting space for each escape, and effectively wasting symbol space as well (and that&#x27;s ignoring the other bits of space for record separators, group separators, etc.).<p>This is also identical to XML (escaping XML entities, sometimes having to resort to CDATA), YAML (escaping dashes) and JSON (escaping double quotes).<p>All you&#x27;ve shown is that CSV has the same limitations that XML, YAML, and JSON have, and those three formats specifically designed and intended for data serialization. Yes, the other formats do have other advantages, but they don&#x27;t eliminate those three limitations, either.<p>This is for data serialization, which means it&#x27;s going to potentially be used with data systems that are wholly foreign separating great distances or great timespans. What data serialization format are you comparing CSV to? What do you think CSV is actually used for?<p>Are you arguing for straight binary? You know that CSV, XML, YAML and JSON all grew out of the reaction to how inscrutable both binary files and fixed width files were in the 80s and 90s, right? Binary has all sorts of lovely problems you get to work with like <i>endianness</i> and some systems getting confused if they encounter a mid-file EOF. If you don&#x27;t like the fact that two systems can format text differently, you&#x27;re going to have a whole lot of fun when you see how they can screw up binary formatting. Nevermind things like, &quot;Hey, here&#x27;s a binary file from 25 years ago... and nothing can read it and nobody alive knows the format,&quot; that you just don&#x27;t get with plain text.<p>Yes, you do end up with a wasted space, but the file is in plain text and ZIP compression is a thing if that&#x27;s actually a concern.

            The issue is CSV is not compatible with CSV. It&#x27;s not possible to write a spec that covers all CSV files in the world. CSV means things that are mutually incompatible in the less common cases, and the only way to really parse them correctly is to know which variant generated it. But you can&#x27;t even tag that variant in the file by your criteria, as existing CSV parsers won&#x27;t understand it.

            Couldn&#x27;t tools that read CSV files scan them first and see which variant best matches the file?  The questions arise about which end of line character(s) are used and how double-quotes and commas are handled.  There can&#x27;t be that many ways to escape them, and there are three sets of end of line characters mentioned - just see which one is used (i.e. don&#x27;t assume only \n if you run into \r\n or \r alone).<p>The assumption that most software uses is that the import file will be in the same variant of the format as what that tool exports.

            It also doesn&#x27;t prevent a human or other system doing:<p>cat input1.csv input2.csv &gt; output.csv<p>resulting in a single file containing multiple formats.<p>Also, what variant is this:<p><pre><code>    1,5,Here is a string &quot;&quot; that does stuff,2021-1-1

What is the value of the third column?<p>Is this a CSV file without quoting? Then it&#x27;s<p><pre><code>    Here is a string &quot;&quot; that does stuff

            That&#x27;s true.  You could scan the file and see if there are any other types of double quote escaping happening, but if there isn&#x27;t any that wouldn&#x27;t help either.

            ASCII was well defined, CSV was not. Therefore they could take the highest bit, which they could know that was unused per the ASCII spec, and use that to encode their extra UTF-8 information.<p>Also UTF-8&#x2F;ascii compatibility is unidirectional. A tool that understands ASCII is going to print nonsense when it encounters emoji or whatever in UTF-8. Even the idea that tools that only understand ASCII won&#x27;t mangle UTF-8 is limited - sure dumb passthroughs are fine, but if it manipulates the text at all, then you&#x27;re out of luck - what does it mean to uppercase the first byte of a flag emoji?

            To be fair, there is basically no way to manipulate arbitrary text at all without mangling it, UTF-8-aware or not. What does it mean to take the first 7 characters of a UTF-8 string which might contain combinator characters and left-to-right special chars? What if the text uses special shaping chars, such as arranging hieroglyphs in cartouches? You basically need a text-rendering aware library to manipulate arbitrary strings.

            &gt; So someone opens this CSV in Excel and there&#x27;s garbage in A1?<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s why I chose the “thing that looks like a text file—including optionally CSV—but has additional metadata after the EOF mark” approach instead of stuffing additional metadata in the CSV; there&#x27;s no way to guarantee that existing implementations will safely ignore any added metadata  the main CSV body. (My mechanism has some risk in that there are probably CSV readers that treat the file as a binary byte stream and use the file size rather than a text stream that ends at EOF, but I expect its far fewer than will do the wrong thing with additional metadata before the first header.

            If by EOF char you mean Ctrl-Z, Python&#x27;s `csv` module is at least one case where it will read past the EOF char and you&#x27;ll get rows of garbage data for any content in the file after  that.

            That&#x27;s ignoring two big points in the OP: that CSV variants are ill-defined and conflicting; and that existing CSV data is too poorly-specified.<p>There is no reason to try to be &quot;backwards-compatible&quot; with existing CSV files - we don&#x27;t have a single definition of correctness to use to check that the compatibility is correct. Every attempt to be parse existing data would result in unexpected results or even data loss for some CSVs in the wild, because there is no way to reconcile all the different expectations and specifications that people have for their own CSV data.

            This is true. The best way would be if everyone generated CSV files that were compatible with on one or two already existing CSV formats. (e.g. no-quote-plain-old-csv or quotes-forced-csv.) Hopefully, it would be easy to distinguish between the two in some well-defined manner. Maybe call it .csvs (CSV standardized). Or just introduce new extensions like .csvq (&quot;CSV quoted&quot;).<p>Note the difference is that I am suggesting reducing the number of standards in-use by using only one already existing CSV format. :)

            No, they really do. But 99% isn&#x27;t 100%. Compare Python&#x27;s csv parser with Go&#x27;s. The former will prefer a parse for any input, and this is done in a fairly consistent way that at least gives one the opportunity to deal with &quot;malformed&quot; csv. The latter is a strict parser and coughs up an error upon almost any deviation from RFC 4180. I couldn&#x27;t use the latter in practice because of it. It would just choke on too many csv files I had.

            Every few years an article like this pops up. I find it tiring - because they are primarily from a software engineer&#x27;s viewpoint who is probably trying to write a parser and needs to handle the edge cases. As a data scientist, I receive and process around 75GB of CSV every day - of course I don&#x27;t process it manually. Our processes have been running a few years now and millions of dollars of revenue rides on it. I don&#x27;t see any need to retire anything, and am pretty sure our processes will be working and running 10 years from now. The only thing which will change are some statistical models which make use of this data.

            Yeah - I used to lead a department that would process somewhere around 10TB of CSV formatted data per day.<p>The edge cases are a hassle but they don&#x27;t become less of a hassle from a business perspective by switching to json or really any other format. We tried an experiment of using more json and eventually gave it up because it wasn&#x27;t saving any time at a holistic level because the &quot;data schema&quot; conversations massively dominated the entirety of the development and testing time.<p>Obviously being able to jam out some json helped quite a bit initially, but then on the QA side we started to run in to problems with tooling not really being designed to handle massive json files. Basically, when something was invalid (such as the first time we encountered an invalid quote) it was not enjoyable to figure out where that was in a 15GB file.<p>That said, I fully concur with the general premise that CSV doesn&#x27;t let you encode the solutions to these problems, which really really sucks. But, to solve that, we would output to a more columnar storage format like Parquet or something. This would let us fully encode and manage the data how we wanted while letting our clients continue working their processes.<p>What I would really like to see is a file format where the validity of the file could be established by only using the header. E.g. I could validate that all the values in a specific column were integers without having to read them all.

I have been struggling with data format decisions around a personal project that will only be used by a few people, being unsure about the extent i should try to make it bulletproof (but harder to maintain and modify) or just keeping it simple (but primitive). It&#x27;s helpful to see an experienced professional perspective showing that you can fall into a tooling rabbit hole at any scale.

            &gt; &quot;data schema&quot; conversations massively dominated the entirety of the development and testing time.<p>Agreed. JSON let&#x27;s me know something is a number. That&#x27;s great, but I still have to check for min&#x2F;max,zero etc. A string? That&#x27;s great, but I got to check it against a set of enums, and so forth. Basically, the &quot;types&quot; JSON gives you is about 20% of the work, and you&#x27;re going to have to parse things into your own types anyway.<p>&gt; What I would really like to see is a file format where the validity of the file could be established by only using the header.<p>Are you saying something like a checksum so not only is a schema provided but some method to verify that the data obeys the schema?<p>If you&#x27;re talking about just some stronger shared ontology, I think that&#x27;s a direction things will go. I call this concept &quot;Type the world&quot; or &quot;World Wide Types&quot;. I&#x27;m starting to think something like GPT-N will be the primary author, rather than a committee of humans like Schema.org.

            Honestly with the schema thing I&#x27;d probably be fine with either&#x2F;or!<p>A checksum would be crude and user-hostile, only being able to say &quot;you did it wrong&quot; but not really good at tell you what it means to do it right.<p>If I understand the concepts correctly then it seems like a shared ontology could potentially solve the problem in a non-hostile way.<p>Plus, it makes me happy because I feel like types are a real-world problem, so it is always nice if the type system could enforce that real-world-ness and all the messiness that comes along for the ride.

            We looked at it and there were a few problems we had with where it would force us to put VMs that we just weren&#x27;t super comfortable with due to the in-process-ness.<p>More a byproduct of decisions made 5 - 7 years ago when the company was in raw startup mode versus a more mature roadmap.

            That&#x27;s pretty much how I feel as well. People that complain about all the variations in CSV &quot;formats&quot; out there aren&#x27;t wrong but in practice, for me anyway, most of the files I work with in any given situation come from the same source or a small set of sources and use the same variant.<p>If&#x2F;when I get a data source introduced into my workflow that differs from this variant I come up with a routine to normalize it, integrate that into my workflow and move on.

            Pretty much the opposite here. Dealing with lots of different formats from different sources, often once off. There&#x27;s all kinds of crazy things people will call &quot;data&quot; (CSV &#x27;variants&#x27; are the tip of the iceberg).

            So you can constrain what type of CSV you will allow and if this happens it will bail.  It&#x27;s that simple.  There is nothing wrong with having additional constraints on top of just saying it must be &quot;CSV&quot; especially in these scenarios.<p>I&#x27;m in a similar situation, we&#x27;ve been using CSV for over a decade to move billions of dollars worth of product each year.

Of course there are edge cases and special cases depending upon specific workloads, but if your team has it&#x27;s own parser (which is a small amount of obvious code) then it does indeed usually become a simple fix.<p>Sounds good using someone else&#x27;s library, but below a certain complexity it&#x27;s rarely worth it in the medium to long term except for when doing proof of concept or demo code, or if the domain space is complex.

            We&#x27;ve got at least a few dozen customer integrations that parse CSV-ish files, and they all have a custom parser. Many of these have been chugging for over a decade, sending &quot;mission critical&quot; data back and forth.<p>It&#x27;s dead simple to whip up, and we can easily tweak it to whatever the customers software spits out, like one field suddenly being UTF-8 encoded in an otherwise Windows-1252 file.

            How does Unicode present a problem?<p>In UTF-8, the byte for a comma and a quote only exist as their characters.

            If you&#x27;re manually generating your own CSV files, you probably know what kind of data you are generating and consequently whether your data is going to contain commas. If commas and newlines don&#x27;t exist in your data, then you can safely ignore quoting rules when generating CSV files. I know that I&#x27;ve generated CSVs in the past and rather than figuring out the correct way to quote the strings, I just removed any inconvenient characters without any loss to the data at all. Obviously this is not &quot;correct&quot; but you don&#x27;t have to implement cases if you know they won&#x27;t show up.

            This is true, but a lot of data processing takes place in a context where frictionless export functionality is more important than a 100% guarantee of import compatibility. I&#x27;d rather ingest city = &quot;,CHANGSHA,HUNAN&quot; (real example!) than ingest nothing at all because my vendor doesn&#x27;t have time to integrate a JSON serializer.

Because the CSV format is so fuzzy you can very easily parse incorrectly and end up with a valid parse full of garbage.<p>Trivially: incorrect separator, file happens to not contain that separator at all, you end up with a single column. That&#x27;s a completely valid file, and might even make sense for the system. Also trivially: incorrect encoding, anything ascii-compatible will parse fine as iso-8859-*.

            I have a script which generates a CSV file using a bunch of print statements. The columns are hostnames and some numbers, so it is never going to contain commas or newlines. This will be perfectly valid CSV every time.<p>That’s why CSV is absolutely beautiful - there is a huge number of applications that people really care about, and their data is constrained enough that there is not need to care about CSV escaping and need for any third party libraries.<p>Creating XSLX file by hand is possible, but this will be a large amount of code and I wouldn’t include this in my script, it would need to be a separate library - which means build system support, learning the API etc...

            Also, &quot;will the other side adopt it?&quot;<p>After working with so many retailers and online sales channels, things that are considered &quot;legacy&quot; or &quot;outdated&quot; by the HN crowd doesn&#x27;t seem like it will go away unless both sides make a change. There are numerous articles posted on HN about how &quot;FTP is dead&quot; or no one uses it anymore, when it&#x27;s far from the case.<p>Even Amazon&#x27;s marketplace and vendor files are still using SFTP and EDI files. They&#x27;ve recently made changes, but it&#x27;s been slow and hasn&#x27;t had widespread adoption.<p>There&#x27;s also the universality and &quot;simplicity&quot; CSV provides to the non-computer literate, and convincing them to make a change to a new standard provides itself some non-technical challenges. CSV is a bad standard, but it&#x27;s the best one given what it does and its flexibility.

            Mainly Ctrl+F and diffs, in my case.<p>Sometimes you need to look up a single code in a 50 MB file. And sometimes you need a quick check to see if one line or a million lines changes.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;exception not the rule&quot; type stuff... but it sure comes in handy to be able to check this stuff quick with basic text tools than have to run it through some binary parser.

            Interesting. I would reach for `grep` and `diff` in those cases, so it&#x27;s not much of a leap to imagine similarly using a tool for a binary format. After all, I only need the textual representation of the thing I&#x27;m searching for, not the entire dataset.

            Interesting that the two main &quot;alternatives&quot; mentioned here are columnar data storages.  The problem I see with both Arrow and Parquet are that they are binary-based files.  Sure, binary files can be VERY efficient. But the &quot;magic&quot; behind files like CSV, JSON or YAML is that they are both &quot;sufficiently&quot; both human and machine readable.<p>Maybe a CSV killer would be a human readable columnar based file format.<p>Nevertheless, the article basically discusses the issues encountered with the manual &quot;editability&quot; of CSV files, not so much with its performance. It also mentions parquet or arrow and concedes that they require specialized format to read&#x2F;write.   If we are looking to that, then there are a lot of options such as sqlite format, BerkleDB (used by some cryptocurrency projects) among plenty of others.

            CSV isn&#x27;t supported in Excel because Microsoft prefers it. MS prefers its own Excel format. Excel supports CSV because a large enough majority of Excel users want it, which means MS includes support for it. For MS to remove CSV support in favor of Arrow or Parquet support would not benefit MS at all, and would make many of its customers push back, so I don&#x27;t see it happening.

            Objectively, CSV is terrible for humans despite being a plaintext format. No one reads CSVs: they&#x27;re incomprehensible since the columns are not aligned with the headings. (You might be drawing an analogy with JSON, which is often human readable because it puts the keys right there next to the values).<p>The best that can be said for its simplicity is that it&#x27;s easy to write code that can dump data out in CSV format (and to a lesser extent, it&#x27;s easy to parse it, though watch out for those variants). This is not a really strong argument, most everyone is going to use a library for serialization, there&#x27;s no reason to write your own unless it&#x27;s for learning.

            I recall one of my old Phones could dump SMS messages as CSV. I wanted to be build and interface that would let me search through my messages.<p>Turns out when you have data that contains both commas and quotes things get screwey real quick. You could have quoted data like:<p>123,ABC,”,””,456<p>Where <i>,”</i> is column data.<p>I think that standard method is to double quote the field, but the dump sure wasn’t doing that for me, plus what happens when the data is something like <i>abc””,</i>?

            Some people like me never generate CSVs like that. If someone sends me a CSV with quotes, I reject it and say &quot;clean up your data&quot;. It&#x27;s okay to say, &quot;we&#x27;re not going to allow escape characters in our CSV grammar. We&#x27;re going to have a higher standard&quot;

            Developer friendly. Not human friendly. I used to receive CSVs of product data from clients, which they often handcrafted or manipulated by hand, and inevitably, and I mean <i>inevitably</i>, broke.<p>Of course, excel will make just as much of a mess - when the client hands back their sheet with all of their UPCs expressed as exponents and æ€ ligatures jammed next to every apostrophe, there’s no guessing as to what happened.<p>In theory, it’s a great and simple format.<p>In practice, it causes much pain.

            Anything written by hand will be screwed up. Chances are if they&#x27;re writing it by hand and it&#x27;s badly formatted, they&#x27;re not using something that has input or output validation anyways, and they&#x27;re probably not going to budge from whatever workflow they&#x27;re using.

            Honestly though, if people are doing that with CSVs there is no system where they won&#x27;t also go off the reservation and do something insane with an excel file or sqlite or whatever. At least with CSVs there are common lines of code all around the internet to wrangle all sorts of issues.

            I try to use tab-delimited files when writing out columnar text to be loaded into something else (assuming it can parse them).  It&#x27;s even easier to read since you don&#x27;t have extraneous commas and double quotes everywhere and most viewers will line things up to some degree via the tabs.  Tabs are less common in data fields (at least when compared to double quotes and commas), at least in my experience.

            CSV files are terrible, but I love them. I love sites that offer an &quot;Export to CSV&quot; option, because I know I can take that export and start working with it immediately.

            I call this &quot;criticizing something without understanding why it succeeded in the first place&quot;. Also &quot;writing blog posts while blind to other users&#x27; use cases&quot;.<p>Do you really think there were no other &quot;portable&quot; formats to exchange data and SQLite is the first one?<p>The reason CSV is so popular has nothing to do with technical superiority which it obviously lacks.<p>The reason CSV is so popular is because it is dead simple and extremely easy to integrate within practically any conceivable workflow.<p>And because it is text format which you can trust, even if you have no other tools, you can inspect and edit in a text editor which is exactly the reason why other formats like INI, XML, JSON or YAML are so popular.<p>How would you:<p>a) Run shell command on a locked (can&#x27;t install anything) PROD server to find the files and write a report of the file location, date of change and file size so that it can be easily processed by something else? Return the data in stream on the same SSH connection?<p>b) Quickly add a line to an existing startup script to get a report of when the script is starting and stopping so you can import data to excel. You just need it for couple of days, then you delete it.<p>c) Produce a report you can send to your coworker knowing they don&#x27;t know how to program? And you don&#x27;t want spending time explaining to them how to make use of your superior file format?<p>d) You talk to another team. You need to propose a format and specify a report with as little effort as possible. You know they are not advanced technically so you keep things simple?<p>e) You are solving an emergency and have to cross-check some data with another team. You need to produce a file that they will be able to read and process. You are stressed for time so you don&#x27;t want to start a committee right now to find out shared technology. What would be safe choice without asking the other team for options?<p>f) A manager asked you for some data. You want to earn quick kudos. How will you send the data to get your kudos rather than irritating him?<p>These are all real life situations where CSV is being used.<p>As much as I understand <i>technical</i> arguments for SQLite, not every person is a developer. And all that technical superiority is worth nothing when they struggle to make use of the file you sent them.<p>I would say, the news of CSV&#x27;s death are greatly exaggerated.

            &gt; It&#x27;s Time to Retire the CSV<p>&gt; This column obviously contains dates, but which dates? Most of the world<p>It&#x27;s time to retire local formats and always write YYYY-MM-DD (which is both the international and the Swedish standard, and the most convenient for parsing and sorting).<p>&gt; A third major piece of metadata missing from CSVs is information about the file’s character encoding.<p>It&#x27;s bloody the time to retire all the character encodings and always use UTF-8 (and update all the standards like ISO, RFC etc to require UTF-8). The last time I checked common e-mail clients like Thunderbird and Outlook created new e-mails in ANSI&#x2F;ISO codepages by default (although they are perfectly capable of using UTF-8) - this infuriated me.<p>&gt; If not CSV, then what? ... HDF5<p>Indeed! Since the moment I discovered HDF5 I wonder why is it not the default format for spreadsheet apps. It could just store the data, the metadata, the formulae, the formatting details and the file-level properties in different dimensions of its structure to make a perfect spreadsheet file. Nevertheless spreadsheet  apps like LibreOffice Calc and MS Excel don&#x27;t even let you import from HDF5.<p>&gt; An enormous amount of structured information is stored in SQLite databases<p>Yet still very underused. It ought to be more popular. In fact every time I get CSV data I import it to SQLite to store and process but most of the people (non-developers) have never heard of it. IMHO it also begs to be supported (for easy import and export at least) by the spreadsheet apps. A caveat here is it still uses strings to store dates so the dates still can be in any imaginable format. Fortunately most of the developers use a variation of ISO 8601 conventionally.<p>And by the way, almost every application-specific file format could be replaced by SQLite or HDF5 for good. IMHO the only cases where custom format make good sense are streaming and extremely resource-limited embedded solutions.

            Almost nobody is a fan of the actual ISO 8601. It requires a big &#x27;T&#x27; to separate the date from the time - people consider this ugly and rarely implement this in the wild. People mostly use RFC 3339 which allows using a space instead of the &#x27;T&#x27;.<p>Both also require colons to separate hours and minutes and this makes it impossible to use in file names if you want to support accessing them from Windows.<p>I personally use the actual ISO 8601 (with the &quot;T&quot;) wherever I can, simple YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-SS-ffffff where I need to support saving to the file system (but this is slightly harder for a human to read) and mostly RFC 3339 (with a space instead of the &quot;T&quot;) wherever I need to display or to interop with tools written by other people. As for SQLite - I usually store every field (years, months,... seconds etc) in a separate integer column and create a view which adds an automatically generated RFC 3339 date&#x2F;time column for simpler querying.

            I had a great one today. I got a load file in (e-discovery world) that had my sent&#x2F;rev&#x27;d&#x2F;sort dates in &quot;mm.dd.yyyy hh:mm&quot; while my created and modified dates were &quot;dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm&quot;. I can&#x27;t fathom what piece of software sent that to me, and it wasn&#x27;t rocket science to fix in Excel.

            This is so just because no common software supports them (I don&#x27;t know why, the libraries are totally free - BSD and Public Domain).<p>And by the way, many (if not an overwhelming majority) of the non-programmers don&#x27;t even understand what does &quot;just text files&quot; actually mean, how do text files differ in nature from DOC files and how are CSV files different from XLS files.

            This has <i>so</i> many happy side effects. Yesterday I was upgrading some code to use a newer version of an API. The old version stored timestamps as int seconds-since-epoch, but the new one stored them as ISO8601 strings. I replaced a line of code like:<p><pre><code>  if row[&#x27;timestamp&#x27;] &lt; cutoff_time_as_int: ...
</code></pre>
with:<p><pre><code>  if row[&#x27;isotimestamp&#x27;] &lt; cutoff_time_as_string: ...
</code></pre>
and everything kept working exactly as before. There was no expensive and error prone date parsing involved, some some simple string comparison. It wasn&#x27;t quite as cheap as comparing ints, but it&#x27;s not performance critical code so eh, good enough.

            That&#x27;s not a problem inherent to CSV the format, though, any more than using Word to edit JSON means smart quotes are a problem with JSON.

            But the behaviour isn&#x27;t unexpected at all, e.g. the user wanted to store a number in column 3 and that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s the tool did. The behaviour is both expected and reproducible, the issue is that it&#x27;s not <i>communicated</i> by the format.<p>The problem arises from the fact that CSV doesn&#x27;t contain any metadata so while the same tool reads and writes the same data, the results will be different because the format doesn&#x27;t specify what a number look like.<p>The formats proposed in the article don&#x27;t have this problem because they specify both the type and the formatting of the file content so there&#x27;s no confusion.<p>That&#x27;s the difference. JSON in particular simply cannot have this problem (though it&#x27;s not a suggested  solution): a number has a well-defined format and that&#x27;s that. So do strings. This is not the case with CSV:<p><pre><code>  Number,Also a number,A String
  1.0,1e15,&quot;Hello there!&quot;
  &quot;1,0&quot;,1e15,&quot;Bienvenue á la maison!&quot;
</code></pre>
The first row is what you&#x27;d expect from a customer in Ireland and the second row might be sent from someone in Switzerland.<p>Both parties agreed to use comma-separated files for data exchange and quoted strings, yet importing the first row using a French locale would fail to parse the first number and same goes for the second row and an English locale.<p>Neither row contains unexpected or malformed data from the respective user&#x27;s POV. And that&#x27;s the problem with CSV.

            Yes CSV sucks, but beyond that this rant is...quite sloppy. In dismissing YAML and JSON it seems to confuse probability of corruption when using an editor that isn&#x27;t structure-aware with “lack of precision”, and then treats binary formats as better in this regard. Not only is the terminology bizarre, but the application of the criteria is nonsensical. Binary formats are not less likely to be corrupted when using an editor that isn&#x27;t specifically aware of the format, and JSON and YAML (especially when accompanied by explicit schemata) are no less amenable to structure (and, when used, schema) aware editors than binary formats are.<p>&gt; To usurp CSV as the path of least resistance, its successor must have equivalent or superior support for both editing and viewing<p>Since the author has already ruled (on spurious grounds) human readability and thus the usability of ubiquitous text editors as incompatible with requirements for a successor format, this is simply impossible.<p>&gt; If Microsoft and Salesforce were somehow convinced to move away from CSV support in Excel and Tableau, a large portion of business users would move to a successor format as a matter of course.<p>Yeah, sorry, you’ve put the cart before the horse. Neither of those firms are going to do that until the vast majority of users have already migrated off of CSV-based workflows, it would be an insane, user hostile move that would be a bigger threat to their established dominance in their respective markets than anything any potential competitor is likely to do in the foreseeable future.

            What a crock.<p>The author completely misses the point of what CSV files are useful for.<p>They are useful when both ends of the communication understand the context.  They know what the data types are, they know what the character encoding is etcetera.<p>This is a very common situation.  CSV files are easy to process, easy to generate, and can be read by a human without too much bother (they are not &quot;for people&quot; as the author so irritatingly asserts).  I have written so many CSV (and other delimiters, not just &#x27;,&#x27;) generators and processors I lost count decades ago.  It is so easy.<p>And what does &quot;retire CSV&quot; really mean?  Just stop generating them then!  The consumers of your data will probably insist you go back to them as writing all that code just to satisfy your fetish with metadata is not useful<p>Now I am whinging.....

            I don&#x27;t agree with the author&#x27;s thesis, but you&#x27;re wrong.<p>1. It is a very common use-case to load CSV data generated by an opaque system which did not specify the format exactly to you.<p>2. CSV files are _difficult_ to process I:  Fields are of variable width, which is not specified elsewhere. So you can&#x27;t start processing different records in parallel, since you have to process previous lines to figure out where they end. You can&#x27;t even go by some clear line termination pattern, since the quoting and escaping rules, and the inconsistencies the author mentions, make it so that you may not be able to determine with certainty that what you&#x27;re reading is an actual end-of-record or end-of-field. Maybe it&#x27;s all just a dream^H^H^H^H^H quoted string?<p>3. CSV files are _difficult_ to process II: For the same reasons as the above, it is non-trivial and time consuming to recover from CSV generation mistakes, corruptions during transmission, or missing parts of the data.<p>However - if you get some guarantees and abot field width and about the non-use of field and record separators in quoted strings, then your life becomes much easier.

It&#x27;s basically the same as regular CSV, but everything is UTF-8, the columns and lines are delineated by dedicated UTF-8 &quot;delineator&quot; codepoints (if they aren&#x27;t defined in the spec, find reasonable surrogates and use them), and therefore nothing ever needs to be escaped.<p>More human readable than regular CSV, less prone to error and just as easy to write to in a for loop (easier, in fact, as there are no escapes).<p>Depending on how Excel handles delineators, it should be able to import it too.

            I wouldn&#x27;t mind an updated standard to CSV that has the type information in the first line with the column labels.  I feel like this is all that CSV is really missing.  As a format where you can easily see and interact with the data in plain text if you need to nothing really beats CSV but I believe it could be made better, including strengthening standardization.  Eg, a CSV standards version header could be put at the top of the file to minimize import export difficulty.

            CSV isn&#x27;t going away any time soon. It is the only format that is supported by all data-oriented tools. Getting all those tools to agree on an alternative isn&#x27;t going to happen, especially given that that there are all these old tools that are no longer being updated, that produce and consume CSV.<p>Instead of finding a replacement for CSV it might be easier to standardize it and enhance it. Excel&#x27;s version of CSV is the de-facto standard. If you want a written-down spec that is available too [1]. To this we need to add enhancements such as a way to specify metadata (i.e., data type of each field). No need to find an alternative to CSV!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc4180" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc4180</a>

            There isn&#x27;t enough love for TSV imo. Unlike commas, tabs rarely appear in input data, so you don&#x27;t need complicated quoting or escaping rules. You just have tab and newline as special characters. Processing this data is extremely fast. Grepping for particular values is also very fast, as you can use the tabs as anchors when searching.<p>TSV allows you to do stuff on a single machine and GNU parallel that people would normally create a Hadoop cluster or 128GB database for.

            Strong agree. TSV is better than CSV always (unless you need to interface with an external system that doesn&#x27;t accept it).<p>For those not aware, TSV and CSV differ by more than just the delimiting character. TSV has a dead-simple specification: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;assignments&#x2F;media-types&#x2F;text&#x2F;tab-separated-values" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;assignments&#x2F;media-types&#x2F;text&#x2F;tab-separa...</a>.

            1) CSV can often be human readable at a glance (more so than most other formats, depending on that data), and that makes it appear deceptively simple and compact.  Possibly due to that, I&#x27;d bet most of us have been bit by a writer&#x2F;reader that doesn&#x27;t respect the RFC rules.<p>2) I ask for TSV, whenever convenient.  It&#x27;s been more reliable, and I don&#x27;t have a comprehensive why, but I think it&#x27;s slightly more resilient to writer&#x2F;reader inconsistencies, for me.  It may be that there&#x27;s just less need for escaping and quoting, so you might dodge a smart quotes debacle when asking for a one-off from an Excel user, for example.<p>3) Despite the issues raised, the notion we&#x27;d retire it makes me hug it tight, because for the majority of my requirements, it hits a sweet spot.  I still reserve the right to raise my fist in frustration when someone does: &quot;,&quot;.join(mylist).

            CSV is bad - but convenience is hard to beat. It&#x27;s the same thing with excel. People abuse it, but you just can&#x27;t beat the fact that your programmer, CEO, analyst, and secretary can all contribute to the same file.

            Yeah, this is pretty much it. The author complains about CSVs being &quot;notoriously inconsistent&quot; as though switching to some other format would magically change that. They&#x27;re only inconsistent because sometimes lazy programmers do &quot;,&quot;.join(mylist) instead of using an RFC4180 compliant CSV writer. Lazy programmers will just use non-compliant methods of creating whatever magic format OP is dreaming about. Case in point: trailing commas in JSON objects, and other ridiculous things that people have come up with such as encoding a date in JSON like this: &quot;\&#x2F;Date(628318530718)\&#x2F;&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;previous-versions&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;articles&#x2F;bb299886(v=msdn.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#intro_to_json_topic2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;previous-versions&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;ar...</a><p>CSVs also are great because you can parse them one row at a time. This makes for a very scale-able and memory-efficient way of processing very large files containing millions of rows.<p>Let there be no mistake: Everyone reading this today will retire long before CSVs retire. And that&#x27;s just fine by me.

This makes for a very scale-able and memory-efficient way of processing very large files containing millions of rows.<p>Even RFC4180-compliant CSVs can be incredibly memory-inefficient to parse. If you encounter a quoted field, you <i>must</i> continue to the next unescaped quote to discover how large the field is, since all newlines you encounter are part of the field contents. Field sizes (and therefore row sizes) are unbounded, and much harder to determine than simply looking for newlines - if you were to naively treat CSV as a &quot;memory-efficient&quot; format to parse, you would create a parser that would be easy to blow up with a trivial large file.

            The article&#x27;s strongest criticism of CSV is that it&#x27;s easy for someone to mangle it when manually editing. This is true.

It&#x27;s good to go. If it has even one comma, wrap the datum in double quotes; and if it also <i>contains</i> double quotes, then  double them.<p>Not complicated and covers every edge case. CSV is going nowhere. 1000 years from now, computers will still be using CSV.<p>The answer to his objections could be to extend the format to include metadata.

            There are probably valid uses for CSV, but more often than not, it&#x27;s the wrong choice.<p>As soon as data has any form of structure to it (and most data does).  CSV complicates everything.  Even for unstructured data, the problem of escape characters often shows it&#x27;s ugly head.  The moment your data contains a comma, tab, or space, you run into a nasty mess that, in the best case makes your system fail, and in the worst case silently adds corrupt data into the system.<p>Neither JSON nor XML suffer from that problem and both can easily be used in any scenario you&#x27;d use CSV.  The only argument against either format is they are a bit more bulky than CSV.

            Correct, and those methods of escaping are clearly defined in both specs.  In CSV, there is no universal escaping system.  It&#x27;s all over the board.<p>Any variable length text data format is going to run into issues when special characters are used in the data.

            Retiring CSV is as futile as retiring Unix pipes. It&#x27;s a text format for text manipulations, and there is nothing simpler and more ubiquitous than a new-line and comma delimited table. Simplicity and flexibility has its drawbacks, but the advantages clearly outweigh those drawbacks. So, it will never retire, as long as we use text and blob filesystems that don&#x27;t have interoperable structured metadata, across the board.

            CSV in general is terrible. CSV in particular is great.

            The whole point of CSV is that it&#x27;s simple. You don&#x27;t need and special libraries. If you can write hello world to a file you can make a CSV and more often than not it&#x27;ll just work. Yes somethings, like DNA, shouldn&#x27;t be CSV files. But don&#x27;t blame the tool for bad craftsmanship. There are more things that it works for than doesn&#x27;t.

            I have always wondered why there is so little use of the separators in ASCII (the file, group, record and unit separators with codes 28-31). They seem perfect for the job and it would be easy to forbid inclusion of those characters in fields.

            The more interesting question is to try to tease apart what led to CSV&#x27;s survival, despite all the warts. Clearly a combination of things, including accident. But I&#x27;ll point out some advantages:<p>- Repairability by mere mortals.  If you are competent enough to use Excel and are given bad data, you are competent enough to fix it. (Whether the dataset is too big for mere mortals to find the problem is a different issue.)<p>- Trivial serialization. It is super-easy to dump things to CSV. (This is probably also why there are so many annoying variants.)<p>- Usable by other tools. You don&#x27;t need special libraries to read it, so pipelines involving the usual suspects is possible. Importantly, there are a ton of different ways to do this sort of thing, so non-experts can frequently find something that works for them, even if it looks wonky to programmers.<p>All that said, I hate dealing with them, too.

            CSV (well TSV) as a format is a simple as it gets: one special code as field separator, and another one as line&#x2F;record terminator. Only that CSV&#x2F;TSV use chars available in text editors rather than the proper (archaic) ASCII C1 codes. Whatever the author has against CSV, I feel like starting a war against CSV is crazy, since any alternative is going to be worse when the problem isn&#x27;t the format as such, but folks misusing it or using it wrongly (eg. broken XML in RSS, broken JSON, whatever).

            Despite the similar names, TSV and CSV are very different, in more ways than just the delimiter. In particular, CSV tries to handle escape sequences but its various implementations do so in different ways. TSV just disallows tab characters within fields, so its specification extremely simple: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;assignments&#x2F;media-types&#x2F;text&#x2F;tab-separated-values" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;assignments&#x2F;media-types&#x2F;text&#x2F;tab-separa...</a>.

            And then a field needs to contain one of those characters and everything breaks. And they&#x27;re designed to be human editable, so the solution is to complicate parsing by using quoted fields instead of escape characters. Although someone might choose to use escape characters because there&#x27;s no spec so they can do whatever they want.

            For the start I would be happy if Excel would, in the German version, by default start to separate CSV values by comma and not semicolon. This &quot;bug&quot; did cost us alone hundreds of support hours. We fixed it by switching to XLS, but still CSV is out there and causing headaches (Mailjet for example can&#x27;t create correct CSV files - luckily SQLite can read them).<p>Microsoft -&gt; The name of the format is &#x27;comma separated values&#x27; not &#x27;semicolon separated values&#x27;!

            Just use a decimal point instead.  Switching the delimiters depending on locale makes it extremely impractical to use CSV for data interchange with continental European Excel users.<p>Microsoft Excel is the only program I know that insists on locale-specific interpretations of CSV.  To read a standard CSV into Excel in a continental European locale, you need to either switch your locale at the Windows level, or to manually set every delimiter in the Excel text import wizard (requiring multiple mouse clicks for each column).

            Here are the main advantages of Parquet over CSV (post author made these points more abstractly):<p>* Parquet stores schema in the metadata, so schema inference isn&#x27;t required (schema inference is expensive for big datasets)<p>* Parquet files are columnar so individual columns can be grabbed for analyses (Spark does this automatically).  This is a huge performance improvement.<p>* Row groups contain min&#x2F;max info for each column, which allows for predicate pushdown filtering data skipping.  Highly recommend playing with PyArrow + Parquet to see the metadata that&#x27;s available.<p>* Columnar file formats are easier to compress.  Binary files are way smaller than text files like CSV even without compression.<p>I wrote a blog post that shows how a Parquet query that leverages column pruning and predicate pushdown filtering can be 85x faster than an equivalent CSV query: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coiled.io&#x2F;parquet-column-pruning-predicate-pushdown&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coiled.io&#x2F;parquet-column-pruning-predicate-pushdown&#x2F;</a><p>CSVs are great for small datasets when human readability is an important feature.  They&#x27;re also great when you need to mutate the file.  Parquet files are immutable.<p>It&#x27;s easy to convert CSVs =&gt; Parquet&#x2F;Delta&#x2F;Avro with Pandas&#x2F;Dask&#x2F;Spark.<p>The world is already shifting to different file formats.  We just need to show folks how Parquet is easy to use and will greatly increase their analysis speeds &amp; they&#x27;ll be happy to start using it.<p>Small nit: the article implies Apache Arrow is a file format.  It&#x27;s a memory format.

            As long as it is text-based. At least you can actually look at a CSV and see what is going (wrong), as well as use all the text tools we have. Not that there aren&#x27;t problems as the article points out. But some binary file based on the whims of a proprietary program...no thanks.

            Gotcha.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s never really come up as it&#x27;s generally trivial to convert into this format from either a text editor or sed (Look for the `],[` and put a new line after the comma).

            I disagree.  Json, in particular, can be nearly as compact as CSV by storing the data as an array of arrays.<p><pre><code>    [[1,2,3],

It&#x27;s easy to make a structured data interchange format mimic and unstructured format.  It&#x27;s impossible to go the other way around without severe problems.

            It can be, but what&#x27;s ensuring that format when you read in a JSON file? JSON is one of the formats Pandas can read, but it has to be structured in a format the python library can read in as tabular data. Excel would have the same issue as would any program that is consuming tabular data. At least with CSVs, you know the data is tabular.

It&#x27;s part of whatever data contract you are making with whatever system is providing the data.  If someone shoves YAML into a Json file you&#x27;ve got problems, just like you have problems if someone starts talking about cars when you expected a file about airplanes.<p>At some point, you&#x27;ve got to turn file data into application data regardless of format.

            Correct.  That&#x27;d be a moving goalpost.  The original claim was that JSON doesn&#x27;t work well with columnar data.<p>If the primary usecase is to take data give it to a non-programmer to evaluate it, then CSV isn&#x27;t terrible.  Add a transformer that&#x27;s ran when someone manually requests to see the data.<p>However, for machine to machine communication, CSV should never be used.

            They answer their own question:<p>&gt;Most of us don’t use punch-cards anymore, but that ease of authorship remains one of CSV’s most attractive qualities. CSVs can be read and written by just about anything, even if that thing doesn’t know about the CSV format itself.<p>Yes, we keep CSVs. If you care about metadata and incredibly strict spec compliance, then yes: avro, parquet, json, whatever. But most CSV usage is <i>small</i> data, where the ease of usage, creation, and evaluation wins.<p>One of the problems with CSVs he cites is a great reason why I like CSVs:<p>&gt;CSVs often begin life as exported spreadsheets or table dumps from legacy databases, and often end life as a pile of undifferentiated files in a data lake, awaiting the restoration of their precious metadata so they can be organized and mined for insights.<p>A benefit of a CSV is a skilled or unskilled operator can evaluate these piles of aging data. Parquet? Even SQLite? Not so much.<p>For small-to-medium sized datasets, CSV is great and accessible to a wider user base. If you&#x27;re relying on CSV to preserve structure and meta, then meh.

            Every year this question comes up, and every year the arguments are the same.<p>It&#x27;s an exercise in hubris because while CSV has one glaring fault, it is far fewer than other competing methods of the simplest possible exchange of textual data.<p>No one can decide to retire CSV because it ubiquitous. Of the three issues OP compains about: line delimiter, field delimiter, and header, only one is really a problem for anyone that has used them for any period of time.<p>1. Every file format suffers from Windows&#x2F;NonWindows CRLF issues.<p>2. Metadata has been an issue since forever, and there are plenty of painful formats that support it (looking at you XML), complete with ginormous parsers and even more issues.<p>3. Escaping, as OP points out, was pretty clearly defined in RFC 4180.<p>So yes, it has a wart: escaping.<p>Learn what your system expects, and modify accordingly. Because using a CSV will be much faster and simpler than any other format you can try, which is why it has been so pervasive for longer than most of HN has been alive.

            CSV is ubiqitous. That&#x27;s a massive advantage. If you argue against using CSV you might make it less ubiquitous. You&#x27;re never going to make anything as ubiquitous as CSV though and that&#x27;s amply demonsrated by the fact that when you look at alternatives you immediately name 7 different things. And some of the advantages aren&#x27;t even necessarily advantages - a file format storing typed values is a non-trivial consideration when you&#x27;re thinking about cross-tool support. Pandas is cursed with this even in CSV - there wasn&#x27;t an optional int so any column with missing values must be float, and floats don&#x27;t necessarily handle large integers - have fun with your nanoseconds going funny in your nanosecond timestamps stored as optional ints.<p>CSV is ubiqituous because it&#x27;s <i>not</i> trying to solve difficult problems. The second you try to solve the difficult problems you necessarily fragment your audience.

            As the author of a CSV munging tool (CSVfix) I think most of the problems with CSV could be fixed if people producing CSV output, and people reading CSV input obeyed the rules of the RFC. Sadly, most people don&#x27;t, and any textual output or input is routinely described as CSV, when it is nothing of the sort - even to the extent of not being comma-separated!

            CSV was a thing long before I was born, so I&#x27;m not privy to how it came about. But at least in day-to-day work, the single biggest drawback of CSV in my experience is the fact that the comma and most of the other common delimiters occur regularly in real data, forcing all of the cumbersome escape sequences. To say nothing of someone misplacing a quote somewhere and throwing off the cell count.<p>So, question to the greybeards:  when this format was coming about, why didn&#x27;t we use one of the dedicated Data Structure separator control codes (e.g. File&#x2F;Group&#x2F;Record&#x2F;Unit separator) that were part of the ASCII standard?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C0_and_C1_control_codes#Basic_ASCII_control_codes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C0_and_C1_control_codes#Basic_...</a><p>It seems like it would&#x27;ve saved us all several decades of headache.

            Agree that the commma delimiter is a pain, as it is a frequently used character in the content.

            Csv is only one form of delimited files.  Tsv or Tab Separated Values is yet another.  If you have either field delimiters or row delimiters (new line) in your data, change your delimiters and process appropriately.

            Several things in this article resonated with me negatively. But I think these two are the biggest ones:<p>&gt;values stored in the files are typed.
&gt;most importantly, these formats trade human readability and writability for precision<p>Those two properties are advantageous only when CSV is used in cases meant to be just parsed and as a data transfer format. But in reality, CSV files are being used in many different contexts. For instance, data scientists love to leverage and chain Unix tools to create a subset of data to test models. Also, it is often used as an export format to validate outputs quickly.<p>I think the problem is that CSV is often the subject of abuse. In the same way that a spreadsheet is a subpar database, I don&#x27;t believe we are nearly close to the time when we will retire Excel.

            I think a key element for any potential replacement of CSV is parser simplicity. Writing a basic CSV parser by hand is not very difficult (i.e. ignoring stuff like escaped characters and quotes) compared to writing a SQLite parser. Regardless if it is binary or not, it should be possible to print out a usable grammar on a single sheet of grammar and said grammar should be LL(1) so at most you would need to write a recursive descent parser.<p>Suppose someone wants to do some data processing client side in the browser with an input file. How would you do this for SQLite, even a SQLite file with a known schema such as would be the case most of the time for CSV file uploads? There is sql.js which compiles SQLite to JS or WASM, but even the WASM version weighs in around 400kb.

            The premise is that CSVs are in widespread use and not suitable for their used purposes.<p>The conclusion is that there are many binary formats which are more suitable, except that none are used widely enough, and the post even goes on to <i>not</i> make a recommendation.

            XML? Which is often not human readable, overly complex and therefore requires enormous amounts of processing power to be parsed.<p>JSON - and also CSV - are ubiquitous because they are actually human readable and usually quick to process. JSON is strictly defined it just doesn&#x27;t over comments or structures, like XML. CSV is loosely defined but better than another competing standard ;)<p>A good data interchange format must be human readable, JSON and CSV are. Proprietary stuff not. And if you feel the need for speed? Seriously? Okay, then think about a binary format.<p>I prefer also the .conf format (so called INI) over other complex stuff for application settings.

            I&#x27;m kinda surprised this references RFC-4180 as the most formal spec when there is a _much better_, and more realistic, spec developed by the W3C csv on the web working group (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;csvw&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Main_Page" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;csvw&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Main_Page</a>)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;2015&#x2F;REC-tabular-data-model-20151217&#x2F;#parsing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;2015&#x2F;REC-tabular-data-model-20151217&#x2F;#...</a><p>... at the time RFC-4180 came out, it didn&#x27;t even accurately describe how to read csv produced by Excel - which was already inconsistent in line endings and character set between office versions and platforms. The w3c spec at least tried to offer a model which would parse junk csv if you could guess the metadata (by eg scanning for the BOM, \&quot; vs &quot;&quot;[^,],  and so on)<p>When I worked on this stuff early 2010s, if you wanted to produce a non-ascii csv _download_ that could be opened by all office&#x2F;openoffice variants you were out of luck. UTF-16LE-with-BOM, as I recall, would work in _most_ office variants but not consistently even across minor version changes in Office for OSX - so it was just a roll of the dice. We offered multiple download formats which _could_ handle this but csv was required by some customers.<p>Anyone saying csv is easy never worked with it in an international context.

            Under many scenarios it&#x27;s not currently possible. As one example, I use SQL Developer extensively, and neither its XML or JSON exports include metadata,
So that&#x27;s no more useful than CSV. Excel is a no-go for anything with &gt; 1M rows. Exporting large datasets leaves me with CSV since it&#x27;s easier for recipients to parse than XML or JSON without additional work. And querying Oracle from within Python or R suffers a big performance hit over doing it directly from SQL developer, so for one-off projects I don&#x27;t bother building a pipeline. (Repeat projects I&#x27;ll build and schedule for downtime, or on a different PC.)

            Let me define a sane CSV standard:<p>1. Encoding is UTF-8.<p>2. Header line with column names is mandatory. If there are no column names, the first line must be blank.<p>3. Each record is a line. A line is defined according to the operating platform&#x27;s text file format.<p>4. In the light of (3) CSV does not dictate line endings and does not address the conversion issue of text files from one platform being transferred to another platform for processing. This consideration is a general text issue, off-topic to CSV.<p>5. CSV consists of items separated by quotes.  An item may be:<p>5. a) a JSON number, surrounded by optional whitespace. Such an object may be specially recognized as a number by the CSV-processing implementation.<p>5. b) the symbol <i>true</i>, <i>false</i> or <i>nil</i>, optionally surrounded by whitespace. These symbols may have a distinct meaning from &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot; or &quot;nil&quot; strings in the CSV-processing implementation.<p>5. c) a JSON string literal<p>5. d) any sequence of printable and whitespace characters, other than comma or quote, including empty sequence.<p>6. In the case of (5) (d), the sequence is interpreted as a character string, after the removal of leading and trailing whitespace. (To preserve leading and trailing whitespace in a datum, a JSON literal must be used.)<p>7. In (5), whitespace refers to the ASCII space (32) and TAB (9) character. If there are any other control characters, the processing behavior is implementation-defined. Arbitrary character codes may be encoded using JSON literals.

            AFAICT, XML fulfils all of the requirements of this.<p>It is self describing, rigorously defined for the machine, highly flexible, highly extensible, human readable, text-based and an open format, and it is only mentioned as a storage format in the post, not even nearly doing it justice!<p>XML is complex, but there&#x27;s already very established libraries for handling it, so that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, and that&#x27;s the only drawback XML has.<p>Hell, even alternatives like JSON&#x2F;YAML + JSONSchema exist, still providing incredibly rigorous validation, but staying human readable and ubiquitous.<p>P.S.

            I had anticipated the overhead of XML being brought up, hence the other suggestions there, which is anything + jsonschema. jsonschema was used for illustrative purposes, it&#x27;s a lot more powerful than most usecases call for, and it pays forward for that by making the syntax very verbose and longwinded.

This example was sketched up in minutes and already reads better than most spreadsheets I&#x27;ve seen over the years!<p><pre><code>  &lt;bankstatement&gt;
      &lt;transaction date=&quot;2021-08-19&quot; description=&quot;Hello, world!&quot;&gt;

            While weird schemas are an implementation-specific issue, the fact remains that most XML that I&#x27;ve seen in commercial settings is exactly as unreadable as I described. It&#x27;s harder to go against the grain of the status quo when very few people accompany you on the journey.

            One of my goals with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasette.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasette.io</a> is to offer a better alternative for publishing data than sharing a link to a CSV file.<p>The trick is that if you compile data into a SQLite file and then deploy the Datasette web application with a bundled copy of that database file, users who need CSV can still have it: every Datasette table and query offers a CSV export.<p>But... you can also get the data out as JSON. Or you can reshape it (rename columns etc) with a SQL query and export the new shape.<p>Or you can install plugins like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasette.io&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;datasette-yaml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasette.io&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;datasette-yaml</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasette.io&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;datasette-ics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasette.io&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;datasette-ics</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasette.io&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;datasette-atom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasette.io&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;datasette-atom</a> to enable other formats.

            20 years ago, clever consultants said the same when XML was the “next big thing”. I remember reading this book called “The XML Revolution”, which boldly stated that the age of CSV and other “obscure” formats was finally over. Here we are 20 years later with the same rhetoric. CSV isn’t pretty, no, but it’s universally acceptable and works quite nicely on a Unix command line with cat, grep, and cut, so I am sure it will stick around for longer.

            CSV parsing is not as bad as it sounds and can be a decent fizzbuzzy interview question.<p>The real problem with CSV is the lack of vision of data formats in general. Inside your programming language you need to say that you want to read a CSV? You need to import a different library and change both the parse code and your consumption code to instead do JSON? You need to change everything to use futures in order to stream the results? Are you out of your damn mind?<p>So now that disk space is so cheap it would make sense for any file format to just begin with a single few-kilobytes line that defines the parser for the coming file. Could be sandboxed, WASM-y or something, could be made printable of course... Sure, it might not be possible to get the full SQLite library in there but you could at least make it free to switch between JSON and BSON and CSV without having to recompile the software or force someone to design modular file input systems. Somehow the only flexible containers that hold different data structures are video container formats that do not care about what codec you used. They &quot;get it&quot;— can the rest of us?

            1. I wouldn&#x27;t bet Avro, Parquet, Arrow, or other formats that require a library to parse are going to _entirely_ replace CSV. Those are broader in scope, but can&#x27;t say are &quot;replacements&quot; if they don&#x27;t share the simplicity of plain text data following a few conventions – much like how PDF is not a &quot;replacement&quot; for Markdown, but enables higher-fidelity content.<p>2. I would feel safer storing longer-term data in CSV than in a binary format w&#x2F; a complicated spec. Having to make sense of compressed, columnar padded data sounds worse than parsing CSV.<p>3. Although it&#x27;s easy to point at corner cases, I don&#x27;t remember the last time I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to parse a file because of inconsistent quoting or exotic char encoding – and I&#x27;ve spent a good amount of the past 13 years exchanging CSVs and TSVs w&#x2F; 3rd parties full of horrible legacy. Asking those 3rd parties to send me an Avro&#x2F;Parquet&#x2F;whatever file would&#x27;ve made the project fail or take 10x longer.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why CSV stuck around so long, and the alternatives make different trade-offs but miss the pros.

Just an example of the wonderful world of CSV \(<i>.</i>)&#x2F; which I&#x27;ve used quite a lot, because it enables quick and easy (dirty) data dumps&#x2F; exchanges. But using it as a data exchange format between multiple parties often leads to problems, such as above.

            CSV will never go away. But surely we can build better systems to handle all the complexities and variability in CSV? If we can handle image recognition with all its complexities, we can handle the more constrained variety in CSVs. There are only so many variations to CSV files, and perhaps a better preprocessor is the answer here versus asking for the near-impossible task of &quot;retiring&quot; CSV.

            CSV is perfectly fine for bring data from one App to another App. Is is easy. Everybody can fix things with any editor. You can paste files together, you can seperate files after x lines. Of course not everything is perfect .. and Microsoft made it even worser in the german office. The seperator is not even &quot;,&quot; it is &quot;;&quot;. The author writes about problems with dates .. i think we everybody saw excel translate dates to funny floats and so on. His problem with the date format is not a csv problem. The official standart is just not accepted in dayli life. Americans have anyway the most terrible ways to write dates. There is everything lost .. 
CSV is almost perfect for the usecase to bring data from one app to another without trouble.

            I feel the author&#x27;s pain. I have written a CSV parser from scratch and despaired at the lack of a decent standard for line endings, escaping, encoding etc (Excel and Numbers don&#x27;t even agree on how to import the same CSV file). But CSVs aren&#x27;t going away any time soon and I think the author is naive to suggest vendors should stop supporting CSV.<p>For a start, think about it from a game theory perspective. If I keep CSV import&#x2F;export in my Easy Data Transform product, while all my competitors with data transformation software (Alteryx, Knime etc) remove it from theirs, it gives me a big sales advantage. What advantage do I get for removing already working CSV import&#x2F;export code? Nothing.

            CSV files can be made much nicer by the simple switch to tab-delimited. It doesn&#x27;t solve all the issues by any means, but makes <i>just enough</i> of a difference to be &#x27;okay&#x27;.<p>Whatever is used, I like that tab-delimited (or even csv) is a human-readable and always-machine-readable long-term data format in the same way as ASCII (or Markdown etc) is for text. A hundred years from now, assuming the storage medium is still usable, the content should be easily recoverable. That may not be the case with spreadsheet files or other structured data formats.

            I might have a different perspective than most, but I think csv as a raw access method is far better than any structured format.<p>The contract on what is transfered or how it&#x27;s mapped in your csv is developer to developer and not in code.<p>This is a problem and also a benefit.<p>As long as both systems are designed to read and write the csv correctly(there in also the problem of verification), csv works flawlessly and retains its simplicity.

            Yeah, that&#x27;s a dumb idea.<p>Sometimes -- frequently, even -- you have to go to some least-common-denominator format to move data around. CSV is often a candidate.<p>When I was younger I thought we&#x27;d eventually abandon &quot;primitive&quot; formats like this, but in my middle years I realize their extreme utility.

            I&#x27;m going to get downvoted, but I&#x27;ll ask, who cares? You may have perfectly valid reasons to not like CSV, but it&#x27;s choice at the end of the day to use it or not. Maybe you didn&#x27;t make the choice, and inherited a system that does, but I much rather read an article about how you changed minds and&#x2F;or switched to something more advantageous for you and your system versus what amounts to a rant. It&#x27;s not time to retire CSV, it&#x27;s time to retire the mentality that just because you don&#x27;t like something doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wrong or needs to go away.

            I’m going to cite “worse is better” in disagreeing completely with the author.  CSV has won because it’s easy to generate, easy to read as a human, easy to parse with standard tools (when generated correctly), and really the last point is the salient one.<p>The format isn’t inherently flawed, though much like other less than perfect standards (I’m looking at you SMTP), the implementations frequently are.<p>And also, much like the author, I’ve been “professionally” dealing with data in all (most?) its forms for the length of my career (~25 years).

            CSV is often used as a database-agnostic data dump file. Since the author suggested sqlite as a possible alternative to CSV, I think that using sqlite as a database-agnostic data dump file actually sounds pretty good. For starters, all data is kept in one file instead of being spread out over multiple CSV files. Also, the data schema is already well defined inside an sqlite file. All you need is a tool that can read the sqlite file and write the data out accordingly to other databases depending on dialect.

            I love CSV. Only change I want is some way to indicate a comment. Then I can write a human readable description of what the data means (more than just column names, but how it is calculated). It would be cool if the comment mechanism also could have a machine readable metadata system.

            In e-Discovery our metadata is exchanged in csv format almost exclusively with one caveat, the defacto delimiters are Pilcrow and Thorn. We&#x27;ve solved the quote&#x2F;comma in data problem, but as soon as we start mixing character sets, someone writes a load file in ANSI all hell breaks loose.

            The least fun csv-like format i have seen was mandated by a Big Spanish Bank. It was original a fixed fieldwith flatfile. Numerals were 0-leftpadded and fixed decimal (decimal point not written). Except that someone decided they needed to open it in Excel so semicolons were added at the end of each field. Then they discovered that some data didn&#x27;t actually fit in the fixed with fields. So <i>certain</i> fields where variable width.
End result was a file that looked like shit in Excel, and couldn&#x27;t be parsed by a fixed width parser.

            The only reason CSV is hard to parse is that text editors made it hard to type ANSI 29, 30, and 31: the group, record, and field separators. So folks had to resort to comma or pipe and newline.<p>If you use the right characters built specifically for this purpose, then the problems go away.

            When I see someone complaining about the loss of metadata, I have to wonder if they&#x27;ve ever had to deal with a swamp of data from different organizations, all of which disagreed on when to use what piece of metadata in what way.<p>Bad CSV is a PITA, but usually you can make reasonable sense of it.

            It&#x27;s time to reinvent the wheel, but more complex, more failure-prone. No thanks !
Joke aside good alternatives exist, but are far less ubiquitous. Binary format means problems to read, compatibility issues... Look at how hdf5 is a complex format with a lengthy spec.
Checksum and compress your csv files, it will solve most issues.

            An SQLite dump is human readable and the data in the dump actually is in a CSV format, just surrounded with information on types and relationships.

SQLite dumps would actually be a pretty good data exchange format. As mentioned there is a CSV inside there. It&#x27;s not hard to extract that if you need an unadorned CSV--some grep and sed, or grep and cut, or a few lines of scripting.<p>Or if you have SQLite installed, it is an easy to have SQLite itself read the dump and export it in CSV, letting it deal with things like quoting that can be a pain with grep and sed&#x2F;cut. This way also makes it easy to rearrange or omit columns and to do some filtering so that data you don&#x27;t care about doesn&#x27;t get into the CSV.

            Excel definitely opens CSV files, and Windows file associations tend to set that up by default.
However, Excel then goes ahead with changing the content to often wrongly-assumed formats. My favourite hate is how it will convert mobile numbers from a string of digits to an unusable exponential-format number. Hey, it doesn&#x27;t even set column widths to make the content visible!

            Many JSON Parsers already have an incremental forward read mode (think SAX-style parser if you are familiar with XML parser styles) where you can ask for each array inside that array of arrays one at a time as it reads them. If something unexpected happens at the end of the large outer array such as syntax error you can decide at that point if you rollback what you&#x27;ve already read&#x2F;operated on or not.<p>JSON.Parse() in the browser isn&#x27;t that sort of parser obviously, but there options in many languages such as both major .NET JSON libraries (Newtonsoft and System.Text.Json) have ways to parse that way. Similar examples exist in other languages too.

            Interesting thought experiment that feels good after struggling with some thorny data corruption issues (or whatever inspired this), but this what they call a boil-the-ocean problem.

            I know that there&#x27;s an xkcd comic about this but I think that the best solution would be to create a new text based format with a new extension ie. &quot;bsv&quot; - better separated values. This new format would either be much stricter than csv or have a compulsory header that defines the file&#x27;s format (like the text encoding, separator character etc).<p>If it is stricter, it would have one type of field separator that is not commas since some locales use them as decimal places (I&#x27;m looking at you, France) but something like &#x27;|&#x27;. It would insist that dates were iso8601. It could define how fields can be escaped and quoted - although I would prefer if quoting was kept to a minimum. The format should also allow for comments i.e # so that people can comment their datasets inside the same file.<p>Alternatively or in addition, it could have some header lines:<p>1) A header that defines the encoding, separator, decimal separator, quote character, escape character, line ending character, date format ...<p>2) A header that defines each column&#x27;s name<p>3) A header that defines each column&#x27;s data type and formatting<p>4) A header that defines each column&#x27;s unit like m&#x2F;s or kg - ok, this is a bit of a stretch but it would be great to have.<p>or some variation of the above.<p>Fundamentally, this bsv format would still be csv and most programs would still be able to read it with the parsers that already exist or be quickly adapted to read it. It could still be easily edited by hand but the metadata would be present.<p>I suspect that this is just a pipe dream because people would find hundreds of ways to break it but toml took off and that didn&#x27;t exist so long ago.

I think you&#x27;ve got to integrate some type of live semantic schema, something like Schema.org. If I used &quot;bsv&quot; and didn&#x27;t just get a slightly better parsing experience but also got data augmentation for free, or suggested data transformations&#x2F;visualizations, et cetera, then I could see a community building.<p>I think perhaps a GPT-N will be able to write it&#x27;s own Schema.org thing, using all the world&#x27;s content, and then a BSV format could come out of that.

            While it’s great to dream I hope the CSV file stays around until I retire.  Still the best way to get ‘simple’ data out of excel and uploaded on the front end (papa parse).  More complicated data most likely should be using another format.  I guess there is always TSV if the CSV goes away :)

            The author seems to be advocating for something like ISO 20022.  
Which is great if you actually need it.  But also complete overkill if you aren’t doing the kind of things it’s made for (and even then, still a bit painful) 
CSV is at the other extreme but this is also why it’s so useful.

            I really wanted to like XML but every book I picked up about it was so awful, and every XML browser program I tried so unbelievably slow, that I just gave up trying to figure it out when it was still current. I didn&#x27;t need it for work; I just thought the concept was cool and it&#x27;d be a fun thing to know. Perhaps people were so eager to prove it was powerful that they ended up making it seem like something for masochists.

            HDF5 is efficient for large datasets and has its use cases but being a binary (and fairly easy to corrupt) it isn&#x27;t a reasonable general replacement for CSV. It also has limitations such as it cannot be read while it is being written.

            My problem with CSV is that it has a logical, obvious structure that is practically self-evident. The very act of having to write an encoder and then a parser makes the various corner-cases inescapable, which means that it is almost impossible to imagine getting it wrong.<p>Yet, <i>everbody</i> gets it wrong. Everybody. Thoroughly, fantastically, almost unimaginably wrong.<p>For example, in the Microsoft world: I come across CSVs in about 5 scenarios, all of them very common, most of them designed to interact: Excel, PowerShell&#x27;s Export-CSV, SQL Server, Power BI, and the Azure Portal. None of these are obscure. None of these use CSV infrequently. Yet, <i>they&#x27;re all mutually incompatible!!!</i><p>That just blows my mind.<p>For example, SQL Server will output string &quot;,NULL,&quot; to represent a null field instead of just a pair of commas (&quot;,,&quot;), so every other tool will convert this to the <i>string</i> &quot;NULL&quot;, which is not a null.<p>PowerShell helpfully outputs the &quot;type&quot; of the value it is outputting, like so:<p><pre><code>    PS C:\&gt; dir | ConvertTo-Csv
    #TYPE System.IO.DirectoryInfo
    &quot;PSPath&quot;,&quot;PSParentPath&quot;,&quot;PSChildName&quot;,&quot;PSDrive&quot;,&quot;PSProvider&quot;,...
</code></pre>
Excel can&#x27;t open such files! It is entirely unfathomable that the PowerShell team <i>wrote this code</i> and never once double-clicked the resulting CSV to see if it opens successfully in Excel or not. Absolutely mindblowing!<p>It just goes on and on.<p>Different quoting rules. Random ability&#x2F;inability to handle new lines. Different ways of handling quoted versus unquoted string values. Encoding is UTF-8 by default or not. Handling of quote characters within strings. Etc, etc...<p>Basically, within <i>one vendor&#x27;s ecosystem</i>, flagship applications have at best a 50:50 chance of opening arbitrary CSV files.<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on the inherent ambiguities of the format, like interpreting dates, times, or high precision decimals, etc...<p>Oh, and before I forget: the SQL Server Integration Services team wrote lengthy articles on how their engine can process CSV files faster than the competition. Why is this a feature? Because CSV is a woefully inefficient format and processing it fast is an <i>achievement</i>.<p>Lastly: By default, SQL Server cannot export table data to a flat data file and round-trip it with full fidelity, in any format. Exchanging just a couple of tables between servers is... not fun.<p>So yes, a replacement format with an efficient, high-fidelity binary format is long overdue.

            This is a pet peeve of mine: csv was a bad format already when it was created, because it intermixes data with meta data, ie it uses characters that can appear as either data or control characters, leading to escaping issues. This is in addition to being under specified as to which characters are used as control characters.<p>It was outdated from the start because ASCII already has specific characters for file, group, record, and 
item separation. Using this would give broad compatibility and a wider feature set (eg. more than one table in a file) while retaining all the benefits of csv.

            It&#x27;s probably not news to anyone who works with data that CSVs are inferior to other file formats like parquet.<p>I think the valuable insight here is that there needs to be a meme &#x2F; movement that CSV is bad or deprecated.

            The thing is, I need a hefty library to write parquet. I can write a CSV with a couple fprintf statements and a loop. A parser isn&#x27;t much harder if we can make assumptions about CSV dialect ahead of time.<p>If I&#x27;m trying to make an exportable format for a data logger with an SD card running on an ARM microcontroller, it doesn&#x27;t get much easier than CSV. Sure, I could save space by rolling my own binary format, but then I have to provide a PC application to read it (and realistically, the user is probably just going to want that application to dump to a CSV anyway!).<p>I agree that for many use cases there are much better alternatives, but one of the reasons CSV is so popular is because it&#x27;s so simple. It shouldn&#x27;t be used for multi-gigabyte datasets, but for many simple use cases it works great.

            no. you can&#x27;t write CSV with a couple of fprintf statements in a loop. If your data has a comma or a double-quote in it, the field needs to be surrounded by double quotes (and the double quote needs to be doubled). Ditto if you have leading or trailing spaces.<p>that is... if you&#x27;re following the RFC 4180 guidance for CSV. microsoft has another internal standard that occasionally gets referenced.

            I&#x27;m with you! But what does a hot new startup do when a rich old legacy corp sends them a data dump that isn&#x27;t a custom sqlite database?  Slowly but surely, the startup begrudgingly uses csv &quot;just this once&quot; until they grow into the legacy corp that sends out files in csv because &quot;we&#x27;ve done it this way forever.&quot;<p>And the cycle continues.

            CSVs are plain text, and that&#x27;s huge, plus they have a few other advantages:<p>1. You can read them without any software<p>2. Streamable row by row<p>3. Compress well<p>To be honest most of the points in this article could be addressed by standardizing a method of defining a schema for the CSVs. It could even be backward compatible by appending the definition as metadata on the header column or as a separate file.<p>One thing that would be good to have is a standardized method of <i>indexing</i> CSVs so that random access is possible too, though that would be more involved.

            Are there really new projects stretching the limits of CSV out in production?<p>Everyone knows it’s not capable of storing anything more than table data. It was never meant to be much more.<p>It doesn’t really store objects well. To write the values of a composite object would require following some format order. It would go past human readability and just be a bloated way of writing bytes with readable characters.

            Literally there are two characters required to create a csv. Anything that replaces it will necessarily be more complex. So let’s keep csv and create something better at the same time.

            Meh. Author probably messed up some important deadline or emailed (or got emailed) some crappy CSV file and then threw a temper tantrum and decided to write this.<p>Every single one of their points are extremely subjective and very wrong. If you have an excel sheet full of equations and colorful cells and then to decide to export it as CSV and open it in Notepad, you really can&#x27;t complain that that CSV is bad. I mean it&#x27;s obvious that to each format a set of strengths and a set of weaknesses, and also obviously what could be a strength to someone is a weakness to someone else. The fact that CSV is so simple to parse (almost every modern language can very easily read&#x2F;write a CSV) makes it a fantastic data transfer format for every single usecase I had (this doesn&#x27;t mean that other formats are less important of course). Sure you&#x27;ll lose your Google Sheet or Excel metadata, but this is NOT what CSV is for.<p>What I find fascinating though is that the author decided it&#x27;s a good idea to make a blanket statement like &quot;Time to retire?&quot; just because they themselves have an issue with SOME use case. I mean the idea that having your personal needs not met to justify arguing that we should ALL stop using CSV is so very bizarre to me, like it&#x27;s way beyond selfish.

            There are better formats but the change needs to come from the top down, I can&#x27;t see it working from the grass roots. Put it this way, I&#x27;m not going to turn around and refuse a non-technical client who volunteers at a non-profit because they can only give me data in Excel rather than whatever I decide the superior format is, or tell them it&#x27;s impossible when the next developer will click a few buttons and have me taken for a fool, nor will I push hard to sell them up on a data mapping service or cloud pipeline if it&#x27;s well outside their needs or budget. Unlike topics like web accessibility that&#x27;s easy to argue on its morals and ethics, or mobile first that&#x27;s easy to argue based on market share and audience reach, refusing to work with an organisation&#x27;s data because you don&#x27;t like the very simple, very established format is a very tough sell. If Excel could natively export to JSON, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d ask for, or their custom-built website from the 00&#x27;s had a clean REST API, then it wouldn&#x27;t even be a discussion.<p>There are workarounds for sure; VB macros, unzip XSLX and parse the XML, write scripts to automate Excel-to-whatever using DCOM, or import into an intermediary service and re-export into the format de-jure, but that all takes time and costs money too, and often causes confusion when even spoken about. Asking for a CSV takes a couple of seconds and is easily understood by most people. Anyone experienced with importing &#x2F; manipulating CSV data can deal with the variance in delimiters and escape sequences without major issues. It&#x27;s a headache at times but easier than the alternative of alienating or confusing clients who are looking for a simple solution to whatever issue they have today.<p>On the other hand once the data is in the target system, if they&#x27;re still asking for CSV exports I do probe to ask why, and try and figure out if there&#x27;s a better way. Reporting is the usual reason, and plenty of the CRMs I work with have built-in reporting that can replicate and improve upon whatever spreadsheet they are using, and have APIs that can interface with cloud-based reporting services. But there&#x27;s a lot of inertia against change in most small-to-medium organisations, not everyone is a data expert and you can&#x27;t sell someone something they can&#x27;t use or understand. Ultimately people win, and the solution ends up being a balance of hopefully incremental technological improvements that they can still integrate into their day-to-day. Not every organisation is able to undergo a full digital transformation with time, budgets, and skills at hand.<p>I agree with the sentiment but I&#x27;d hate to see a future where everyone&#x27;s locked into proprietary ecosystems - not that that is what&#x27;s advocated for in the post, but we have CSV because that&#x27;s what the big platforms seem to allow, not because they don&#x27;t know there are better options. There&#x27;s no technical reason Excel couldn&#x27;t export to WordPress or SuiteCRM. Take CSV away and it gets harder, not easier, to move between platforms.

            When I worked at Amazon, I had a t-shirt and bumper sticker made up that said &quot;Show me again on the doll where CSV hurt you.&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t remember a time that such a simple file format had such wild inconsistencies. Not to mention some CSV export functions just ignore them. Put a comma inside a CSV field? why not? Put a single double quote in a CSV field? sure! Insist that leading (or trailing) spaces in a CSV field are semantically important? OF COURSE!<p>If CSV was used consistently, it wouldn&#x27;t be <i>that</i> bad. But it&#x27;s apparently simplicity lulls developers into a false sense of security, which is part of what the original author seems to be saying.
