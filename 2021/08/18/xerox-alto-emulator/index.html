            People talking about the Xerox Star are <i>mostly</i> correct, but the statement that &quot;by that time most of the PARC researchers had long since left Xerox&quot; is quite wrong. Star was announced April 1981, and a couple PARC guys (Belleville, Tesler) had left or would soon, but it was certainly not &quot;long since.&quot;<p>I just gave a talk at the Vintage Computer Federation West about a week ago, about my book [1]. There&#x27;s a photo of a guy playing MazeWar on the cover, and it was taken November 2020 on a working Alto (restored by a guy from the Living Computer Museum, actually!)<p>I was part of Star, and I wrote the book as a novel mainly so you could see how something like that happens. None of the characters have hindsight, which is a flaw with most histories. And they have real lives outside of Xerox.<p>We did run XDE on our Altos. It was written entirely in Mesa.<p>[1] www.albertcory.io

            I so rarely get to bring this up, but here&#x27;s picture of my mom and her Star workstation circa 1983 or so: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;honeypot.net&#x2F;images&#x2F;mom-and-star.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;honeypot.net&#x2F;images&#x2F;mom-and-star.jpg</a><p>She was Wire Chief for the Burlington Northern railroad, and they used that to manage all the systems that keep trains running.<p>As a side note, I&#x27;m always a little shocked when I learn of workplace sexism. When I was a kid, this is what I thought programmers looked like. I was happy to learn that I could be into computers, too.

            It&#x27;s a very different experience than I expected. When I think of the Alto I think of a windowing operating system but this boots into a command line. I&#x27;ve tried out most of the available disks but haven&#x27;t yet found one that feels like a predecessor to the Apple Lisa.<p>It&#x27;s a great project that is really well done, it&#x27;s the actual experience of the Alto that surprised.

            Welcome to the Alto - that is exactly how it worked. There&#x27;s no &quot;desktop environment&quot;, as they were just beginning to figure out how to make applications with windows, icons, mouse cursor, etc.  The closest to what you expected to see is probably the Smalltalk environment.<p>The other part of this is that it&#x27;s been dramatically overstated how much Apple &quot;took&quot; from Xerox.

            That BYTE issue is so incredibly fascinating. Thanks a lot for posting it. The in-depth interviews with Hertzfeld, Atkinson, Jobs, a diagram of the Mac&#x27;s memory map (page 40), a block diagram of the Mac hardware (page 36), etc.

            You are likely thinking of the Xerox Star aka the Dandelion which was a product of Xerox Business Systems (a spinoff from the PARC work). I didn&#x27;t look too closely but if one of the packs has XDE on it (the Xerox Development Environment) then you&#x27;ll get the same windows experience that was demonstrated to Steve Jobs back in the day. I&#x27;m pretty sure you could run XDE on the Alto (my wife worked at XBS while I was at Sun and there was a lot of cross mingling of technical people at various social events but my memories of exactly what the Alto was capable of are more limited.) We had a get together once over at the office and booted mazewar on six or seven Altos and that was a lot of fun.

            The Xerox Star is the machine that had a direct influence on the look of the Lisa software.<p>The Star was Xerox&#x27;s big swing to try and enter the exploding business computer market.<p>Xerox assembled a huge team of software engineers to build a networked office system based on the initial research from PARC, but by that time most of the PARC researchers had long since left Xerox to join the rest of the industry.<p>The Star was the result of that effort, released the same year as the IBM PC, but it was a flop.<p>The Star and the Lisa were similar in that they&#x27;re both the opposite of the &quot;start small, do one thing really well, and iterate&quot; methodology.  Both were impressive in the long list of features they tried to introduce all at once, and both ended up as not very good systems.

            I didn&#x27;t realize that Star and PC were released together - what a contrast!  Unfortunately the Star was too closed and too expensive to succeed, but it also doesn&#x27;t seem that Xerox had the culture to do it any other way.<p>Xerox continued being active in this field for a long time and showcased some amazing work on visualizing and navigating ordered graphs with 3D graphics (can&#x27;t find the article I&#x27;m afraid) which were way ahead of the time.

            I&#x27;m not sure about the Xerox Star being &quot;too closed&quot; to succeed; I believe it incorporated Ethernet networking (another PARC innovation).<p>Upon release, the IBM PC was not PC compatible, as the not-quite-ISA was 8 bits, only a single interrupt controller, the power connector was not ATX (neither was the motherboard). Nobody&#x27;s monitor was multisync...<p>Compatibility wasn&#x27;t a thing.<p>(So ironic, it must have been intentional: the BYTE issue featuring &quot;Standards&quot; as the theme has the Apple Lisa and Apple II on the cover:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;byte-magazine-1983-02" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;byte-magazine-1983-02</a>

            How do you mean that? The IBM PC was not “PC compatible” because it defined what “PC compatible” meant. The 8bit bus it had is what became ISA, ATX was the successor to AT, which came from the IBM “Advanced Technology” PC, in a sense the grandchild of the original IBM PC (with the XT in between).<p>I feel like there is a meaning to your comment that I’m missing, do you mean that the PC wasn’t compatible to <i>anything</i>, because it was what defined compatibility, and still it was successful (because everyone copied it, hence “compatible”)?

            Sorry for being confusing.. I have been digging in and refreshing my memories of that first and second wave of small computers in the early 1980s.<p>It&#x27;s a bit churlish to knock the IBM PC, the box that launched a thousand clones. The computer came with BIOS listings and schematics of the motherboard!<p>It&#x27;s just that, as built, that first incarnation of the IBM PC was a kludge. A brilliant kludge, but in truth a hack designed to be replaced in a year or two. At the time, there were very low expectations regarding &quot;open&quot; versus &quot;closed&quot; systems. At least in my group of computer ah, enthusiasts. Rather than an S-100 passive backplane, where you can swap out all modules, you had storage and video display in one smaller box. With the printer, a RAM card, and the floppy controller, you had two or three slots...<p>High end video display terminals in 1980 could be expanded by installing big cards into a rack behind the CRT display. Then they could run with all processing locally!

            The IBM 5150 Personal Computer isn&#x27;t the same beast that we refer to as &quot;PC compatible&quot;.<p>It was a barely-16-bit computer, no protected mode, funky connectors for the keyboard (no mouse, of course), the interrupt vectors were wired up wrong... the joystick ports... no real-time clock, system configured with DIP switches instead of BIOS, floppy drives were you could buy it without floppy disks, boot directly from ROM into Microsoft BASIC and just use the cassette recorder as mass storage, the power supply was underpowered, the expansion cards were only 8-bit (in part because the 8088 CPU I&#x2F;O was only 8-bit)...<p>IBM got from a design to actual product in the retail channel in some ludicrously short period of time, like nine months for this baby computer.<p>The &quot;PC&quot; converged onto a set of standards. But if you manage to bring home an original IBM PC, you might be surprised at some of the work you will need to get it up and running.

            You&#x27;re thinking of the Xerox Star, not the Alto. An Alto running Smalltalk had a windowing environment, but not what you&#x27;re used to. The Star had a full WIMP system with desktop metaphor, also not one you&#x27;d be used to but very powerful and intuitive.

did something strange-I studied with TV

a lab that was mostly for grad students, but
they let me in. For computers back then,
they had Xerox Altos, which later inspired
the Macintosh, and I&#x27;d write games while
watching 1V. I&#x27;d write my own games,
and I created my own versions of Defender and Missile Command as an exercise.
My Macintosh versions of those two
games are still out there, free on the public domain. Missile Command&#x27;s actually
not too bad - it teaches valuable lessons
about survivability in a nuclear holocaust.&quot;

            Oh wow, you hit on a <i>major</i> topic in my book [1]. The Altos were all networked, via 3 MB Ethernet. MazeWar was a networked game (or &quot;MMOG&quot; in modern parlance) and it&#x27;s on the cover of the book. In the book they spend quite a bit of time talking (and trashing, for some old school folks) how Ethernet worked.<p>I actually don&#x27;t remember any live chat apps, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there weren&#x27;t any; there probably were.
