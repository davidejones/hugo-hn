            One of the things that bothers me about modern Google search results is that I can&#x27;t be sure the other person I&#x27;m telling to google something will even see the same results as me. Results change over time, sure, but google can&#x27;t help but try and tailor results.

            I&#x27;m similarly bothered by rolling updates of any software.  If something changes, there&#x27;s no version number to see what documentation is applicable.  There&#x27;s no way to test on a different computer to see if it&#x27;s my local environment.  There&#x27;s no way to roll back to a previous version to see if one of them broke.<p>I understand the advantages of A&#x2F;B testing from a development side, but it makes for a miserable user experience.

            I don&#x27;t think it matters with knowledge cards - the system is so fuzzy that it&#x27;ll throw up that answer to almost anything.<p>Apparently Louis Armstrong, the legendary jazz musician, was there with Neil Armstrong on the Moon in July 1969 as the oldest astronaut in history, a few years before his death at the age of 69.

            I&#x27;m not necessarily asking you, but I&#x27;m taking your message as an opportunity to ask if anyone knows of an extension that does the opposite?<p>I have pretty bad astigmatism, and I cannot read pages with dark background. There used to be an extension I used for this purpose, but it stopped working several years ago, and I have suffered ever since. Going into developer mode to play around with the stylesheet works, but is a huge hassle.

            Despite its name, that same extension does exactly that, I believe.<p>Actually, it has a switcher that lets you choose to darken or enlighten the webpages you read.<p>Honestly, I never understood why they had that option, but now I get it.

            For future visitors after Google fixes the bug: at this time, Google gave the same response that you would expect if the query mentioned Earth’s moon instead of Mars. This is also probably true if you ask Google the same question as an “Okay, Google” search. It’s a big info box that says when the moon landing was, shows a photo of an astronaut on the moon, and so on.<p>Edit: corrected, thanks :)

            Regardless of what it ought to say, I see the same effect with the destinations “earth”, “saturn”, “america”, “russia”, “newton”, “silver”, and “lego”, though the date varies from the 16th to the 20th.

            Seems silly - not quite running, but consider that Europeans forgot how to swim efficiently and really only had the doggy paddle until they observed native Americans doing the front crawl.

            The linked article doesn&#x27;t say anything about native Americans, and in terms of substantive data it seems to jump in history from the 4th century prevalence of Roman bathhouses, to 16th century local bans on swimming, filling in the gaps (which account for the entire premise of the article) with speculation about bridges and mermaids.<p>It immediately follows the description of those swimming bans with other 16th century examples of Tudor scholars endorsing and writing guides on swimming, resulting in an article that&#x27;s an interesting read but with a poorly supported thesis.

            It would be more charitable to say that current ML&#x2F;NLP approaches have orders of magnitude less understanding than humans. The ML&#x2F;NLP process just jumps straight to the correlated answer, which a human would do, but then use higher order reasoning - &quot;wait mars? that wasn&#x27;t where he set foot&quot;.<p>This to me is similar to current autonomous driving limitations.  The cars can only respond to situations they have seen before. Any novel elements lead to failure, where a human can fall back on higher order reasoning: &quot;That is a stoplight yes, but it is on the back of a truck, ignore it&quot; (real example)

            If you ask the average American “When did Niel Gaiman set foot on the moon?” Most would answer that they don’t know exactly but think it was in the 60’s.<p>This is not a limitation of AI, it’s exactly what you want it to do.

            I dont think comparing yourself to an average idiot on the street is what google should strive for.<p>The way it used to work you had one intelligent entity forming a query and a machine performing said query. Somewhere along the line Google got this idea returning no result was a bad outcome and started overriding queries. Its like you go to the hardware store and ask for nails, but shopkeeper starts telling you all about nail saloons in the vicinity because they ran out of finishing nails - or worse, goes nail saloon -&gt; spa -&gt; finishing -&gt; ending -&gt; happy ending.<p>We went from intelligent entity forming a query and a machine performing said query to idiot computer treating you line an idiot.

            &gt; Most would answer that they don’t know exactly but think it was in the 60’s.<p>I think this is an important point.  Humans and Google have a similar bias (for different reasons) that they want to be helpful or seem knowledgeable when asked a question, so won&#x27;t say &quot;I am confused by that question&quot; and will rather give an answer to a question which is similar to a question that they can understand, in the hopes that it is approximately right.<p>In the case of asking when Neil Armstrong landed on Mars, guessing &quot;I think it was in the 60&#x27;s&quot; is accurate to within 10 years but off by 56 million km.

            In a school where I studied, something similar was used as a trick question during a history exam. &quot;Which language Vladimir Lenin used to write correspondence addressed to Karl Marx?&quot; or something like that. Nearly half of the class failed on this. To those unaware: Lenin discovered Marx&#x27;s book, Capital, in 1887, while Marx died in 1883, so there could not be any correspondence.

            But at the same time, I think it&#x27;s doing a really good job of what it&#x27;s trying to do. Google search is not trying to be a repository for all the world&#x27;s information. It&#x27;s just trying to get people to what they&#x27;re 
 most likely looking for or show the most related things. Given the significance of the moon landing and the fact that no one has set foot on mars I find it unsurprising that it brings up info on the moon landing. It&#x27;s seems better to assume what the user is likely looking for especially when (at least my) Google searches often take the form of &quot;moon land neil year&quot;. I can just type things like that out, stream of consciousness, and the majority of the time I get what I&#x27;m looking for immediately.

            There&#x27;s a few issues here.<p>The first is that Google has specifically chosen to call out an answer in some kind. If the query is reasonably framed as a question, there is a <i>clear</i> indication in the UI that the response is meant to be an answer to that question.<p>Now it&#x27;s definitely the case that a lot of questions have some amount of semantic ambiguity that a listener would have to resolve. For example, a question about a &quot;president&quot; can reasonably be inferred to mean specifically a &quot;US president&quot; of some kind, at least if the query is from the US and is in English.<p>And sometimes people can ask questions where there&#x27;s a confused detail. And responding with the question they probably meant to ask is not unreasonable.<p>However--and this is a big however--it is incumbent to emphasize that the answer is for a <i>different</i> question than the one that was literally asked. You see this when you do searches of misspelled terms: &quot;did you mean <i>this</i> one instead?&quot; Because occasionally, no, you did mean the term that has much fewer results.<p>And this kind of emphasize-the-answer can have poor results sometimes. Ask Google which president became supreme dictator. The answer makes it clear why it thinks that, but... that&#x27;s a <i>really</i> different question from the one that was asked.

            &gt; isn&#x27;t really any level of &#x27;comprehension&#x27; at all.<p>I mean, that&#x27;s a bit harsh. I bet there are lots of people who would answer the question the exact same way.

            While I agree that &quot;no comprehension at all&quot; seems harsh, I don&#x27;t think anyone would jumble things up between moon and mars unless they got the fact wrong in the first place.<p>These knowledge cards are pretty useful, but they shouldn&#x27;t be taken as the source of fact (at least right now) unless one opens the link to check where that card is extracted from.

            More specifically, you can get a human to answer like this, but that&#x27;s when the <i>human</i> doesn&#x27;t comprehend the question properly<p>I mean, you probably could get people to answer 1969 for when Neil Armstrong set foot on the poop, but only if they didn&#x27;t understand the word &quot;poop&quot;

            Yes, but a human who don&#x27;t understand a word lacks the vocabulary for that specific language and that&#x27;s the reason they cannot understand or comprehend the question properly. Whereas Google Search does have the vocabulary built in with its data set. The problem here is it didn&#x27;t piece the words together correctly even though the question is valid.<p>It is one thing to not understand a word in the first place and another if you cannot piece it together i.e. assuming you know the language.

            I agree, but it is a type of failure of comprehension (Google Search doesn&#x27;t understand the word &quot;poop&quot; either, it&#x27;s just aware that it crops up in a lot of contexts and can rote-recall multiple definitions for it).  Same with the human giving a date for Nixon landing on the moon because they understand moon landings but have no comprehension of who Nixon was (much like Google, which additionally has the unhelpful correlation between mentions of Nixon and mentions of moon landings to factor in)

            But in human&#x27;s case, the lack of understanding of word Nixon is because they didn&#x27;t know what that means in the first place and they don&#x27;t have data to know or cross check what that word means. On the other hand, Google Search does have an access to the data (just strings in this case from an article) which it has to verify based on the user&#x27;s query and then display it as the knowledge card and yet it couldn&#x27;t because... (I don&#x27;t know why exactly).

            That isn&#x27;t the question of your comprehension though. You got the input (question) wrong because of your habit and not because you couldn&#x27;t comprehend the sentence structure. You misread the sentence and that&#x27;s why you got confused over what is wrong if I get it properly. You most probably wouldn&#x27;t have done this if you read it as Mars in the first place.

            A fun one I tried was &quot;Which president became supreme dictator&quot; that answered &quot;William Howard Taft.&quot; It took some finessing to get it (I originally started with &quot;dictator for life&quot;), but it&#x27;s clear that it picked up only &quot;supreme&quot; and &quot;president&quot; in the query to guess that you meant to ask which president became a Supreme Court justice.

            The last one actually is an example of the ambiguity of language. For example, if you asked this from a person, answers like “sponge”, “mollusk” and “flatworm” probably aren’t what you’re really considering and you might think the other person is being too pedantic. So really you want nuance from the AI like “if you meant all animals, X. If you meant all land animals, Y. If you meant mammals, Z”. Human are very ambiguous with categories because all categories are arbitrary human classifications and dealing with that ambiguity is difficult even for humans.

            The problem isn&#x27;t so much the answers, but how they are framed.<p>In the case of Neil Armstrong, the failure is to state that the answer is for a Moon landing. That would allow the person making the query to realize that the answer was not what they were looking for. In this case it is because Armstrong never landed on Mars. In other cases it may be because the question or data were incorrect.<p>The current Tom Hanks answer is closer to what should have been done in this regard since it refers to the film directly, though it remains problematic in that it highlights the year to such a degree that the person making the query may ignore the context. (It is also problematic because the film is about a mission that didn&#x27;t land on the Moon, which could only be determined through further research. Granted, that is more along the lines of your slowest animal example.)

In the scientific sense, sure, pretty much everything living that is not a plant is an animal, but I think most people don&#x27;t think of worms when they think of animals.<p>You can say, &quot;well that&#x27;s wrong&quot;, but that&#x27;s kinda missing the point.  Categories are somewhat arbitrary, and word usage can differ greatly from the scientific or dictionary definition when we&#x27;re talking about colloquial usage.

            As someone who is building such instant answer system for our own web search engine [1] the level of failure here tells me that this is:<p>- Either a basic, distilled BERT based model (optimized for latency and scale) or<p>- More likely, still a purely heuristics driven answers system like the one Google has been using for last 10+ years.<p>The current NLP models are able to quite successfully answer these questions with proper context. In this case ignoring Lance or Mars in question looks more like old-school keyword based heuristics and there is no way it can get this right.<p>Google is not only allowing mistakes in this, what is considered a fairly difficult problem to solve, but also questions that directly query their own knowledge graph, for example this one querying for a CEO of a well known public company where it returns the wrong answer [2]<p>This only shows that &#x27;emperor has no clothes&#x27; [3] and that there is still a lot of room for innovation left, specially on the &#x27;organizing the world&#x27;s information&#x27; front.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kagi.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kagi.com</a> (currently in private beta)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;qkXpdFB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;qkXpdFB</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Is-Google-really-in-a-decline" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Is-Google-really-in-a-decline</a> (almost 2M views for the top answer indicate that &#x27;Is Google in decline&quot; is a fairly popular question among presumably Google users)

            Interesting.

            Yeah the fact that *this* is what the mighty Google just let loose upon the world shows that they don&#x27;t really care any more about their users, their products and their supposed mission of organizing the worlds&#x27; information.<p>The fix is quite easy too, just have an AI driven system with human supervision, I think at this point it is well known that a human + AI will basically always trump an AI and it&#x27;s not like google doesn&#x27;t have the resources to pull this off. You could build a database of verified facts that are often googled, have the AI gather data, have humans do a sanity check.<p>It&#x27;s probably just some scheme to get someone promoted inside Google, the infobox is a side-effect of someone&#x27;s career plan, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it actually works as long as it hits some key metric that gets used in an evaluation somewhere, who cares about propagating misinformation and falsehoods google is still making money.

            Ask Google how tall Elon Musk is. You will get 188 cm and conversion of 5 foot 10 inches which is way off. Two websites in the results that feed Google have the conversion wrong. Bad data is all over the place and copied over and over even simple incorrect conversions.
