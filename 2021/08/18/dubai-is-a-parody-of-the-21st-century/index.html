            I the thing that I was surprised the most to hear was that those skyscrapers sewage is carried by trucks outside Dubai and dumped who knows where. I&#x27;ve heard of slavery stories before and am surprised they still get any new workers recruited, the stories I&#x27;ve heard are horrific. This is a  place I will never visit, even if the trip is all paid for by someone else.

            The problem is, the municipal sewer system has inadequate capacity to receive any of the poop, so while the sewers are being upgraded, the poop is hauled away by trucks.

            Worth noting that this guy&#x27;s channel is overly dismissive of everyone, sometimes strawmanning, and a bit nihilist. That said, Dubai turned to an unmitigated disaster of a real estate excess which will disintegrate in the sand from which it came unless its owners do something completely drastic.

            There are things and people he is for -- he isn&#x27;t dismissive of everyone and everything. For example, he is a fan of traditional rail and subway systems and thinks we should build more of them. What he is dismissive of (and I think with reason) are things like the hyperloop, which he suspects not only are unworkable, but are promoted precisely to avoid investing in proven infrastructure like trains and subways and instead waiting for this miracle technology that will be ready &quot;any day now&quot;.

            The argument made is more about the infeasibility and uncompetitiveness of hyperloop as a system.<p>As for the &quot;Any day now&quot;, it&#x27;s been in development for centuries and the deadline moved from late 2010&#x27;s to early 2020&#x27;s and now it&#x27;s once again in the late 2020&#x27;s.

            He doesn’t like maglev either because it’s extremely expensive compared to high speed rail and cites the Shanghai airports operating loss as an example. It also has similar infrastructure requirements as a monorail: a more complex platform than traditional rail.

            I remember reading a reddit retort from an expat who lived in Dubai when someone asked him why he lived in a slave state; he said something along the lines of the West also uses slave labor, who makes your electronics (or mines the minerals for them?), your clothes (probably poorly paid Bangladeshi). The difference is distance, in the Emirate countries the distance to the slave is a lot shorter...

            People who go on about slavery in Dubai are people who have never visited either Dubai nor the places where it’s labourers come from.<p>Nobody is forced to go work in the UAE, UAE has very strict and well enforced labour rules.<p>Everyone talks about UAE employers supposedly taking employees passports, but when I was applying for my visa I was told countless times to never give my passport to my employer and to call ministry of labour should they ask.

            Why isn&#x27;t it a legitimate argument? It&#x27;s true, isn&#x27;t it? People like to accuse others of bad behavior because they think they&#x27;re pious (speaking of &quot;arrogant&quot;...), but they themselves are ignorant of theirs.<p>If the people complaining are ethical consumers, then...

            So you support having Slaves in your own country too? You cannot immediately force ANOTHER country to stop with that, but you can stop it in your own, that&#x27;s the difference, and you should not support a country who openly use humans like that.<p>But yes you have a point, for example the FIFA (HQ in Switzerland) knew how bad the working conditions for the WM in Qatar where and gave a shi* about it (~6500 death)

            Ha, are you for real?<p>&quot;i[s] your consumption slave-free&quot;<p>&quot;No, but...&quot;.<p>So, just like me and the redditor in Dubai, you know this slavery is going on, but you&#x27;re not that bothered with it. The excuse of &quot;there&#x27;s a border between the slave and me&quot; is not valid. If you want to berate others for being shitty, you can&#x27;t excuse your own behavior by making up your own rules like this border.<p>I mentioned the redditor to make people reflect on their own abusive behavior towards other humans, IMO some people like to berate others to make themselves feel superior (&quot;I don&#x27;t do that evil stuff, so I&#x27;m a better person.&quot;), but hey, look in the mirror, maybe they should realize they&#x27;re enjoying the fruits of slave labor as well, and they need to change themselves too.

            Having slaves IN your country IS something you can change, having slaves in other country&#x27;s is not (or just very slow ATM). That expat has a disgusting mindset if you ask me.<p>But having said that, Spain&#x2F;Italy and the USA has their Modern-Slaves too, you don&#x27;t have to go as far as bangladesh.

            the gulf states are a weird place to be. For the most part it really does have a complete fakeness to it. Being there feels exactly like what it is, a bunch of autocratic new money building itself status symbols. However I would call it more 20th century than 21st century, because all the aesthetics are like someone watched to many Western sci-fi movies of the 60s, 70s and 80s like Blade Runner and then decided to build exactly that because it looked cool, weirdly retro-futuristic.<p>It&#x27;s also often weird in a way that it tries to blend local and traditional culture with its material excess, but in a way you would expect from someone at the other end of the world who doesn&#x27;t actually know anything about it.
