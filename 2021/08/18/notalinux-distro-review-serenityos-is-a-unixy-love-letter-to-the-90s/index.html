            What begs to emerge in the SerenityOS world is a form-centric visual RAD IDE like Delphi&#x2F;VisualBasic&#x2F;VisualStudio-WinForms. Powered by a higher-level (than C++) language preferably. And high-level (automatic memory management, first-class Unicode strings) languages don&#x27;t have to be heavy, VisualBasic did quite well on 486s. But I don&#x27;t actually mind C++, I enjoyed Borland C++ Builder (a Delphi clone I used because I never learned Pascal) and QNX PhAB and had no problem with C++ (but I didn&#x27;t really enjoy MS VisualC++ MFC which required you to code the UI manually).<p>I hope the actual GUI toolkit is engineered with potential support for visual designers in mind.<p>It is also interesting to note how well do legacy Windows controls integrate with the system so old Windows apps running on modern Windows versions enjoy seamless support of modern user IO facilities which didn&#x27;t exist when they were born (autocompletion, spell checking, dictation, screen reading, etc).

            Lazarus is rather cool but even after you learn Pascal (which is rather alien to modern programming) the built-in not-so-smart code editor feels somewhat painful to use after VisualStudio and IntelliJ. These 2 entry barriers make it feel overly vintage and demotivate from using it.<p>As for Electron - the idea of learning the web front-end stack and designing UIs from scratch (rather than composing them from common controls), just to produce insanely heavyweight executables compatible with a limited set of platforms (e.g. Lazarus is much more cross-platform, it can even run on Haiku) doesn&#x27;t sound inspirational at all.

            &gt; What is missing from Lazarus&#x27; editor?<p>Perhaps it actually is good, I probably just didn&#x27;t dedicate enough time to discover all its features. Or maybe all the cool stuff was added right after I tried it (it&#x27;s been some years already). I mostly mean context-aware completion suggestions, refactoring and code navigation. I already can&#x27;t remember what exactly was missing (I didn&#x27;t find) when I tried.<p>&gt; I never used IntelliJ but from my experience with Visual Studio<p>VisualStudio + ReSharper ≈ IntelliJ.

            Lazarus had what i describe for at least a decade. However one thing that might happen is that you didn&#x27;t notice them because some of the functionality is under different shortcut keys.<p>For example Ctrl+Space will do context aware completion (e.g. will put similar types to the context near the top) but other forms of code completion, like automatic variable declarations, creating definitions in implementation section for for declarations in the interface section, etc are done with Ctrl+Shift+C. It has a bunch of different shortcut keys for different stuff and you need to go through both the main menu (Source menu mainly) and the context menu (Refactor and Source) to find them. Also some of the default settings aren&#x27;t ideal (IMO), so you may want to check the Codetools category in the options that controls some of Lazarus&#x27; behavior there.

&gt; The closest that i can think of is Lazarus for FreePascal: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazarus-ide.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazarus-ide.org&#x2F;</a><p>Well, Lazarus is exactly what you are asking for. Its GUI designer is leaps and bounds ahead pretty much every other GUI designer for desktop applications and the IDE integration with the underlying framework is second to none. The project isn&#x27;t only under active development but has more developers than it ever had.<p>The WinForms you mentioned feels like some abandoned beta that barely provides Delphi 1 level functionality in terms of &quot;RAD-ness&quot; and other frameworks abandon the entire RAD idea altogether, regressing back to glorified resource editors like you&#x27;d see in 16bit Windows back in 80s.

            IntelliJ includes a Swing builder (and is itself written with Swing).<p>The product that I miss for little SMB projects is Access. It was the best option for building single-user CRUD apps with a really thoughtful bundle of features. (It totally fell over with multi-user, and every user needed a license for the runtime (with some exceptions) and VBA had some major warts, but in terms of DX it was great)

It was the best option for building single-user CRUD apps with a really thoughtful bundle of features.<p>Try Gupta Team Developer. It&#x27;s an SQL-centric binding-driven visual RAD tool where you draw the controls visually and basically bind them to SQL queries. It was pleasure and fun to use the last time I tried. To me it felt way better than Access.

            I know and that&#x27;s why I ask. I mean I would like to configure an existing pre-built non-free Swing app (a JetBrains IDE) to use the default Swing PLAF (the PLAF NetBeans used the last time I tried it) instead of the one the original developer has bundled.

            IIRC Glade was just a standalone UI designer (not an IDE), wasn&#x27;t it? I actually tried QtDesigner + PyCharm and liked both but lack of the integration feels itchy. Very usable but not nearly as pleasant as VisualStudio with WinForms.

            As I remember it, Glade would output an XML document structure representing the UI which could then be loaded via libgtk. It seemed like a nicer model than code generation, though I don&#x27;t remember much about how it worked.

            &gt; As I remember it, Glade would output an XML document structure representing the UI which could then be loaded<p>QtDesigner does exactly this for Qt (and you have to run a command to generate the Python code from the XML then). Good enough, better than nothing but still not an actual IDE where you can just click on the button you drawn and jump to the code seamlessly or select a function you already wrote to be an event handler right in a control properties window.<p>This adds an extra step of actually &quot;building&quot; the UI which prevents you from changing things on the fly.<p>This may sound unimportant but when you have it the actually integrated way like in the VisualStudio WinForms Designer, building an app actually feels like painting with Bob Ross - satisfying and productive. And doing the UI and the code in different apps feels like having separate kitchens (rooms) for cutting the food and for roasting it.<p>In fact I imagine my ideal app dev tool as cross-platform VisualStudio WinForms with WPF-like bindings and programmed in F#. Oh boy that could be a pleasure I would pay some month salaries of mine to get.

            On a side track, MFC C++ is the best offer current on MS stack for C++, as rediculous as it may seem.<p>They introduced a C++ Builder like with C++&#x2F;CX for WinRT, but apparently too many people inside Redmond wasn&#x27;t happy to have it around, so now you get to use its replacement (C++&#x2F;WinRT) as back on Visual C++ 6.0 and ATL.<p>Pity that C++ RAD tooling similar to C++ Builder is seen as not for real developers.<p>So the trend to write GUIs by hand on C++ is the only path known to many devs.

            There used to be a visual form builder. Nobody used it to build applications, so it was eventually removed. Nowadays, GUI stuff for most applications are written in the GML language, which is Serenity-specific. You can look through the source code to see examples.

            I built it, believing it was going to be useful. In the end, it was not. There&#x27;s no point in keeping unused features around, since the system is just for ourselves.<p>Since then, we&#x27;ve built a markup language for interface design (GML) which has made GUI development significantly easier, so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re focusing on instead. If someone wants to build a visual design tool on top of GML, they are obviously free to do so, but as with everything else in SerenityOS, people work on what they themselves are interested in. :)

            The other link posted here is great info but might be a bit overwhelming. Some of the highlights of modern C++ to look into:<p>Lambda functions<p>Smart pointers = less need for *<p>Move semantics = less need for pointers, efficient pass&#x2F;return-by-value<p>Type inference with `auto`<p>`nullptr` = strongly-typed null pointer type sans macros<p>`constexpr` = compile-time programming sans macros<p>Deleted functions = can prevent things like accidental copies<p>Range-based `for` = very similar to Java&#x27;s for-each<p>That should mostly catch you up from C++03 to C++11-ish (language features only; there&#x27;s plenty more to explore with library changes). C++14 and 17 had some refinements to those items so review the above in a current context for additional enhancements to them. C++20 adds some major things like concepts and modules, but starting there might not be the best idea to get up to speed.<p>(I&#x27;m a C++ amateur and hobbyist, so I might not be using 100% correct terms above! I&#x27;m also a very, very minor SerenityOS contributor.)

            I was in a similar situation to yours when work required me to become a C++17 expert practically overnight.<p>Bjarne (inventor of the language) has a &quot;blue book&quot; that is very good and pretty comprehensive (if a bit dry and academic). I read it cover to cover in a couple days - not really retaining everything but learning what I didn&#x27;t know. Then I read Scott Meyers&#x27;s Effective Modern C++ to get up to date on the latest thinking and really nail down some of the finer points.<p>YMMV but this worked well for me to get a good feel for C++ the language. Mastering the STL and&#x2F;or Boost is a journeyman job, though, as is mastering (any) build system. Of course there is no substitute for firing up the editor and writing real code.

            &gt; I think the objective of the author is not to make the most complete, fastest, shiniest OS ever, but have something that works, that&#x27;s usable<p>There already are enough of OSes which work and are usable. To me it seems the goal here is just beauty in all the possible aspects.

            I&#x27;m indeed working on it (meta-issue progress tracking is over there: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8605" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8605</a>). However, bootstrapping pkgsrc is a stressful test of reliability, stability and POSIX-compliance for any operating system, let alone a hobbyist one. I&#x27;ve yet to have a pkgsrc bootstrap finish successfully without hitting a bug, deadlock, coredump, kernel panic or some combination thereof. It&#x27;s like repeatedly stubbing one&#x27;s toe on a sharp POSIX edge.<p>That&#x27;s not counting actually building packages inside SerenityOS (pkgsrc doesn&#x27;t support the kind of cross-compilation we&#x27;d need to build packages on a Linux host for a SerenityOS target), which will probably expose lots of other bugs, race conditions and limitations.

            Not related, but related: I could definitely use a consistent, coherent, pixel-perfect Windows 95 theme package for Linux. QT, GTK, DE does not really matter, as long as they blend in properly. Something like the adapta-project.

            I also wouldn&#x27;t mind (and would certainly donate to) a &quot;consistent, coherent, pixel-perfect&quot; (and also kept up-to-date to be easily installable on recent distros, covering Qt, GTK and GTK3) themes imitating the actual SerenityOS, as well as Windows 98 (not a radical Windows 95 fan), Windows XP, Windows Vista (it was shitty but pretty), MacOS 9.2, QNX6 Photon, Haiku and Swing[1]. Perhaps even Windows 3.11 (OMG I loved its Control Panel icons). And I&#x27;ve once seen a picture some other exotic retro UI which I found beautiful but I could never find it again and don&#x27;t know which platform it was (I thought it was some modern Amiga but apparently it wasn&#x27;t, some sort of Unix perhaps, but no Unix screenshots I found actually looked like that).<p>Needless to say the themes would have to be extended to accommodate the features of the relevant toolkits like GTK3 complex window titles and KDE&#x27;s optional always-on-top and always-on-bottom buttons (I actually want every stacking window manager to have these two, I use both of them a lot).<p>And I would also want these for Windows 10 (and 11 obviously), not just Linux. Themes for some actual apps (e.g. Firefox) also needed.<p>I wonder if there already is enough of aging millennials appreciating retro GUIs to form a market.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;cd&#x2F;E37069_01&#x2F;html&#x2F;E37073&#x2F;figures&#x2F;ide-profiling-tools.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;cd&#x2F;E37069_01&#x2F;html&#x2F;E37073&#x2F;figures&#x2F;ide...</a>

            My favourite ever OS theme was Mac OS X 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot;, that period of Aqua was just so cheerful and friendly compared to everything before or since.

            Those Chicago95 screenshots might be a bit out of date. Some of the systems I use have the latest Chicago95 on them, and it either doesn&#x27;t bother me, or I&#x27;m so focused on doing things in applications (or on anything but the UI theme) that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.

            Compiled and (admittedly briefly) tested yesterday. It&#x27;s small, and fast although run virtualized. There are some quirks here and there, but for an OS in its infancy it&#x27;s normal.
Not an easy task, however I&#x27;d like one day to see it ported to ARM platforms. All those small and cheap Pi-like boards or TV boxes seem just the right platforms for it.

            I&#x27;m impressed by everything about this project, but the idea of re-writing everything from scratch would seem to doom this project to obscurity. No?<p>How can any open-source project compete if it doesn&#x27;t lean on other open-source projects? Am I missing something?<p>This approach seems to guarantee that they can do a handful of things better than anyone else (because they control the whole stack), but not enough things to ever be truly complete OS for any given market segment.<p>Unless 1000 developers fall in love and choose to participate and compensate for the absence of other OS code, I don&#x27;t see how this can grow sustainably. I&#x27;d love to be wrong, though.

            Compete for what?<p>It&#x27;s an OS being build from scratch born from the desire to do it, and to have all things in it built from scratch.

            &quot;Hate&quot; seems a bit harsh. I started out by saying how much I love everything about the project.<p>If it&#x27;s not intended to gain mass adoption, then that&#x27;s fine. I see from some comments that it was started as a way to keep the original maker&#x27;s mind busy during recovery. I respect that. It doesn&#x27;t HAVE to be about gaining market share. But when I see a really cool project, it&#x27;s hard not to immediately look at what would prevent me from using it or what might prevent it from gaining mass adoption.<p>To your point about being annoyed by seeing this on hacker news... you do realize this is a forum maintained by a VC firm, right? This is kinda the place for discussing how new ideas in tech can grow and be disruptive to the market. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s the only thing we can discuss, but it seems weird of you to hate it when this topic comes up. It&#x27;s an underlying subtext to everything on HN. Am I wrong?

            This. Linux wasn’t made to compete, either. Nor was PHP. Or even Perl. Serenity hearkens to a time when people made — and shared — things out of passion and the drive to create and refine. It’s what drew me to software development in the first place — an internet-enabled open playground of passion, trial and error, learning, and making.

            It&#x27;s named &quot;serenity&quot; OS after the serenity prayer recited in AA meetings, because the developer started this as a way to keep his mind occupied to overcome alcoholism. I think it has been a wild success for that purpose and is one of the more beautiful examples of using software for the promotion of personal excellence rather than commercial excellence. Obscurity is not an impediment to accomplishing this goal.

            From what I understand, they <i>are</i> porting some established software like Qt and GCC, and presumably if there is enough interest and volunteers, more applications. However they also aim to write a core set of apps specially for Serenity from scratch, so it seems like the best of both worlds to me: a set of native, integrated programs designed to showcase the OS&#x27;s specialities, with ports of popular FOSS programs, and since Serenity does aim to be &quot;Unix-like&quot;, it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.<p>The incumbents in the field are absolutely overwhelming in their existing functionality, which makes it an extremely steep slope to climb for an upstart, unless they aim to fulfil a specialised niche. Linux struggled for years with lack of drivers. That&#x27;s always the one of the chief roadblocks. If the OS can drive a broad range of hardware, then automatically users and ports of software will happen, but if it can only recognise a few generic devices then it will remain hobbyist. But thanks to the complexity of modern hardware, the task of even <i>adapting</i> Linux&#x27;s drivers would be an enormous undertaking.

            &gt; Porting a modern browser like Firefox or Chromium to an entirely new operating system is arguably as difficult as writing one from scratch<p>Sadly this sounds quite obvious. But, out of curiosity, does it have to be? Let&#x27;s imagine we actually write a modern web browser from scratch. Can&#x27;t we design it the way it would be easy to port to other OSes because it would implement all the actual HTML and CSS features in a platform-independent logic layer on top of a portable renderer layer?<p>Remember how many platforms did the original Opera support back in the days. I remember running it natively on QNX. And it was the most modern and standard-compliant browser.

            I&#x27;ve taken a look at the screenshots and discovered the fact SerenityOS supports theming. This makes me want to share my opinion on this: big light elements in the dark theme (like the display frame in the display settings) and big dark elements in the light theme (like the terminal) are annoying (in addition dark terminal also can be very hard to read when the sun shines straight into your display). Although both of the examples I have given look this way because this is the classic way for them to look, I&#x27;d love to see an option to automatically style <i>everything</i> (the terminal specifically, the display settings decoration doesn&#x27;t matter much but it can also be fixed just to make it perfect) them in accordance with the system theme gamma.<p>In fact this is why I don&#x27;t use (on Linux and Windows) dark themes actually: because there are many apps which don&#x27;t support dark themes and look like huge white bulbs when your system is dark (and most of the apps which do support dark themes still require manual re-configuration every morning&#x2F;evening instead of just complying to the OS-level switch).

            I love the idea, and I love strong visions, but why not something closer to Motif&#x2F;CDE? In my mind at least, when I think of 90s workstations, I don&#x27;t think of Windows 95.

            More current-day developers are nostalgic for Windows 95&#x2F;NT than for Motif because of sheer exposure. It&#x27;s the same for me: Windows NT UIs have a vibe of &quot;good old days&quot; for me, whereas Motif UIs feel like ancient history that is unrelated to me personally.

            Motif would probably be a little too much. I always perceived Motif as the ugliest GUI toolkit I&#x27;ve ever seen. Now as I age I started to appreciate retro GUIs and began seeing some charm in Motif but it certainly requires some intentional &quot;will to love&quot;. Or maybe it is just an acquired taste like 
surströmming or something like that.<p>And someone related to the SCO Group can probably patent-troll you if you use it. There are no giants like RedHat and Novel to protect SerenityOS in such an event the way they protect Linux.

            I don&#x27;t know if you mentioned scrollbars as a rhetorical argument, or literally. But if the latter, then ... (queue rant) ...<p>What? Even scrollbars? Shows just how broken, regressive and anti-innovation the US Patent system is.<p>Its part of software legend how Jobs et al learned of these concepts through early exposure to Smalltalk. There are numerous videos of Jobs himself talking about it (with requisite amounts of awe). I&#x27;m sure most people here already know the history.<p>Theres even the interesting tale of how Jobs critiqued the scrolling (he prefered something smoother than line-by-line scrolling), and Dan Ingalls live coded a solution in a few minutes.<p>&quot;Prior art&quot; indeed :)

            Serenity is not really designed for everyday use, but more for enjoyment and as a learning experience for the developers.

            What kind of attitude is that? Why shouldn&#x27;t someone be proud of themselves, when they manage to implement a crypto library? It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re asking you or anyone else to use it with sensitive data and they&#x27;re not pretending it&#x27;s secure or on par with others.<p>The whole OS is a learning process for almost everyone involved and they have every right to feel proud of every little step they take. Like do you think the best in class crypto libraries out there just popped into existence or their authors wrote the perfect code on their first try? All of them were inferior wheels at one point, and all of them made mistakes and learned from them.

            Surely you could&#x27;ve expressed your concerns in a more constructive way?<p>In any case, according to their GitHub page, they use libtls, which is also apparently associated with OpenBSD.

            LibTLS is our own original code [1], it has nothing to do with OpenBSD (or any other library that happens to share the name.) :)<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Userland&#x2F;Libraries&#x2F;LibTLS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SerenityOS&#x2F;serenity&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Userland&#x2F;...</a>

            Oh, my mistake.  There also exists a libtls that is part of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.libressl.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.libressl.org&#x2F;</a> which is a fork of OpenSSL that is associated with OpenBSD, so it seemed like a reasonable assumption that they are the same.
