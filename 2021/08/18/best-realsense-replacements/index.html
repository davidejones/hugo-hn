            Incoming hearsay, but I&#x27;ve heard conflicting things from RealSense integrators on what Intel is actually doing with this product over the longer term. Someone mentioned that ongoing R&amp;D is being shuttered, but the depth camera product would still be available for purchase for a while. It would be nice to get some more clarity on what&#x27;s actually happening.

            This kind of makes sense as bigger customers would have to have some sort of availability contract. I guess we just have to wait for statements. Realsense cameras that are not being developed, but promised to be available for purchase for 5-10 years might still be better than anything else out there, or at least to bridge us through the chipageddon gap.  Does Realsense see the threat of 3D image sensors&#x2F;solid state&#x2F;flash LiDARs taking over and are bailing out early? I guess if this was the case why not just keep the L515 LiDAR?

            Intel is notorious for not giving reasonable EOL notices nor last-buy opportunities. I don’t trust them as a supplier. I would not make the assumption that customers were treated well. Until I hear from my contacts, I assume nothing. (Source: worked at Intel for 11 years. Later worked at customers that got gored by this practice a couple of times.)

            Makes sense, if you have a product where you can make a profit on the manufacturing, why would you stop supply. Intel never broke out Realsense in any public finical data, I wonder if the R&amp;D was not profitable, and is not a core part of Intel&#x27;s business so the new CEO decided to shut it down.

            AIRY3D has been developing a passive, single sensor depth solution that has lightweight power and compute requirements. With a single CMOS sensor you get both 2D and depth realtime streams. I work at AIRY3D and we have advanced prototypes with some samples available for eval&#x2F;purchase (limited supply). Definitely could be a replacement for RealSense for certain applications (eg under 1 meter range, and ideal for outdoors).

            I think depth cameras haven&#x27;t really taken off.<p>One issue is that,  with neural networks,  you can accomplish many things a depth camera can do without the depth camera.<p>For instance you can train a neural network to guess at a depth field for a scene.  It&#x27;s not going to deal with<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ames_room" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ames_room</a><p>but it is good enough for many purposes.  Similarly you can train a neural network to separate the speaker on a video call from the background,  so you just don&#x27;t need a depth camera.<p>On top of that people just haven&#x27;t found applications for depth cameras that are all that compelling.  I guess &quot;Windows Hello&quot; uses something like a depth camera but that creates a strong incentive for the camera&#x27;s functionality not be exposed to the end user because if you can see what the camera sees you are in a much better place to abuse it.<p>The other thing is that depth cameras just haven&#x27;t gotten better from a practical point of view.  On paper the XBOX One Kinect is a lot better than the original Kinect but in practice it doesn&#x27;t perform any better.

            Real depth cameras perform better and cost far less than the $1500 GPU that you&#x27;re going to need to run the monocular depth network. Monocular depth still struggles to generalize to environments that are even slightly different from the training set.<p>Try git cloning niantic labs&#x27; monodepth2 (or whatever is the state of the art on Papers with Code) and running it on your living room.

            &gt; Similarly you can train a neural network to separate the speaker on a video call from the background, so you just don&#x27;t need a depth camera.<p>These still look so fake, and they tend to blur out objects that you&#x27;re trying to hold up in the video, that I actually created my own virtual camera that blurs progressively more over depths based on RealSense measured depth and looks far more realistic.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;bokeh-camera" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;bokeh-camera</a>

            For video conference calls, where it&#x27;s mostly an extra bonus? Yes.<p>RealSense was used for industrial operations, I personally was looking into them for packing items in transport containers (specific to the factory involved). Poor quality of depth information would mean jams involving robot capable of goring through industrial enclosures, printers, and maintenance engineers.

            ‘Industry’ could care less about an API for depth sensors on the Windows platform — cause industry can’t accept an autonomous system that has a ‘failed to download software update’ dialogue on the screen 80% of the time.<p>Intel’s pitch was always aimed at consumers or maybe light ‘enterprise’ such as an interior decorator who takes measurements with a tablet.

            Your best bet is probably to order cheap IR or color industrial cameras and use stereo block matching. It&#x27;s implemented in OpenCV and works okay-ish. For example, Basler dart USB3 cameras can be synchronized through the IO expension port.<p>That said, maybe it&#x27;s time for someone to produce a good replacement. In my opinion, the RealSense was always quite pricey when compared with what it could do, especially now that we can just run AI algorithms on the edge.

            There is no way this is a replacement for the RealSense depth cameras. These are USB, bus powered, factory calibrated, cameras doing the block matching in an ASIC.

            Yes and no. Of course, a homemade module like this will be way less polished than a RealSense camera. But on the other hand, it&#x27;ll be more flexible and possibly tailored to your problem. So a homemade module might actually have better performance.

            That one only has 4700 dots, which severely limits the potential applications. The one in the iPhone face scanner has 30,000 dots. (Last time I looked, it was very hard to source IR projectors that you could use to make a reasonably accurate depth camera.)

            There are also ToF cameras from Basler, we have their early model, and it works reasonably well, though hot and rather power-hungry. Based on that experience, their current models look promising: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baslerweb.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;cameras&#x2F;3d-cameras&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baslerweb.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;cameras&#x2F;3d-cameras&#x2F;</a>

            if it were <i>possible</i> to make a camera with a GPU or FPGA, there would probably be something, but it isn&#x27;t.  FPGAs and GPUs aren&#x27;t (and can&#x27;t be coerced to become) light sensors or structured light emitters.

            I have been using Intel‘s D-435i for 6D object Pose estimation and i have to say i was not really happy with the quality of the retrieved depth-frames. The Depth images are very noisy, flat surfaces appear heavily wavy thus making it difficult to apply it for tasks that demand a relatively exact 3D representation of the surrounding Space, which is a problem that has been mentioned in a few issues by several other clients. Just Google ghost noise or wavyy Noise D-435i.<p>Moreover the AI implementier is actually Not really AI, it‘s just a bunch of common filters for depth-noise reduction such as a Median filter, just look up the filters. And lastly the depth-measurement becomes more unexact the further the point is away, therefore making it necessary to apply a depth-correction, in my case a correction polynom of 2nd Order.<p>All in all i have to say i‘d not use it again, especially not in industrial contexts. The Kinectv2 delivers a much more stable and reliable depth-image, Even though the realsense programming Interface is mostly nice to work with.

            I can&#x27;t directly compare quality as I&#x27;ve not used Realsense devices, but the main difference is that the OAK-D uses stereoscopy without IR. I&#x27;ve been playing with it in various light conditions and it&#x27;s surprisingly robust in low light as long as features are visible in both cameras. It only requires 1 USB-C cable if you&#x27;re using it over USB3(i.e. a device that can source &gt;1A iirc). I use it with a Jetson Nano(albeit not to its full capacity-yet) with just the USB.

            My company uses ZEDs now, and we are planning to use their new models which are weatherproof, and they currently seem to be the only inexpensive option for outdoor sensing that works out of box. And we don&#x27;t like them: need your own GPU (at least they support Jetson &amp; co.), not enough SW flexibility, USB-only connection limits the cable length.<p>Longer-term, we plan to use our own software with either a pair of conventional machine vision cameras, or, preferably, find some ready-made assembly of a pair of cameras + SoC with full user programmability since we like to be in control of our perception algorithms.

            Zed cameras has a very hostile EULA (borderline illegal, but IANAL), I would not recommend using them unless it&#x27;s absolutely the only option.

        ii.     You will not use or install any Unauthorized Software with an Authorized Accessory. If You do, Your ZED, ZED 2 or ZED Mini camera may stop working permanently at that time or after a later Software update.

        iii.    You will not attempt to defeat or circumvent any Software technical limitation, security, or anti-piracy system. If You do, Your ZED, ZED 2 or ZED Mini camera may stop working permanently at that time or after a later Software update.

        iv.     STEREOLABS may use technical measures, including Software updates, to limit use of the Software to the ZED, ZED 2 or ZED Mini camera, to prevent use of Unauthorized Accessories, and to protect the technical limitations, security and anti-piracy systems in the ZED, ZED 2 or ZED Mini camera.

&lt;...&gt;
```<p>The problem with this license (beyond the fact that they are restricting a lot of user freedom) is that it&#x27;s not specific. For instance, it&#x27;s unclear if improving depth quality by applying an extra median filter is a violation of iii as it eliminates a technical limitation.<p>While I don&#x27;t expect them to actually go after their users, the fact that EULA is so hostile was the reason we can&#x27;t use it in our team.

            Zed sucks, they eat into your GPU instead of on-board ASIC so you have no GPU left to do neural nets or anything else.<p>RealSense on the other hand does computations on-board and consumes very little CPU and no GPU.
