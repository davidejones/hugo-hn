            &quot;A decade from now, we&#x27;ll be able to look back and say which companies or approaches were on the right track. For now, we can only guess.&quot;<p>My first thought was that a decade from now there will be a very limited number of self driving cars on the road, still. Mostly because people (not all people, but most people) will be very scared of the technology, no matter how good it is. Every time there&#x27;s an accident it&#x27;ll make news. Any deaths will make the news. It will not matter if statistically self-driving vehicles are safer.<p>I do wonder, can it ever be as good as or better than a person? Won&#x27;t they always hesitate more, be slower than, and take more time than a real person driving? If it costs a little less to take a self-driving taxi than a person-driving taxi, why would anyone bother? What&#x27;s the motivation for people to go with a self-driven thing over a person driven thing? Will there really be a big price difference?

            I think this is an overly cynical take. 
If the technology gets there, I think there will be massive uptake for in the urban commuter and taxi markets.<p>when pitting Actual safety + massive convenience VS. fear, I think the former will win out for a large part of the market.<p>I also think the majority of people would pay <i>more</i> for a self driven taxi than a person driven taxi. Some reasons might be personal space, privacy, safety, and reliability in terms of dispatch and cancelled rides.

            Insurance companies may well drive (pun intended) the uptake. If self-driving cars are an order of magnitude safer, insurance can be an order of magnitude less expensive. (Or, more likely, human-driven cars will become an order of magnitude more expensive to insure.)

            If cities had really good public transport, and I mean really good services, plus urban planning moved on from current zoning housing &#x2F; commercial &#x2F; work into more mixed zone approach the demand for self-driving kind of disappears.

            My bet is that we will see self driving features in an emergency intervention, where you are still in control generally but if the system predicts a crash in a future time horizon, it will intervene.

            Google will spin out Waymo and GM will buy it. Mark my words.<p>Tesla is the only serious contender so far. They&#x27;re the only company with real life cars on real life roads all over the world. It&#x27;s not just the technology, it&#x27;s deployment of the technology <i>at scale</i>. It&#x27;s a platform.<p>Comma.ai is good too and I think it&#x27;ll be a great option for adding AI-like capabilities to future and past &quot;dumb&quot; cars.<p>I see right around 0% chance for Cruze and others. They&#x27;ll never figure it out. Chinese companies might though.<p>I think we&#x27;ll see Tesla, some emerging Chinese automaker contenders, lots of current brands with smart features, and technology like Comma.ai. The future isn&#x27;t just &quot;does a car have AI?&quot;, it&#x27;s the combination of the hardware of the car, battery management, routing, and platform.<p>Still curious about what Apple intends to do here.

            My pet theory is that Apple won’t produce a car; rather, they’ll produce a car cockpit. A kit of standard, high quality parts, comprising everything a driver touches. So Ford would make a car, Apple would make the screen, steering wheel, mirrors, etc. Might be a trim level or package on existing car models.<p>Every time I drive an unfamiliar car, I see so much opportunity for an Apple-like company to fix the UX of infotainment and quality feel of volume dials, etc.<p>This might be the way everyone else can catch up to Tesla’s UX. Yes, Tesla has issues, but their dang touchscreen doesn’t have a half second input delay.

            Agree, but they&#x27;ve also done things like CarPlay. They obviously saw a problem to solve there; I think it wouldn&#x27;t be hard at all to see them produce first-party CarPlay hardware.

            Can you explain your reasoning and or insight for these conclusions? Personally I see Comma.ai as more likely to &quot;never figure it out&quot; than Cruise and others, but I lack special insight.

            The missing possibility is that no one wins generalized self-driving.<p>Self-driving is not a solvable or a winnable problem, because the problem or question isn’t defined. It’s a probabilistic space, where the world presents scenarios, and a computer must make a “correct” or “good” decision as often as possible, for the widest range of inputs.<p>Because there isn’t a grand unified formula for self-driving, I’m not even sure how we can talk about it being “solved”. Maybe Tesla might be able to self-drive on US or EU or first world clearly marked streets with 99.99% automation, assuming training data exists for all road signs and weather conditions? Is that what we mean by self-driving being solved? That might be possible in the next few years.<p>Other than that, doesn’t seem like there’s going to be much more than driver assist. Driving is a general intelligence problem, not something machine learning can solve - by definition ML can only work on problems it has many known solutions to.

            Why is this so complicated, to me self-driving being solved is when I get into a car to get to work and don&#x27;t have to touch any controls other than the AC maybe. Pretty well-defined, no?

            Self-driving can still be a huge value even if it isn&#x27;t totally automated between every two drivable points. I&#x27;d pay a lot of money for a car that could safely drive itself on highways alone. Get on the highway, fall-asleep, wake up at a rest stop on the other side of the country. In some ways, even better than having a private jet.

            How is Waymo&#x27;s driverless taxi service not self driving? When they come to pick you up there is no-one in the car at all, and when you are collected you are a passenger in the back not a driver.<p>It&#x27;s limited to a single suburb, but it&#x27;s definitely full self driving (unlike a lot of other offerings).
