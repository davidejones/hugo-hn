            What&#x27;s shocking to me is how little Apple management understood of what their actions looked like. Really stunning.<p>For a company that marketed itself as one of the few digital service providers that consumers could trust, I just don&#x27;t understand how they acted this way at all.<p>Either there will be heads rolling at management, or Apple takes a permanent hit to consumer trust.

            &gt; I just don&#x27;t understand how they acted this way at all.<p>There&#x27;s a simple answer to this right? Despite everyone&#x27;s reaction, Apple genuinely believe this is a novel and unique method to catch CSAM without invading people&#x27;s privacy. And if you look at it from Apple&#x27;s point of view that&#x27;s correct: other major cloud providers catch CSAM content on their platform by inspecting every file uploaded, i.e. total invasion of privacy. Apple found a way to preserve that privacy but still catch the bad people doing very bad things to children.

            There is no way to scan people’s content while “respecting their privacy.” The goal should be to create a system where you couldn’t do so even of you wanted to (or the state demanded it).

            &gt; <i>The goal should be to create a system where you couldn’t do so even of you wanted to (or the state demanded it).</i><p>There’s this bizarre notion that using end-to-end encryption can absolve you of responsibility, that the authorities will <i>have</i> to accept an answer of “we literally can’t access it”.<p>That’s just not the case for centralised things: you’re deliberately facilitating some service, government will find you liable for some things in its operation, and if you don’t comply, they’ll fine or shut you down. E2EE doesn’t absolve you from law; law is <i>all about</i> saying you’re not allowed to do things that are physically possible.<p>(Decentralised things, now they can be banned but not truly stopped because there’s no central party to shut down.)

            When end-to-end encryption is done correctly, the answer <i>is</i> &quot;we literally can&#x27;t access it&quot; as a matter of mathematics, whether the state accepts it or not.<p>A state that does not accept it might retaliate against the entity giving that answer or forbid future use of end-to-end encryption without backdoors, but the truth of the answer doesn&#x27;t depend on anyone&#x27;s acceptance.

            Isn&#x27;t that when the state prohibits your service? So then no body cares about your mathematical proof because it&#x27;s a crime to use it.<p>This is what has happened in many countries already.

            Sure, but that&#x27;s a case of &quot;we&#x27;re prohibited from providing end-to-end encryption and preserving user privacy so we can scan for prohibited content as mandated by authorities&quot;, not &quot;we are keeping children safe while still preserving user privacy&quot;<p>Legal terms such as &quot;murder&quot;, &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;rape&quot; do change as effect of regulatory changes. &quot;Encryption&quot; and &quot;privacy&quot; do not.<p>There&#x27;s a limit to how much you can bend semantics in your PR before it breaks and you get backlash.

            But if you&#x27;re a company like apple, it&#x27;d be bad business to wait until large government bans your service&#x2F;device before you respond to it. Much better to read the tea leaves and get a head of it.

            What’s the double speak? It’s quite clear they are trying to maintain e2e encryption while also achieving CSAM scanning. Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Microsoft do this by scanning everything unencrypted. Apple do it while maintaining encryption and are being punished for it. It’s insane.

            Yes, they have the ability, but they found a way NOT to do that. Instead maintaining user privacy. And the world hates them for it, and would prefer they just unencrypted and scanned everything… doesn’t make sense.

            The law may say that government isn&#x27;t allowed to spy on people. So no, the state cannot just come and demand anything it wants.<p>Problem is that the law is self-contradictory and it is up to the judicative institutions to fix it as soon as possible.

            &gt; The goal should be to create a system where you couldn’t do so even of you wanted to (or the state demanded it).<p>You can still do secure backups of your phone without using iCloud, but there isn’t a way for Apple to do end to end encryption of backups transparently like you can with real time communication.  The only way end to end encryption of backups works is to require people keep a separate secure key(s) to avoid losing their data, which means a universal implementation has real direct risk for users.<p>As long as Apple has access to these files the FBI can legally require them to do these searches.  From a pure PR perspective they should have communicated what was already going on before releasing this system because people assume something significant changed.

            Mega.io (from the same people as MegaUpload) has e2e file encryption with just usernames and passwords.<p>There is no reason the password can&#x27;t be the encryption key, with backup keys stored with a trusted third party (eg: your credit union or bank) without notation as to what these backup keys are tied to.

            Standard passwords don’t provide enough entropy to provide secure encryption.<p>Trusting third parties with the password in unencrypted form is either systematic in which case the FBI now just needs collect data from 2 different organizations, or on a case by case basis in which case users will mess it up.  Apple etc would have no way to verify users actually did something to back up their keys.<p>Apple’s current approach is to let users setup their own backups if they want security which allows for privacy just fine without providing a service with fundamental issues.

            The point is that until devices and all their software&#x2F;firmware become fully auditable, there&#x27;s no way to be 100% safe, and we must resort to trust.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem in an ideal world, but the one in which we live is far from even resembling one. Mining data is already a huge business, and governments everywhere would love tools to use to get advantage over people they don&#x27;t like.
There&#x27;s huge motivation and demand for those tools at all levels, and at least governments have the resources to buy them and the power to force whoever implements them to stay silent.
I&#x27;m not implying that spyware tools exist in any phone, PC, smart TV, car, etc. because we can&#x27;t prove they don&#x27;t; that&#x27;s the argument used for UFOs, witches and unicorns, no thanks, but we better think like they do because technology, resources and demand for their adoption are real, and the rest is probability.

            Have you tried disabling various iCloud features? Disabling iCloud is incredibly buggy.<p>I tried disabling iCloud keychain and it just flips back on. Sometimes it asks for a login first. Sometimes it shows a cancel&#x2F;continue modal. Either way, it magically flips back on. No error message.<p>I tried backing up my device to my hard drive (with Photos already on iCloud) and it kept complaining that there wasn’t enough space. It throws error message after warning message that your content will be deleted. It created additional copies of my photos each time my phone synced.<p>To properly back up, I had to copy the photos directory to an external hard drive, delete the original, mark the external hard drive one as the system one and then finally free up enough space to back up. iCloud and the device backup weren’t smart enough to free up space for my backup. In fact, I first backed up all my photos to iCloud first because they said that it would free up space on my hard drive as necessary. LOL.<p>BTW, iCloud keychain is still on for me. Fuck Apple.

            Should they even be doing that though?

            Ethics aside, on-device scanning has the benefit of Constitutional protection, at least in the USA. Any attempt by the Government to compel Apple to expand the on-device searching of privately owned devices to find other things would be a clear-cut 4th Amendment violation.

            What is &quot;this promise&quot;?  Because I would consider it &quot;we will only scan files that you upload to iCloud&quot;.  That was true a month ago and that would be true under this new system.  The only part that is changing is that the scanning happens on your device before upload rather than on an Apple server after upload.  I don&#x27;t view that as a material difference when Apple already controls the hardware and software on both ends.  If we can&#x27;t trust Apple to follow their promise, their products should already have been considered compromised before this change was announced.

            Why is the scanning done on the device in the first place?

            I do wonder what happens in that case to the scan results for the photos that weren&#x27;t yet uploaded.  From earlier articles it sounded like the &quot;voucher&quot; is attached to the image upon upload, so it stands to reason that if you cancel an upload, results don&#x27;t get uploaded for photos that didn&#x27;t get uploaded.

            In my view, Apple is not going to take the risk of changing their mind and not implementing this new scanning feature in order to test the hypothesis that you can satisfy both the people who want to stop CSAM and the people who don&#x27;t want their files scanned. And also, Apple or any other company announcing they will not scan or give up any user data means that criminals, foolish or not, will take notice and start uploading CSAM to their servers. If they get away with it, they&#x27;ve found their new home. That&#x27;s why regulation against this kind of data exists. Possessing CSAM is still a felony.<p>Nobody is arguing about the legality of CSAM itself. It&#x27;s an issue that is not popular to discuss, and of course being on the wrong side of it results in near-universal, justifiable derision. Stopping its spread is absolutely the right thing to do.<p>So at the point that companies will always be held liable for storing it, they will have to put up countermeasures of some kind or find themselves sued out of existence. Server-side scanning is one method, and Apple&#x27;s on-device scanning is another.<p>There are certainly ways that Apple can go too far with whatever it happens to come up with as its solution to stopping CSAM, but there is still seems to have been a line behind which nobody particularly cares how the detection is implemented and life continues as usual. If Apple had chosen not to cross that line, maybe many of the arguments being made here would never have been brought up at all.

            That&#x27;s the point: catching the bad guy foolish enough to keep <i>known</i> CSAM images on their phone, while not technically invading the privacy of any good guys. Anyway, if apple wanted to <i>covertly</i> invade their users&#x27; privacy, they&#x27;d have no technical problems to do so.<p>What it takes to accept is the &quot;nothing to hide&quot; mentality: your files are safe to scan (locally) because they can&#x27;t be known CSAM files. You have to trust the scanner. You allow the scanner to touch your sensitive files because you&#x27;re not the bad guy, and you want the bad guy be caught (or at least forced off the platform).<p>And this is, to my mind, the part Apple wasn&#x27;t very successful at communicating. The whole thing should have started with an educational campaign well ahead of time. The privacy advantage should have been explained again and again: &quot;unlike every other vendor, we won&#x27;t siphon your files unecrypted for checking; we do everything locally and are unable to compromise your sensitive bits&quot;. Getting one&#x27;s files scanned should have become a badge of honor among the users.<p>But, for some reason, they tried to do it in a low-key and somehow hasty manner.

            Yes. You don&#x27;t leave the toilet doors open, not because you don&#x27;t &quot;have nothing to hide&quot;, but because privacy is a right.<p>Everybody knows what goes on behind that door. And yet, everyone would much prefer to close it. Apple&#x27;s method is equivalent to the toilet door being removed, so that you cannot do anything nefarious behind that door.<p>Your phone also (on average) have nothing to hide, but that&#x27;s also why you need privacy on your devices.

            I mostly agree, though I will argue for the other side; child predators don&#x27;t exactly have a track record for intelligence. Pedophiles still to this day get caught trading CP on Facebook of all places. I think engaging in that kind of activity requires a certain number of brain cells misfiring. Watch some old episodes of To Catch A Predator. Most of those guys were borderline retarded or had obvious personality disorders.

It&#x27;s doubtful, but there&#x27;s room for more study.<p>Are the pedophiles that are <i>offenders</i> of low intelligence?  <i>Significantly more offending pedophiles are of low intelligence than the general population</i>.  Yes, the factors at play may also apply to other forms of crime.  But when you factor out <i>non-offending</i> pedophiles, those we aren&#x27;t as concerned with in regards to CSAM, the ones that are <i>caught</i> aren&#x27;t exactly the cream of the crop.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;ve <i>met</i> a handful of pedophiles, both convicted and not.  Every one of them either was clearly mentally retarded or bordering on retardedness, or they had a severe personality disorder.  Yes, it&#x27;s a small sample size, but the ones that were caught did so doing the dumbest of shit (putting aside the horrific nature of child exploitation in the first place).  This even includes a <i>female</i> pedophile, who was both stupid <i>and</i> psychopathic, and I find it funny that one of those studies questions the very existence of female pedophiles.<p>There are many pedophiles that are of above-average intelligence.  Most may not even be considered &quot;dumb&quot;.  But to imply that there&#x27;s no difference in distribution of, frankly, <i>dumb people to smart people</i> between different behaviors is absurd in that it ignores any sort of relation implication that intelligence has on said behaviors.<p>As a group, the data does not suggest that pedophiles are exceptionally intelligent, but rather the opposite.<p>So yes, while I believe there is a privacy concern (I said earlier I would not want such software or hardware running on my own compuer), I stand by my conclusion that CSAM detection would catch a significant number of pedophiles and probably continue to do so for some time.  The point of such systems isn&#x27;t to be a superweapon to catch every pedophile.  The ones that it might catch happen to be the ones who are <i>most likely to offend</i>.  If you play the stupid game of uploading CSAM to Apple iCloud, you win the stupid prize of getting convicted, and it just so happens that a ton of pedophiles are likely to do something that boneheaded.

            That sounds like survivorship bias.  Of course the people who get caught for doing things the stupid way are going to be branded as stupid.

            Except intelligence is clustered with other pathologies such as poor impulse control.  Knowledge of the law is not the end-all-be-all of human behavior.  Both the intelligent and unintelligent are capable of poor impulse control, but the unintelligent are statistically much more likely to exhibit a lack of impulse control, among other things such as difficulty in long-term reasoning and connecting one&#x27;s actions with adverse effects.

            The theory is that if you make it too risky to possess CSAM, demand for it will drop, leading to less exploitation.  I don&#x27;t know if I buy that theory, but... there it is.<p>Compare this to the war on drugs.  There is huge demand for drugs.  Many drugs are highly illegal to possess, and a lot of people get jailed for possessing them.  And yet most of us consider the war on drugs to be an abject failure that hasn&#x27;t done much more than create inequity.<p>Why should something like CSAM possession be any different?  I wish it <i>was</i> different, and these sorts of tactics would reduce this awful problem, but I&#x27;m just not convinced it does.

            The privacy aspect does seem novel, and that paper evaluates the various aspects of privacy and the quality of perceptual hashes. However, anything concerning privacy (of client or server data) is orthogonal to the vision methods underpinning the system, which are well understood and are the primary cause of the post. For that matter, I don’t see how the paper’s proofs of privacy and&#x2F;or formalization of the problem help with hash collisions. And that particular paper doesn’t use deep learning methods which are probably easier to attack with off-the-shelf methods.

            Maybe Apple was focused on keeping CSAM <i>off</i> a cloud resource that <i>really</i> is Apple&#x27;s in both a practical and technical sense. Merely scanning after upload maybe doesn&#x27;t accomplish that because the material already has arrived in an Apple resource and someone might define that as a failure.  Viewed from a perspective of iCloud compliance it sorta makes sense.  No one ought to feel a lot of (legal) security deploying a system that could be used to host CSAM, from the Blockchain to whatever, it sounds like a don&#x27;t-wizz-on-the-electric-fence kind of risk.<p>Saddened by the privacy-adverse functionality on handsets but Apple seems to be hitting the nail on the head that poor <i>communication</i> principally is driving outrage.

            With the new system, it still arrives on the server, and they can&#x27;t even know about it until some threshold has been passed - and then the servers still have to scan it.<p>So it&#x27;s not even accomplishing &quot;keeping it off the servers.&quot;

            Actually it&#x27;ll do an excellent job of keeping it off their servers.<p>Apple&#x27;s actions will be effective at making sure every CSAM aficionado will not trust their device. Or, if they&#x27;re tech savvy, they will at least know not to co-mingle their deepest darkest secrets alongside photos of their mum and last night&#x27;s dinner.<p>If you think Apple&#x27;s very big, very public blow-up is making waves in the hacker&#x2F;security&#x2F;libertarian crowd, just imagine how big it&#x27;s blowing up in the CSAM community right now. I dare say it&#x27;s probably all they&#x27;ve been talking about for the past two weeks. Unlike places like Hacker News where there&#x27;s plenty of people desperate to drag Apple through the coals, the CSAM community will be highly motivated to have a precise understanding of what Apple is doing. I dare say that they&#x27;ll be <i>extremely well</i> informed about exactly what Apple&#x27;s plans entail and how to work around them.

            It is indeed meaningfully different: your sensitive data never leaves your device in order to be scanned. There can&#x27;t be a crack in Apple servers that would expose files of millions of users uploaded for scanning.<p>Eventually it could lead to Apple platform not having any CSAM content, or any known legally objectionable content, because any sane perpetrator would migrate to other platforms, and less sane, caught.<p>This, of course, takes the user base to overwhelmingly agree that keeping legally objectionable content is a bad thing and should be exposed to police, and to trust the whatever body which defines the hashes of objectionable content.

            I do agree that it&#x27;s more private, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s better.<p>I&#x27;m fine with the idea that if I upload stuff to someone else&#x27;s server, they may take a look at it and maybe even punish me for what I&#x27;ve uploaded.  Certainly if I encrypt the data before I upload it, they can&#x27;t do that.  But if I don&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s fine with me if they do.<p>But my device should not be snitching on me.  Yes, this device-side scanning is supposedly gated on enabling uploads to iCloud, but that doesn&#x27;t really make for much of a distinction to me.  And since Apple certainly has the capability, they are likely one secret court order away from being required to scan even photos that aren&#x27;t being uploaded, at least on some targeted subset of devices.

            The scenario is far more like this<p>3. The home builder installs a TSA scanner in all newly built homes.  The scanners will scan all items as they are put away into drawers and cupboards, attempting to detect the presence of banned items.<p>Then the TSA Agents say they won&#x27;t report you until at least 30 banned items are detected, even though you haven&#x27;t flown in 10 years and don&#x27;t have banned materials.  As the TSA Agents walk back to their car, you overhear words like warrant, trouble, and tap amidst their chuckles.  What could go wrong with that?

            Let&#x27;s be real, of course many of those people will be child abusers.<p>But let&#x27;s also be real about something else.

Worse, how many child abusers don&#x27;t share CSAM online?

            That&#x27;s a tedious debate that has been rehashed to death. Finding somebody who has CSAM without being a child abuser doesn&#x27;t save even a single child.

Surely the majority of child abuse happens independently of the online sharing of CSAM.<p>And is that really worth the suspension of important civil rights?

            &gt; other major cloud providers catch CSAM content on their platform by inspecting every file uploaded<p>So does Apple.<p>EDIT: some people don’t like that answer, but “inspecting” in this context clearly means “digitally inspecting” (Google does not physically look at every file) and Apple does this with files that are uploaded. They do it in device, but it’s still inspected. That’s the whole point of this controversy, that there’s not much difference to people WHERE apple inspects and on device is actually arguably worse. Your sentence does not in any way distinguish what Apple does from what others do.

            Repeating myself from another thread but… China.<p>Conjecture, admittedly:<p>1. Apple cannot lose the Chinese market. Huge and more important fastest growing geo for the company.<p>2. China is self deprecating elements of its own tech sector (aggressive crackdowns on both established  companies like tencent and Alibaba as well as individual web sites). They are clearly cleaning house from a surveillance and control perspective. Apple is not immune, but it’s an American behemoth, so open door crackdowns are impossible.<p>I don’t think Apple’s CSAM push and China’s crackdown are purely coincidental.<p>Who can argue with stemming child abuse? It’s the type of hot button issue that affords broad acceptance for intrusive tech.<p>The leap from scanning for abuse to scanning for anti regime content is more like a tiny step.<p>It seems obvious from afar that the company adamant about refusal to unlock a potential terrorist’s iPhone on privacy principles (with the attendant marketing benefits) would so suddenly <i>force push</i> (and therefore ensure collection massive training data with or without opt-in for Chinas v2.0) such a boldly invasive feature addition.<p>Turns out vertical integration is both gift and curse (dependent on the whims of the integrator) for on-device privacy and autonomy.

            If you use Apple devices, you are agreeing to their ToS which since 2019 give them the right to pre-screen your uploads for any <i>potentially illegal</i> (sic) content, not specifically CSAM imagery.<p>If Apple happens to use similar ToS in China (no idea if true), you bet CCP would be all over this clause.<p>A worst-case wild guess from the pessimist in me: they had to add this clause in 2019 to appease CCP, and then they got thinking if they could make use of it for the greater good (tm), too. Hopefully it’s very incorrect.

            Of course the CCP loves stuff like this. The big thing is will apple acquiesce to keeping mum about scanning everyone&#x27;s stuff at the directive of the government. Also will that just be a &quot;china&quot; build or will it be in the USA code base but &quot;flipped off&quot;

            The thing that&#x27;s shocking to me is that Google, Microsoft  and all the big names in tech have been scanning everything in your account (email, cloud drive, photos, etc) for the past decade, without any noticeable uproar.<p>Apple announces that it is going to start scanning iCloud Photos only, and that their system is set to ignore anything below a threshold of ~30 positives before triggering a human review, and people lose their minds.

            I think the difference here is that it&#x27;s ON YOUR DEVICE.  I think there&#x27;s a pretty clear understanding that if you upload stuff to a cloud provider they can do whatever they want with it.  This is different.  This is reaching into what has up until now mostly been considered a private place.  Law enforcement often has to get warrants to search this kind of thing.<p>This is the difference between putting CSAM on a sign in your front yard (maybe not quite front yard but I can&#x27;t come up with quite the same physical equivalent to a cloud provider) and keeping it in a password protected vault in your basement.  One of those things is protected in the U.S. by laws against unlawful search and seizure.  Cloud and on your device are two very different things and consumers are right to be alarmed.<p>I&#x27;ll say it again, if you are concerned with this privacy violation, sell your Apple stock and categorically refuse to purchase Apple devices.  Also go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nospyphone.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nospyphone.com&#x2F;</a> and make your voice heard there.

            Only the safety tokens are generated on your device, the action triggering scan happens in the cloud (just like all the others) and then it goes to human review, so if it&#x27;s a hash collision it&#x27;d be caught there when they review the images, and they can only review the images that matched CSAM.<p>I honestly can&#x27;t  find the uproar here. Google devices can face match photos offline... so they are applying a neural net (scanning) ON THE DEVICE! How is that not worse than what apple do?

            One is matching a face--yes, concerning, and I don&#x27;t like it but IMO Google has had a much worse privacy reputation for quite some time--and the other is reporting private data to law enforcement and potentially abusive parents.  It&#x27;s quite a bit different.<p>The difference can also be seen from a customer service perspective.  One is a feature that lets you sort according to which friends you were with.  The other is a feature that puts you in jail.  No thanks.  Not gonna pay money for that.

            No it reports you to Apple, Apple report you to police.

            A poster upthread made an analogy that I really like.  Sure, like all analogies, it&#x27;s imperfect, but I think it strikes at why many people are uneasy about this.<p>Let&#x27;s say the TSA were to install air-travel-contraband scanners in everyone&#x27;s homes, but promise only to scan things that are being put into your luggage as you prepare to go to the airport.  And let&#x27;s say that this became a requirement if you want to board a plane.<p>That&#x27;s what this feels like.  I&#x27;m fine with Google scanning through everything in my GMail account, or everything I&#x27;ve uploaded to GDrive, or created in GDocs.  That stuff is on their servers, unencrypted, and I explicitly put it there.<p>But I&#x27;m sure as hell not going to let Google install something on my laptop (or phone!) that lets them look at my stuff, even if they pinky-promise that they&#x27;ll only scan stuff that I intend to upload.

            Here&#x27;s the reason for the sudden uproar: The scanning of things on third party servers was just barely tolerated by a lot of people, whether it&#x27;s for advertising purposes or government intrusion. People accept it because it&#x27;s considered reasonable for these third parties to scan data in exchange for providing a service for free (e.g. Google), or because they need to have some degree of accountability for what is on their servers.<p>When that scanning gets moved from the cloud to being <i>on your device</i>, a boundary is violated.<p>When that boundary is violated by a company who makes extreme privacy claims like saying that privacy is a &quot;fundamental human right&quot;[1], yes, people will &quot;lose their minds&quot; over it. This shouldn&#x27;t be shocking at all.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.com&#x2F;privacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.com&#x2F;privacy</a>

            When the scanning gets moved from the cloud to being on device, Apple itself cannot see the results of the scan until the risk that the result is only a false positive is greatly reduced.<p>You would have to have 30 false positives before Apple can see anything, which is unlikely, but the next step is still a human review, since it&#x27;s not impossible.

            I don&#x27;t care.  It&#x27;s my device (at least that&#x27;s how Apple used to advertise it) and I disagree with Apple&#x27;s policy, full stop.

            You have clearly misunderstood my position as you have replied to 2 of my comments already.  You seem to have an &quot;Apple vs the world&quot; mentality when my point is entirely about holding Apple accountable to their own marketing.  You sound like a bizarre Apple apologist and I&#x27;m tired of trying to explain myself to you when all you want to do is explain to me why Apple is better than everybody when I do not care and also fundamentally disagree.<p>If you think Apple&#x27;s approach is the best you&#x27;re allowed to think that.

            The other companies didn&#x27;t advertise and pride themselves on being privacy focused.  Part of the appeal of Apple was that you could avoid that issue and they touted it regularly.  Now they&#x27;re telling their customers to go fuck themselves (so long as they&#x27;re 18 or older).

            Conducting the scan on the user&#x27;s device instead of on the companies server is more private.<p>Apple can&#x27;t decrypt the results of the scan until the ~30 image threshold is crossed and a human review is triggered.<p>Given Google&#x27;s reluctance to hire humans when a poorly performing algorithm is cheaper, are they turning over every single false positive without a human review?

            I guess people had a sense of ownership of these devices and they feel that it’s doing some they they don’t want. If ownership means control, maybe in the digital age full ownership&#x2F;control is not really possible on a managed device like the iPhone. There are other example like the John Deer tractor issues.

            Sure, you own the data, but you don’t have any control on what’s happening to it. Just like iPhone users, we own the physical device but we only control certain aspects of what it’s doing, and the boundaries are not set by us, but by Apple.

            Google is open about the fact they scan and track everything, they even make it a point of convenience &quot;hey, we looked at your email and found a plane ticket, based on where you are, you should leave in 2 hours if you want to be at the airport on time&quot;.<p>Facebook, even more so, they are explicitly anti-privacy to the point of being insulting.<p>Microsoft will happily show you everything they may send when you install Windows, you can sometimes refuse, but not always. They are a bit less explicit than Google, but privacy is rarely on the menu.<p>As for Amazon, their cloud offers are mostly for businesses, different market, but still, for consumers, they don&#x27;t really insist on privacy either.<p>So that if any of these company scan your pictures for child porn, it won&#x27;t shock anyone, because we know it is what they do.<p>But Apple claims privacy as a core value, half of their ads are along the lines of &quot;we are not like the others, we respect your privacy, everything on your device stays on your device, etc...&quot;, they announce every (often legitimate) privacy feature with great fanfare, etc... So much that people start to believe it. But with that, people realize that Apple is not so different from the others after all, and if they bought an overpriced device based on that promise, I understand why they are pissed off.

Through YouTube, we make CSAI Match available for free to NGOs and industry partners like Adobe, Reddit, and Tumblr, who use it to counter the spread of online child exploitation videos on their platforms as well.<p>&gt;  We devote significant resources—technology, people, and time—to detecting, deterring, removing, and reporting child sexual exploitation content and behavior. Since 2008, we’ve used “hashing” technology, which creates a unique digital ID for each known child sexual abuse image, to identify copies of images on our services that may exist elsewhere.

            That’s like saying the federal reserve is “private”. No, the NECMEC is not a private entity. Not only was it heavily funded&#x2F;created by the gov, but more importantly it is granted special legal status. You and I can’t just spin up our own CSAM database. Nor do we have any laws that say that any companies aware of CSAM must send it to us and only us.

            Because it isn’t about the CSAM scanning.  Apple keeps reframing the argument back to that. most people expect that google and Microsoft to scan files on their servers for CSAM, people object to Apple turning your phone against its owner, and once building out the capability to do this only policy prevents it from being abused.

            Right now, it seems like there are two specific groups of people that are upset with Apple: Freedom evangelists (e.g. EFF) and tech futurists (e.g. HN). They&#x27;re saying, essentially:<p>&quot;Apple does not have my permission to use my device to scan my iCloud uploads for CSAM&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;This is a slippery slope that could result in Apple enforcing thoughtcrimes&quot;<p>Neither of these viewpoints are particularly agreeable to the general public in the US, as far as I can determine from my non-tech farming city. Once the fuss in tech dies down, I expect Apple will see a net <i>increase</i> in iCloud adoption — all the fuss we&#x27;re generating is free advertising for their efforts to stop child porn, and the objections raised are too domain-specific to matter.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to say for certain <i>which</i> of your outcomes will occur, but there&#x27;s definitely two missing from your list. Corrected, it reads:<p>&quot;Either there will be heads rolling at management, or Apple takes a permanent hit to consumer trust, or Apple sees no effect whatsoever on consumer trust, or Apple sees a permanent boost in consumer trust.&quot;<p>I expect it&#x27;ll be &quot;no effect&quot;, but if I had to pick a second guess, it would be &quot;permanent boost&quot;, well offsetting any losses among the tech&#x2F;free&#x2F;lib crowd.

            You forgot the most important point of the last 24 hours:<p>&quot;Apple has created a system for detecting CSAM on local devices which has already proven vulnerable to cheap perceptual hash collision attacks. It&#x27;s now highly inconceivable Apple will be able to deploy this technology as-is without having their users exploited.&quot;<p>In other words it&#x27;s not just about privacy or thoughtcrimes anymore but should be viewed as actually dangerous to use their devices. I feel a bit dramatic even typing that out but I.. think it&#x27;s true?

            I would also warn you against owning any device with a radio. Carriers control the radio towers and can be compelled by government agencies and selfish corporate interests to exploit remote execution vulnerabilities in radio chips in order to plant CSAM content onto devices.<p>How dramatic is too dramatic? When does something that hasn’t happened to you or anyone you know become a risk you’re willing to sacrifice personal convenience to mitigate? Will you be divesting yourself of all wireless radio hardware? If not, then why would you be worried about users being exploited through a more clumsy and less effective process such as CSAM signature hacking?<p>The piece of information you’re taking for granted, that few in free&#x2F;tech&#x2F;lib are confronting, is the assumption that this process can be exploited at scale to harm millions of people.<p>So far as I can tell, there will probably be zero or one false positive CSAM matches that pass the known algo, the unknown algo, the human blurred comparison, and the human unblurred comparison — all steps that must occur before law enforcement is invoked to collect digital evidence - in the first year.<p>How many false positives (to the nearest 10^X) do <i>you</i> think the system will generate in the first year that result in law enforcement actions? Your words suggest that everyone is vulnerable, and there are 10^9 users, so do you believe there will be 10^9 false positives in the first year? Do you think only a thousand people will be affected, so 10^3? How do you judge which is more likely correct?<p>It is unlikely that this system will generate 10^9 false positives, or else it never would have passed QA. I encourage you to consider how you would personally quantify this risk, and then also look up the quantified risks for killing someone while driving a car or getting struck by lightning while indoors. I don’t know what the actual reality will be, but I don’t think it&#x27;s a very large X.

            I will believe them if they put their money where their mouth is: as a clause to iOS user agreement saying that if they ever use they ever use this functionality for anything other than CSAM or on anything other than iCloud photos, ever person who was subjected to this scan will be paid 100 million dollars by Apple.

            Apple&#x27;s management can also be prone to hubris. This is also very much a case where the engineers were left unbridled without any proper check from marketing and comms, I suspect because of the extreme complexity of the problem and the sheer impossibility of putting it into layman terms effectively.

            Maybe the implementation is difficult to put into layman’s terms, but the high level goals - scanning the devices for child porn - most definitely is not.<p>I’m not buying the “engineers were left unbridled” argument, I think there just have been a level of obliviousness in much wider a part of the organization for something like this to happen.

            What abuses apply to CSAM scanning in this hybrid pipeline which don’t apply to iCloud Backup? If they scanned on the server, why couldn’t governments “slippery slope” abuse the system by requiring that all files on iOS end up in iCloud Backup, where they can be scanned by the system?<p>Since the announcement, I can think of a dozen ways Apple could be easily forced into scanning all the contents of your device by assembling features they’ve already shipped. Yet they haven’t. At some point, people need to produce evidence that Apple cannot hold the line they’ve said they will.

            The governments always could do that, but then they&#x27;d be the target of the pushback, and there&#x27;s already significant mistrust of governments wrt surveillance because of how it can be abused.<p>What we have now is Apple, with its &quot;strong privacy&quot; record, normalizing this. If it succeeds, it would be that much easier for the governments to tackle other stuff onto it. Or, say, lower the threshold needed to submit images for review. I can easily picture some senator ranting about how unacceptable it is that somebody with only 20 CSAM photos won&#x27;t be flagged, and won&#x27;t somebody please think of the children?<p>And yes, if it comes to that, Apple definitely cannot hold the line.

            Privacy means “you pay for the device so we don’t sell your attention to advertisers.” That’s it. There’s no protection against state level actors (Pegasus, CSAM scanning, etc.).<p>If your threat model includes being the target of someone who will plant child pornography on your phone, you are already fucked. And no, Apple isn’t suddenly going to scan Chinese iPhones for Winnie the Pooh memes. They don’t have to.

            Yeah, talk to people that know nothing on the issue besides that they want to “protect the kids”.<p>Why stop there? Get out of the HN bubble on the patriot act, instead ask your neighbor’s wife her thoughts on it.

            Because it&#x27;s not a cryptographic hash where a one bit difference results in a completely different hash. It&#x27;s a perceptual hash that operates on a smaller bitmap derived from the image so it&#x27;s plausible that some innocuous images might result in similar derivations; and there might be intentionally crafted innocently-looking images that result in an offensive derivative.<p>Salvador Dali could do something similar by hand in 1973 in <i>Gala Contemplating the Mediterranean Sea</i> [1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lincoln_in_Dalivision" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lincoln_in_Dalivision</a>

            This is a great answer but that’s not actually the GP’s contention. Their argument is essentially “so what if there’s a collision, the human review will catch it”. And to that I’d say that the same is supposed to occur for the no-fly list and we all know how that works in practice.<p>The mere accusal itself of possessing CSAM can be life ruining if it gets to that stage. More importantly, a collision will effectively allow warrantless searches, at least of the collided images.

            Those are two almost identical images based off each other.<p>I know that that &quot;think of the children&quot; is a meme, but I think this illustrates the point for apple.

            I think you are getting downvoted because thats the same image I replied to.<p>Looking at those two images its plain to see why they are identical.<p>And if someone is sending you CSA material, isn&#x27;t that the point of this process. Apple identifies it as CSA, can give you a warning its sensitive, and identify they authorities that people are sending CSA.<p>Again - this seems like a win. If Apple can automatically identify CSA material, en-masse thats good.<p>edit: It looks like they are different URLs, but Twitter only allows people to see replies if they are logged in, so I can&#x27;t see that example.<p>edit 2: On further thought, if someone can use CSA material and produce an innocuous image with a similar hash, if they send that image to you, its still proof that the sender had CSA material.

Apple is a US company with obligations to report certain crimes they become aware of, and NCMEC is a US government-tied organisation that dismissed privacy concerns as &quot;the screeching voices of the minority&quot;.<p>Consider if the honeypot images (manipulated to match CSAM hashes) are terrorist recruitment material for example.

            And if you make the second image be actual, 18+ porn? Will Apple be able to tell the difference between that and CSAM after the blur is applied?<p>Bonus points if you match poses, coloration, background, etc.

            The only way to match poses, coloration, background, etc is to possess illegal CSAM content. If you do so successfully, you will result in your crafted image passing the blur check and reaching the agency that possesses the original image for final verification, where it will immediately fail because it is obviously a replica. You will then trigger that agency leading law enforcement to find the <i>creator</i> of the image, so that they can arrest whoever possesses CSAM content in order to model replicas after it.<p>I think that&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable outcome, since anyone with the hubris to both possess CSAM content <i>and</i> create replicas of it especially deserves to be arrested. Do you see a more problematic outcome here?

            This assumes that it&#x27;s impossible to reverse the perceptual hashes used here in such a way that you could determine poses and coloration, for one.<p>And in retrospect, you don&#x27;t need to match that - you just need it to appear obviously pornographic after the blur is applied in order to get past Apple&#x27;s reviewers. After that, the lucky individual&#x27;s life is in the hands of the police&#x2F;prosecutors. (I have to imagine that both real and faked cases will look pretty much like &quot;Your honor&#x2F;members of the jury, this person&#x27;s device contained numerous photos matching known CSAM.

            My privacy is violated every time I leave my home. Anyone can take a photo of me and look up the FBI Most Wanted and see if I’m there. If they think someone is me and they’re wrong, they can still summon law enforcement, and I’ll still be mistreated for their poor judgement.<p>Is this just as unacceptable as the CSAM scanning? Should all public photography be banned, in order to reduce the risk of false positive identifications of innocent people as criminals to zero? Or is that an acceptable degree of privacy impingement for the good of society?<p><i>Is</i> Apple’s implementation an acceptable trade of impingement and risk, for good for society? We <i>do</i> live in a society, and so zero impingement upon privacies is never going to be acceptable (sorry, free&#x2F;tech&#x2F;libs). But instead of discussing whether Apple’s approach violates privacy minimally or not in order to get the job done, these discussions here just keep circling the drain of “putting my privacy at risk by any degree is never acceptable”, when that drain is cemented shut by the existence of society and will never lead to a valid outcome.

            No - the reporting is absolutely terrible here.<p>1) These are more share similar visual features than crypto hashes.<p>2) HN posters have been claiming that apple reviewing flagged photos is a felony -&gt; because HN commentators are claiming flagged photos are somehow &quot;known&quot; CASM - this is also likely totally false. The images may not be CASM and the idea that a moderation queue results in felony charges is near ridiculous.<p>3) This illustrates why apple&#x27;s approach here (manual review after 30 images or so flagged) is not unreasonable. The push to say that this review is unnecessary is totally misguided.<p>4) They use words like &quot;hash collision&quot; for something that is not a hash. In fact, different devices will calculate DIFFERENT hashes for the SAME image at times.<p>One request I have - before folks cite legal opinions - those opinions should have the name of a lawyer on them. Not this &quot;I talked to a lawyer&quot; because we have no idea if you described things accurately.

            This is incorrectly applied. Offering a legal opinion is fundamentally different from offering legal advice. We publish legal opinions in academic and professional publications all the time. That doesn&#x27;t mean we have an attorney-client relationship with anyone who reads those opinions, or that we would advise that someone act in accordance with such an opinion, particularly if no court has adopted our position yet.

            Those are addressed to a court or government agency in a specific place.  The advice offered isn&#x27;t for a bunch of rando people on the internet across all number of jurisdictions.  And it is only general advice about an area of law, normally at the appellate level, not specific fact-dependent advice to a real flesh-and-blood person.

            &gt; The images may not be CASM and the idea that a moderation queue results in felony charges is near ridiculous.<p>Agree, and I think this is backed up by real world experience.  Has Facebook or anyone working on their behalf ever been charged for possession of CSAM?  I guarantee they&#x27;ve seen some.  Probably a lot, in fact.  That&#x27;s why we have recurring discussions about the workers and the compensation they get (or not) for the really horrid work they are tasked with.

            From what I understand it&#x27;s even more cut and dry than that. If you submit a report to the NCMEC you are generally required to (securely) keep a copy of the image(s) being reported and any related info for a period of time. That&#x27;s part of the rules. You are also only compelled to report things that you know are bad, so verification before reporting makes sense. The idea that they would be charged with a crime for doing what is essentially required by law is flat out wrong. Unless they are storing the material insecurely once confirmed bad or otherwise mishandling the process, they seem to be following the law as I understand it.
IANAL but I have an account with the NCMEC for a service I run, so I have looked through their documentation and relevant laws to try to understand the requirements placed on me as a service provider.

            Thank you for a first hand report. All that makes sense - you clearly can&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t &quot;pass around images&quot; even in the office - so fair that it is super strict once something is confirmed as X.

            More of an anecdote, but our software allows users to upload files, documents, images and such. This in turn means, technically speaking, our platform could be used to distribute malware or other illegal content. I&#x27;ve asked: Well what happens if that occurs and we as a company becomes aware?<p>Overall, we&#x27;re advised to take about these steps there. First off, report it. Second, remove all access for the customer, terminate the accounts, lock them out asap. Third, prevent access to the content without touching it. For example, if it sits on a file system and a web server could serve it, blacklist URLs on a loadbalancer. Fourth, if necessary, begin archiving and securing evidence. But if possible in any way, disable content deletion mechanisms and wait for legal advice, or the law enforcement to tell you how to gather the data.<p>But overall, you&#x27;re not immediately guilty for someone abusing your service, and no one is instantly guilty for detecting someone is abusing your service.

            IMO the risk is that the reaction will be viewed amongst the general population as an overreaction, leading to it being ignored on the next go around.  Many people are going to listen to what Apple says, look at their piles of technical documentation, see the word CSAM, and conclude that the opposing side is crazy.

            This is one of the most common misunderstandings, both when people are arguing for or against.<p>People who understand tech well enough to recognize hashes like MD5 and SHA don&#x27;t dive deep enough to understand that this is something completely different.<p>I even suspect this is deliberate from Apple&#x27;s side when announcing and talking about these changes - making people wrongly believe that only exact matches will trigger, except possibly in extremely rare cases and under concious attacks.<p>They could have called it &quot;fingerprint&quot; or something but deliberately went with a technical term that even confuses technical people who know well enough what a hash usually means.<p>Vice is falling victim to this misunderstanding stemming from the conflation of &quot;hash&quot;.

            EDIT: Parent edited his comment to clarify. I understand the point now. I&#x27;m wrong about similar images needing to have &quot;similar&quot; hashes. Those hashes either need to match exactly, or else not be considered at all.<p>IGNORE THIS: I think that&#x27;s the parent comment&#x27;s point. These are definitely <i>not</i> cryptographic hashes, since they—by design and necessity—need to mirror hash similarity to the perceptual similarity of the input images.

            They are almost the opposite. The programs create different hashes (though very similar) depending on platform you run on even with SAME input. No crypto hash works even close to this.

            Doing that would mean the NeuralHash would change though. And you&#x27;d have to not only get CLIP to identify CSAM in the generated image but also negate the parts of the generated image that are causing CLIP to label it as &quot;generated&quot; (while still colliding with the target NeuralHash).<p>Unclear how hard this would actually be in practice (if I were going to attempt it, the first thing I&#x27;d try is to evolve a colliding image with something like CLIP+VQGAN) but certainly harder than finding a collision alone.

            No. The brazen part of this is Apple trying to sell the public on this being okay, effective to the point of mitigating the abuse potential. False negative AND false positive have to counterweight the existence of the vector for abuse. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re measuring against. You can&#x27;t even guarantee that. This isn&#x27;t even close to a safe or effective move. The risk management on this is hosed.

            Exactly right. The tech Apple uses can be one of two things:<p>1. It requires a perfect 1:1 match (their documentation says this is not the case);
2. Or it has some freedom in detecting a match, probably including a match with a certain percentage.<p>If it&#x27;s the former, it&#x27;s completely useless. A watermark or a randomly chosen pixel with a slightly different hue and the hash would be completely different.<p>So, it&#x27;s not #1. It&#x27;s going to be #2. And that&#x27;s where it becomes dangerous. The government of the USA is going to look for child predators. The government of Saudi Arabia is going to track down known memes shared by atheists, and they will be put to death; heresy is a capital offence over there. And China will probably do their best to track down Uyghurs so they can make the process of elimination even easier.<p>It&#x27;s not like Apple hasn&#x27;t given in to dictatorships in the past. This tech is absolutely going to kill people.

            I have to say that I’m just sad about this. I was really convinced that Apple really believed in privacy and they will never do this (having a framework which can scan your device content). But maybe they already had it and this was like: “there is this delta and Afghanistan let’s make announcement now”<p>We are just one stupid terrorist attack from full surveillance of everybody.

            Honest question - as far as I could find out the files will be scanned <i>on device</i> but <i>before</i> upload to iCloud. Before they were scanned in the cloud <i>after</i> upload. That&#x27;s the change as far as I understand it. But if it&#x27;s scanned before upload then what is the difference? A few seconds? It would be scanned either way, before or after upload. Is that it?<p>What I&#x27;m basically getting at is: are the files scanned after the user has expressed the intention of uploading them? That&#x27;s what I understood. Am I wrong? Are the files scanned the moment they appear on your device, regardless of you iCloud status (even if you have disabled iCloud somehow)?<p>Edit: typo

            Perhaps I have I missed this in all the discussions of Apple&#x27;s latest move but has anyone considered the following questions.<p>Does Apple&#x27;s solution only stop people from uploading illegal files to Apple&#x27;s servers or does it stop them from uploading the files to any server.<p>If Apple intends to control the operation of a computer purchased from Apple after the owner begins using it, does Apple have a duty to report illegal files found on that computer and stop them from being shared (anywhere, not just through Apple&#x27;s datacenters).<p>To me, this is why there is a serious distinction between a company detecting and policing what files are stored on their computers (i.e., how other companies approach this problem) and a company detecting and policing what files someone else&#x27;s computer is storing and can transfer over the internet (in this case, unless I am mistaken, only to Apple&#x27;s computers).<p>Mind you, I am not familiar with the details of exactly how Apple&#x27;s solution works nor the applicable criminal laws so these questions might be irrelevant.  However I was thinking that if Apple really wanted to prevent the trafficking of ostensibly illegal files then wouldn&#x27;t Apple seek to prevent their transfer not only to Apple&#x27;s computers but to <i>any</i> computer (and also report them to the proper authorities).  What duty does Apple have if they can &quot;see into the owner&#x27;s computer&quot; and they detect illegal activity.  If Apple is in remote control of the computer, e.g., they can detect the presence&#x2F;absence of files remotely and allow or disallow full user control through the OS, then does Apple have a duty to take action.

            What has been stated is that this all _only_ happens as photos are about to be uploaded to iCloud photos (not to be confused with iCloud backup, a totally separate thing).  This is currently done server-side on iCloud photoes. This appears to move it client side.

            The point is that turning it off resolves the issue, but if someone refuses to turn it off because they want to use iCloud there’s clearly a contradiction.<p>Therefore you must trust Apple. So if you still have issues then you don’t trust Apple.

            Why prefer your owned device tattling on you to Apple looking at data you give them on their servers?<p>The reason people don&#x27;t like this, as opposed to, for example, Dropbox scanning your synced files on their servers, is that a compute tool you ostensibly own is now turned completely against you. Today, that is for CSAM, tomorrow, what else?

            There’s no difference - all cloud services that aren’t encrypting your data is subject to the same thing. Dropbox could do the same thing tomorrow. If we’re talking about hypotheticals any vendor that handles your unencrypted files can do this now.

            You’re not understanding. Dropbox already does scan your files and I’m comparing Apples actions explicitly to that fact. I’m pointing out that people don’t care about that because you’re literally, voluntarily, giving Dropbox your files. Here, Apple is controlling your phone to tattle on you at an OS level (yes, I know, Apple says you need to turn on iCloud Photos for this to run but the precedent is the problem).

I don’t upload my most personal photos to Dropbox for this very specific reason. In fact I stopped using Dropbox when Condi Rice joined the board because she lacks good sense and doesn’t respect civil rights. See ‘The Patriot Act’ and ‘the Invasion of Afghanistan’. It was easy to stop using Dropbox because the alternatives were vast. Apple has me very purposely locked in to this scheme to where the alternatives are a huge transition and compromise on privacy no matter where I turn.

            big difference: you&#x27;re now paying for the compute load, instead of the cloud providers, for something that offers no direct benefit to you and will most likely betray you in unforeseen ways in the future (especially in less &#x27;free&#x27; countries)

            Open Source fanatics are the worst. Even if all the software on your phone was Open Source, you wouldn’t have the mental bandwidth to ever verify you trust it. You’re just farming out your trust to a different set of people and hoping they’re more trustworthy than those with closed source. At best this MAY be reasonable because of incentive alignment but that’s super weak.<p>Not to mention the meaning of ownership is completely unrelated to ability to view the designs of a given object. I think I own the fan currently blowing air at me without ever having seen a schematic for its controls circuitry just fine and everyone for all of history has pretty much felt the same.

            That&#x27;s because your fan is hardware and your phone is software.

            Here&#x27;s the distinction: I used to be able to use iCloud photos without having my photos scanned, and now I can&#x27;t.

With your logic any feature in any product can be &quot;turned off&quot; by not using the entire product at all.  For example, the radio in my car sounds like shit, I guess I should just stop driving completely to avoid having to hear it.<p>In reality, this new &quot;feature&quot; will be a requirement of using iCloud Photos.  The feature itself cannot be turned off.  If your answer is to stop using iCloud Photos, that is no help for the millions of people who currently use iCloud Photos.<p>&gt; If you don’t trust Apple why would you use iCloud anyway? Makes no sense.<p>I&#x27;ve trusted Apple for a long time because I felt like they were one of the only companies that cared about consumer privacy.  After these actions I am less convinced of that.

            &gt; In reality, this new &quot;feature&quot; will be a requirement of using iCloud Photos. The feature itself cannot be turned off.

Clearly Apple does care more about privacy than most other tech companies.

I shouldn&#x27;t have to jump through extra hoops to avoid that, and it&#x27;s reasonable to dislike Apple&#x27;s position on this.  In order to replicate the same functionality I would have to remember to sync my phone every night, and if I ever forgot and my phone died, I just lost data.  Yours is an indefensible position when a MUCH easier solution exists today.<p>&gt;  I assume you’re going to stick with iCloud even despite this “privacy” issue?

One is that it&#x27;s a pain in the ass to switch providers, so I&#x27;m going to wait and see if Apple actually follows through with it.  Two is that it&#x27;s possible that Apple is only implementing this so that they can in fact implement full e2ee and then tell law enforcement to kick rocks when they ask for user data (only allowing them to see the CSAM results before they are uploaded to the cloud).  I might be willing to accept that compromise, but it&#x27;s not clear that that is what their plan is.

            This is already possible if you self host your stuff. I’m talking about iCloud specifically here - backups are not encrypted so it’s either scan in the backend or scan on the client.<p>If you don’t want to be scanned you can turn it off.

            Would this work as an attack?<p>1. Get a pornographic picture involving young though legal actors and actresses.<p>2. Encode a nonce into the image.  Hash it checking for CSAM collisions.  If you&#x27;ve found a collision go on to the next step, if not update the nonce and try again.<p>3. You now have an image that, to visual inspection will appear plausibly like CSAM, and to automated detection will appear like CSAM.  Though, presumably, it is not illegal for you to have this image as it is, in fact, legal pornography.

            Your hash will match to say image 105 of the dataset. Upon visual inspection, your &#x27;legal porn&#x27; is going to have to at least look passably like image 105 of the dataset to get anywhere.<p>So at this point we have an image that computers think is CSAM and people think is CSAM, and when held up next to the original verified horrific image everyone agrees is the same image.

            No, probably wouldnt even get to the desk of the police.

            Right, and what in there suggests to you that Apple can view an image after a sufficient number of images match? I see the opposite: &quot;Apple can’t access metadata or visual derivatives for matched CSAM images until a 
threshold of matches is exceeded for an iCloud Photos account.&quot;<p>That suggests that Apple can&#x27;t access the actual matched CSAM images at all.<p>&gt; You should also point out that the NCMEC themselves are not law enforcment.<p>I don&#x27;t think the distinction is relevant.

            Good point.  I can offer three possibilities to how you might know.  First, a data leak of the material.  Second, law enforcement presumably gives hashes of known CSAM to service operators so they can detect and report it.  You could pose as or be the operator of such a service and get the hashes that way.  Third, if you were a government operator you may have access to the hashes that way.  (Although I guess corrupt government agents would have other easier ways of getting to you)

            Yes. That, plus it&#x27;s unclear whether you can create a collision with a nonce. It&#x27;s a perceptual hash, not a cryptographic one. Lastly, to compute that collision might be so expensive that you could instead compute small SHA-256 hashes, ie mine BTC, and use the money to obtain your sinister goals via other means.

            Iirc the rationale for doing it clientside isn&#x27;t saving money, but maintaining encryption. If it&#x27;s checked client side, Apple should never get unencrypted uploads unless they&#x27;re suspected to be CSAM

            For everyone upset about Apple&#x27;s CSAM scanning, I think we all forgot about the EARN IT Act. It was nearly passed last year but Congress was finished before it could be voted on. It had Bipartisan support and would&#x27;ve virtually banned E2E of any kind. And it would have required scanning everywhere according to the recommendations of a 19-member board of NGOs and unelected experts. The reason for this mandatory backdoor was child safety... even though AG Barr admitted that reducing the use of encryption had useful side effects.<p>If you are Apple, even though EARN IT failed... you know where Washington&#x27;s heart lies. Is CSAM scanning a &quot;better alternative&quot;, a concession, an appeasement, a lesser evil, in the hope this prevents EARN IT from coming back?<p>Also, many people forgot about the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act of 2020, or LAED, which would <i>unilaterally banned</i> E2E encryption <i>in entirety</i> and required that all devices featuring encryption <i>must be unlockable</i> by the manufacturer. That also was on the table.

            They did, they lobbied <i>heavily</i> against EARN IT, and so did groups like the ACLU and EFF.

            While I broadly agree that this (and other attempts in Australia and rumblings about it in UK) may have been the impetus for developing the technology, I&#x27;m not sure it explains why they released it on Photos, where Apple holds the keys, and not very far since you can look at your entire photo roll on icloud.com with just your username and password.<p>That tech is not being deployed on iMessage which is the only e2ee(ish) service from Apple (with Keychain) and is what those legislative attempts are usually targeting. One could argue it would have made sense (technically) there though, sure.<p>Was it a reason to release it preventively, on something unrelated, to be in the good graces of legislators ? I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a good calculation, and it doesn&#x27;t cover other platforms like Signal and Telegram that would still be seen as a problem by those legislators and require them to legislate anyway.

            This seems like speculation with no evidence.

            The EARN IT Act would have basically legally mandated a backdoor in all services, with shifting recommendations, in the name of preventing the spread of CSAM. Sound familiar?<p>Also, there is another reason why there is the CSAM Detecting and Reporting system. With Apple CSAM Scan, that big &quot;excuse&quot; Congress was planning to use through EARN IT to ban E2E is diffused, meaning now Apple has the potential to add E2E to their iCloud service before Congress can figure out a different excuse.

            &gt;which would unilaterally banned E2E encryption in entirety<p>It did not do this. The bill was essentially asking for search warrants to become a part of the protocol.

            Technically in the real world you can get jailed for anything as long as corruption  exists and humans remain imperfect.<p>But you <i>shouldn’t</i> get jailed for protected speech and you <i>shouldn’t</i> get jailed for preserving your privacy (via encryption or otherwise.) As cynical as people may get, this is one thing that we have to agree on if we want to live in a free society.<p>And above all, most <i>certainly</i>, we shouldn’t allow being jailed over encryption to become codified as law, and if it does, we <i>certainly</i> must fight it and not become complacent.<p>Apathy over politics, especially these days, is understandable with the flood of terrible news and highly divisive topics, but we shouldn’t let the fight for privacy become a victim to apathy. (And yes, I realize big tech surveillance creep is a fear, but IMO we’re starting to get into more direct worst cases now.)

            &gt; [..] the overall system is designed to account for this to happen in general, and that the analyzed code is not the final implementation that will be used with the CSAM system itself and is instead a generic version.<p>I think the claim here is that you won&#x27;t have access to the source images, and therefore generating collisions will be more difficult. But, if you do have access to the source images, this has been shown to be trivial. This of course doesn&#x27;t stop nations states generating images that cause hash collisions, in fact they would be incentivized to do so.<p>I would also add that Apple are behind the curve, attempts to crack the hashing algorithm more efficiently are still ongoing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AsuharietYgvar&#x2F;AppleNeuralHash2ONNX&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AsuharietYgvar&#x2F;AppleNeuralHash2ONNX&#x2F;issue...</a><p>&gt; [..] not the final implementation [..]<p>Why on earth would you invite people to come and test your algorithm and then say &quot;sure, you broke it, but it&#x27;s not the real one&quot;. This kind of defeats the point and seems like some bait and switch bullshit. I suspect this is some retroactive cope from management realising they can&#x27;t deploy this version and whatever they do deploy needs to be heavily modified.<p>&gt; If Apple finds they are CSAM, it will report the user to law enforcement.<p>One statistic I want to know is: How many people <i>already</i> trigger this report function in the wild? Surely currently is the <i>largest</i> number of positives they will ever have - if it turns out to be 0% - Apple should just scrap it.<p>&gt; Apple also said that after a user passes the 30 match threshold, a second non-public algorithm that runs on Apple&#x27;s servers will check the results.<p>So to avoid reporting, simply block Apple servers? Also, security by obscurity is <i>not</i> security - the algorithm supposedly being private just means that its not properly tested and Apple is not held to account.<p>&gt; &quot;Apple actually designed this system so the hash function doesn&#x27;t need to remain secret, as the only thing you can do with &#x27;non-CSAM that hashes as CSAM&#x27; is annoy Apple&#x27;s response team with some garbage images until they implement a filter to eliminate those garbage false positives in their analysis pipeline,&quot; Nicholas Weaver, senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley, told Motherboard in an online chat.<p>No. A report could be considered &#x27;reasonable doubt&#x27; for law enforcement to do a full search. Imagine trying to explain to a judge why your iPhone shouldn&#x27;t be searched because of a false-positive CSAM hash collision because of a malicious website you visited or a text message you received.
